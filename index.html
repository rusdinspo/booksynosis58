Miner has been a minister for over 20 years. While in active ministry, she became aware of how expensive ministerial vestments are. When Rev. Cheryl retired from active ministry, she was inspired to use her previous sewing and design experience to enable her fellow clerics to make their own vestments. It is her hope and prayer that this book, which is the fruit of four years of vestment designing and sewing, will allow everyone in the ministry to be beautifully vested without having to make a big dent in their budgets.</p><h2>The Rights of Nature: A Legal Revolution That Could Save the World</h2><p><p><b>An important and timely recipe for hope for humans and all forms of life</b></p> <p><i>Palila v Hawaii</i>. New Zealand&#x2019;s <i>Te Urewera Act</i>. <i>Sierra Club v Disney</i>. These legal phrases hardly sound like the makings of a revolution, but beyond the headlines portending environmental catastrophes, a movement of immense import has been building &#x2015; in courtrooms, legislatures, and communities across the globe. Cultures and laws are transforming to provide a powerful new approach to protecting the planet and the species with whom we share it.</p> <p>Lawyers from California to New York are fighting to gain legal rights for chimpanzees and killer whales, and lawmakers are ending the era of keeping these intelligent animals in captivity. In Hawaii and India, judges have recognized that endangered species &#x2015; from birds to lions &#x2015; have the legal right to exist. Around the world, more and more laws are being passed recognizing that ecosystems &#x2015; rivers, forests, mountains, and more &#x2015; have legally enforceable rights. And if nature has rights, then humans have responsibilities.</p> <p>In <i>The Rights of Nature</i>, noted environmental lawyer David Boyd tells this remarkable story, which is, at its heart, one of humans as a species finally growing up. Read this book and your world view will be altered forever.</p></p><p><br>- Cross-promotion to the mailing lists of the David Suzuki Foundation and Ecojustice.<br> <br>- Pitching major news organizations across North America.<br> <br>- Pitching to environmental news blogs.<br> <br>- The book will be cross-promoted with our other titles on environmental issues, and packaged in price promotions.<br> <br>- Galleys available for request on NetGalley and Edelweiss.<br> <br>- Leaderboard ad in Shelf Awareness Pro confirmed.<br><p><b>David R.

And they're usually ready to tell others how to do their jobs &#x201c;better.&#x201d; Control freaks. Maybe you know one. Maybe you <i>are</i> one. What are you to do? Psychologist Les Parrott (a recovering control freak) helps readers relate better to the control freaks around them. And if <i>you</i> are a control freak, Les will help you become willing to lose the control you love. The book includes self-tests and a lifelong prescription for healthier relationships.</p><p></p><h2>Lectures on the Philosophy of History</h2><p>This is the first complete translation in over 150 years of what many consider to be Hegel&#39;s most accessible work. The Lectures on the Philosophy of History are a tour-de-force, an audacious attempt to summarize world history and the purpose behind it. Was Hegel the progenitor of the power-state that unified Germany became? The Lectures, the mature fruit of Hegel&#39;s thought, provide many relevant clues. Hegel saw the growth of freedom as the purpose behind history, but he also argued that such freedom could not take root and flourish apart from a state able to impose and enforce the rule of law.</p><p></p><h2>Lucifer&#39;s Court: A Heretic&#39;s Journey in Search of the Light Bringers</h2><p>Rahn&#x2019;s personal diary from his travels as occult investigator for the Third Reich <br><br>� First English translation of the author&#x2019;s journeys in search of a Nordic equivalent to Mt.

She&#x2019;s back with the Novels of the Elder Races, a paranormal romance series. Thea lives in California with her family.Pia was blackmailed into committing a crime more suicidal than she could possibly have imagined, and she had no one to blame but herself.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing that didn&#x2019;t make it easier. She couldn&#x2019;t believe she had been so lacking in good judgment, taste or sensibility.</p><p>Honestly what had she done? She had taken one look at a pretty face and forgotten everything her mom had taught her about survival. It sucked so bad she might as well put a gun to her head and pull the trigger. Except she didn&#x2019;t own a gun because she didn&#x2019;t like them. Besides, pulling the trigger on a gun was pretty final. She had issues with commitment and she was so freaking dead anyway, so why bother.</p><p>A taxi horn blared. In New York the sound was so common everyone ignored it, but this time it made her jump. She threw a glance over one hunched shoulder.</p><p>Her life was in ruins. She would be on the run for the rest of her life, all fifteen minutes or so of it, thanks to her own foolish behavior and her <i>shithead</i> ex who had screwed her, then screwed her over so royally she couldn&#x2019;t get over the knife-like sensation in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She stumbled into a narrow trash-strewn street by a Korean restaurant. She uncapped a liter-sized water bottle and chugged half it down, one hand splayed on the cement wall while she watched the sidewalk traffic. Steam from the restaurant kitchen enveloped her in the rich red-pepper and soy scents of gochujang and ganjang sauces, overlaying the garbage rot of a nearby dumpster and the acrid exhaust from the traffic.</p><p>The people in the street looked much as they always did, driven by internal forces as they charged along the sidewalk and shouted on cell phones. A few mumbled to themselves as they dug through trash cans and looked at the world with lost wary eyes. Everything looked normal. So far so good?</p><p>After a long nightmarish week, she had just committed the crime. She had stolen from one of the most dangerous creatures on Earth, a creature so frightening that just imagining him was more scariness than she ever wanted to meet in real life. Now she was almost done. A couple more stops to make, one more meeting with the shithead, and then she could scream for oh say a couple of days or so while she figured out where she would run to hide.</p><p>Holding on to that thought she strode down the street until she came to the Magic District. Located east of the Garment District and north of Koreatown, the New York Magic District was sometimes called the Cauldron. It was comprised of several city blocks that seethed with light and dark energies.</p><p>The Cauldron flaunted <i>caveat emptor</i> like a prizefighter&#x2019;s satin cloak. The area was stacked several stories high with kiosks and shops offering Tarot readings, psychic consultations, fetishes and spells, retail and wholesale sellers, imports, those who dealt with fake merchandise and those who sold magic items that were deadly real. Even from the distance of a city block, the area assaulted her senses.</p><p>She came to a shop located at the border of the district. The storefront was painted sage-green on outside, with the molding at the plate-glass windows and door painted pale yellow. She took a backwards step to look up. The name DIVINUS was spelled in plain brushed-metal lettering over the front window. Years ago her mother had on occasion bought spells from the witch who owned this shop. Her boss Quentin had also mentioned the witch had one of the strongest magical talents he had ever met in a human.</p><p>She looked in the storefront. Her blurred reflection looked back her, a tired young woman, built rather long and coltish, with tense features and a pale tangled ponytail. She looked past herself into the shadowed interior.</p><p>In contrast to the noisy none-too-clean surroundings of the city street, the inside of the shop appeared cool and serene. The building seemed to glow with warmth. She recognized protection spells in place. In a display case near the door harmonic energies sparked from an alluring arrangement of crystals, amethyst, peridot, rose quartz, blue topaz and celestite. The crystals took the slanting sunshine and threw brilliant rainbow shards of light onto the ceiling. Her gaze found the single occupant inside, a tall queen-like woman, perhaps Hispanic, with a gaze that connected to hers with a snap of Power.</p><p>That was when the shouting started.</p></p><h2>Cutthroats (A Slash and Pecos Western)</h2><p><b>JOHNSTONE. KEEPING THE WEST WILD.<br></b><br> Not every Western hero wears a white hat or a tin star. Most of them are just fighting to survive. Some of them can be liars, cheaters, and thieves.

It was Beebe&#39;s field studies and practical experience that led to his pioneering successes in breeding captive falcons in the early 1960s. His artistic talents not only contribute to the concise illustrations on how to capture and train birds but how to easily make all falconry hardware.One of the all-time best books for new Apprentices to learn about training a new hawk or falcon and one of the best selling falconry books ever produced.</p><p>Frank Beebe is one of North America&#39;s most experienced falconers. Born in Canada, he received his introduction to raptorial birds at the age of ten; since that time he has gained extensive experience in trapping and training raptors. He has also played a leading role in training Eskimo people in the methods of trapping, care and export of arctic gyrfalcons. It was Beebe&#39;s field studies and practical experience that led to his pioneering successes in breeding captive falcons in the early 1960&#39;s. His artistic talents not only contribute to the concise illustrations on how to capture and train birds but on how to easily make all the falconry hardware.<blockquote><p>This is a great little book. Frank Beebe packs all the essential information around hawk training into this book, drawing on decades of practical experience and research. Beebe writes with the authority of someone who has actually practiced what he is preaching, rather than some authors who seem to have written a falconry book for the sake of personal aggrandizement. He also writes in excellent English, almost with an academic eloquence. He deals with all three classes of falconry birds: buteos, accipiters and falcons, and draws very useful comparisons between them on temperament, character and hunting application.&nbsp;<strong>-- Amazon Reviewer</strong></p></blockquote></p><h2>Finding Joy: 101 Ways to Free Your Spirit and Dance with Life</h2><p>Combining spiritual insight with pragmatic guidance, this lighthearted yet practical handbook shows readers how to live a more balanced, richer life.</p><p><br>Charlotte D. Kasl is a social activist and a psychologist at the forefront of the empowerment movement sweeping the recovery field. She lectures and leads workshops in the United States and abroad and lives near Missoula, MT.<b>Awaken Your Inner Fire</b>Joy is a source of personal power. Joy awakens as we open ourselves to the wonder of the universe both inside us and around us. As we allow the expansive power of joy to flow through us, our awareness expands and we see beyond the concrete world to a world of love, intimacy, creativity, and wisdom.<p>We create room for joy as we move beyond "shoulds" and "musts" to an expansive state where we accept our capacity to be both powerful and gentle, expansive and reclusive, delighted and bored, wise and confused, passive and assertive, giving and receptive, generous and withholding, frightened and adventuresome, angry and loving. As we become accepting of ourselves we are more able to reach inside and speak our truths: Yes, No, I want, I can, I feel, I believe, I see, I love. This is a form of self-love that creates unity and peacefulness within because we are living at one with our wisest self.Joy leads us to the heart of our spiritual journey because it ignites the fire of transformation that enables us to change our thoughts, perceptions, and feelings. In doing so we are able to transcend an empty, humdrum existence and infuse our lives with vitality, awareness, and the ability to move beyond the limited boundaries of self. Finding joy doesn't mean life will always be easy, rather life becomes rich because we live near the pulse of possibility. To open the door you can start by saying, I am willing. I am willing to feel, to Know, to love, and to expand. I am willing to let the concrete walls of my beliefs slip away and move into a new level of awareness.</p><p>In his "Ode to Joy," the German poet Friedrich Schiller wrote, "By that holy fire impassioned, to thy sanctuary we come." When we allow ourselves to feel joy, we create an inner sanctuary, a home for the soul that allows us to feel safe to laugh, cry, be angry, question, and think for ourselves. When we create this home for truth and delight, we feel a sense of inner strength. Unkind remarks and difficult situations lose their ability to singe our souls or tear at our hearts because we are no longer candles in the wind. Rather, we become the fire of life itself--a being, an identity that cannot be blown about or extinguished by external events because we accept all of who we are.</p><p>Remember Joy and Find Hope<br>Hope is the thing with feathers<br>That perches in the soul<br>And sings the tune without the words<br>And never stops, at all.<br>--Emily Dickinson</p><p>Joy brings hope and hope brings joy. Imagine joy as a memory dwelling within you--a bird perched on your soul singing a song of hope. Let yourself know it is always there. Sometimes we lose contact with that voice and feel despair. In those times, if we can remember that the potential for joy lives within us, we may regain hope and find the strength to take steps to improve our lives.</p><p>If you feel down, blue, depressed, or tend to be hard on yourself, take time to remember the good things you have done for yourself, the risks you have taken, the ways you have survived. Remember times when you experienced contentment or joy. Then hold these images in your heart and tell yourself you can re-create them. You have the power to create happiness in your life--the potential for joy is within you. You might ask yourself what in your life right now blocks you from feeling joy, and consider what you need to do to get on a path toward greater happiness.</p><p>The bird of joy that "perches in the soul" never stops singing--we just stop listening. When we can hear the promise of joy within us, we have more power to come alive to our desire for life.</p><p></p><p>Prepare for Joy</p><p>Joy may seem illusive or fleeting, yet there is a path we can walk that brings the delight, passion, and sweetness of joy into our lives, sweeping over us, filling us, transporting us, making life feel worth the trouble. Joy may appear to come suddenly, but in reality we prepare for joy every time we speak our truths, care for ourselves, expand our knowledge, nurture our friendships, let people love us, take on new adventures, and go where our hearts lead us.</p><p>My friend Janet is about to have her second baby. She has developed a strong bond with her husband; created a cozy living space, a network of friends, a good job; has read a great deal on parenting; and has enjoyed her first child. She has also spent many years investing in her personal growth. In other words, over the years she has built a nest for herself, both physical and emotional, that enables joy to flourish amid the fears and difficulties of having a new child.</p><p>Preparation for joy can span the decades of our lives and even go back to the time of our ancestors. For example, I am currently making plans to go backpacking. Preparation began a couple of months ago when I started working out at a gym to strengthen my leg muscles. Or perhaps preparation started even earlier, when I took a racketball class fifteen years ago in an attempt to get regular exercise. Or was it when I was a child, and experienced the wonder and joy of hiking with my father in the pristine forests and mountains of Montana? Is that when I started preparing? I remember back even further, to stories from my grandmother, a botanist, about taking her young children out in the woods for walks and picnics, and I realize that joy is passed down through the ages. It is a paradox to say we are always preparing for joy, because when we prepare for joy--living by love and our heart's desire--we are experiencing it as well.</p></p><h2>Calling All Years Good: Christian Vocation throughout Life&#39;s Seasons</h2><p><i>A uniquely comprehensive discussion of vocation from infancy to old age</i><br><br> Do infants have a vocation? Do Alzheimer's patients? In popular culture, vocation is often reduced to adult work or church ministry. Rarely do we consider childhood or old age as crucial times for commencing or culminating a life of faith in response to God's calling.<br><br> This book addresses that gap by showing how vocation emerges and evolves over the course of an entire lifetime. The authors cover six of life's distinct seasons, weaving together personal narrative, developmental theory, case studies, and spiritual practices.&nbsp;<i>Calling All Years Good</i>&nbsp;grounds the discussion of vocation in concrete realities and builds a cohesive framework for understanding calling throughout all of life.</p><p>Kathleen A.

By focusing on the distinctive character of vocation in different seasons of life, the authors help us to understand and appreciate the gifts and challenges of each. Their work will inform and inspire those who minister with a specific age group, such as children, youth, or the elderly. Further, it will encourage intergenerational communities of faith&#x2014;especially congregations&#x2014;to cultivate relationships across age-group lines, strengthening the capacity of all to respond to God's call.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Edward P.

These chapters widen our vocational vision beyond that crucial time of young adulthood in order to contemplate the many ways God calls each of us at every moment of our lives.

In Wicca, it is normally copied by hand from the book of one's initiating High Priestess or Priest, who copied theirs from their initiator. In modern Eclectic Wiccan terminology, however, a Book of Shadows is a personal magical journal rather than a traditional text.<br><br>Within traditional lineaged forms of Wicca there are a number of versions of the Book of Shadows, their contents varying to a greater or lesser degree from the early versions belonging to Gerald Gardner, who first popularised Wicca. While Gardner seems to have originally treated the book as a personal journal, it has come to be considered a religious text in most traditions. <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i><br><br><b>About the Author</b><br><br>Napoleon Hill (1883 - 1970)<br>Napoleon Hill (October 26, 1883-November 8, 1970) was an American author who was one of the earliest producers of the modern genre of personal-success literature. His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich, is one of the best-selling books of all time. In America, Hill stated in his writings, people are free to believe what they want to believe, and this is what sets the United States apart from all other countries in the world. Hill's works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. "What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions. How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach for the average person, were the promise of Hill's books.<br><br>Hill called his success teachings "The Philosophy of Achievement" an</p><p>Gerald Brosseau Gardner (author and amateur archaeologist and anthropologist) was born in 1884, at Blundellsands, Lancashire, to an upper middle class family. Much of his childhood was spent abroad in Madeira, (a Portuguese archipelago). In 1900 he moved to colonial Ceylon, (now Sri Lanka), and in 1911 to Malaya where he worked as a civil servant. While there he developed an interest in the native peoples and wrote papers and a book about their magical practices. After retiring in 1936, he settled in New Forest, (the south of England) and joined the occult group, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, through which he claimed to have encountered the New Forest coven into which he was initiated. He believed the coven to be a survival of the pre-Christian Witch-Cults as described in the works of Margaret Murray. He decided to revive the Old Faith, adding to the Coven&#39;s rituals ideas borrowed from Freemasonry, ceremonial magic and the writings of Aleister Crowley. From this he formed the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca. He was known by the craft name of Scire. He died in 1964.</p><h2>Is the Bible from Heaven?

First, everyone else gets a piece of cake with a frosting rose. But not Bernice. Then, everyone else gets strawberry-melon soda. Bernice gets the prune-grapefruit juice. And it's warm. The last straw is the one lousy (squished) candy she gets from the pi�ata. So when the balloons arrive, Bernice knows just what she has to do: grab them&nbsp;<i>all</i>. And then, poor cross Bernice gets carried up, up, and away. Luckily, she figures out just how to make her way back down to the party...and she brightens lots of other animals' days on her way.<br><br>Hannah Harrison&#x2019;s gorgeous animal paintings come alive in her second picture book. Her &#x201c;exceptionally polished&#x201d; debut, <i>Extraordinary Jane</i>, received starred reviews from <i>Kirkus</i>, <i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i>, and&nbsp; <i>School Library Journal. </i><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah Harrison is an award-winning painter, specializing in animals. She lives with her family in Ada, Oklahoma.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;The story line of Harrison's latest picture book doesn't break any new ground&#x2014;a group of cute anthropomorphized animals attend a birthday party, one of whom feels like the odd cat out&#x2014;but it's her skillful illustrations, candy-colored palette, and understated humor that elevate this tale of a bad mood turned around. The scene opens on an overcast day in the park as a group of furry partygoers gathers. In the foreground is Bernice, an unhappy tabby whose darling pink romper and Peter Pan-collared shirt belie her defiantly crossed arms and angry scowl. The other guests each receive a frosting rose on their piece of cake&#x2014;poor Bernice only gets a plain white square. Everyone else gets ice-cold strawberry-melon soda&#x2014;Bernice gets warm prune-grapefruit. Harrison depicts the happy-go-lucky guests enjoying the festivities on the verso, while sourpuss Bernice is juxtaposed on the recto, isolated on an all-white background, her feelings clearly evident in her petulant expression. The frustrated feline finally decides she's had enough and absconds with a bunch of balloons, unintentionally floating up, up, and away. It's when she encounters a brooding black rain cloud&#x2014;having a bad day himself&#x2014;that she discovers a bit of empathy within and is able to put her own problems in perspective, cheering up a "very blue bluebird" and a "surly gray squirrel" as her own mood reverses. The text is kept to a minimum, with carefully chosen words that lend the narrative a dry humor. Young readers who've experienced moments of jealousy and frustration can't help but feel a bit of kinship with Bernice. Harrison includes clever details, like the "Do Not Perturb" and "Home is Where the Nuts Are" signs that adorn the entrance to the squirrel's home. Her acrylic on Bristol board illustrations artfully play with perspective, light, and texture, making Harrison an illustrator to watch. VERDICT Though the rainbow-hued ending comes a bit too easily, young listeners will be satisfied when all the animal friends rejoice at Bernice's change of heart.&#x2014;Kiera Parrott, School Library Journal</p><h2>Guitar Chord Encyclopedia: 36 Chords in Each Key, Comb Bound Book</h2><p>Chords are listed alphabetically and chromatically for easy reference with 36 different chords listed for each key.

It marked the beginning of Hezbollah as a political force, but even more important, it eliminated America&#x2019;s most influential and effective intelligence officer in the Middle East &#x2013; CIA operative Robert Ames.&nbsp; What set Ames apart from his peers was his extraordinary ability to form deep, meaningful connections with key Arab intelligence figures. Some operatives relied on threats and subterfuge, but Ames worked by building friendships and emphasizing shared values &#x2013; never more notably than with Yasir Arafat&#x2019;s charismatic intelligence chief and heir apparent Ali Hassan Salameh (aka &#x201c;The Red Prince&#x201d;). Ames&#x2019; deepening relationship with Salameh held the potential for a lasting peace.&nbsp; Within a few years, though, both men were killed by assassins, and America&#x2019;s relations with the Arab world began heading down a path that culminated in 9/11, the War on Terror, and the current fog of mistrust.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bird, who as a child lived in the Beirut Embassy and knew Ames as a neighbor when he was twelve years old, spent years researching <i>The Good Spy.&nbsp; </i>Not only does the book draw on hours of interviews with Ames&#x2019; widow, and quotes from hundreds of Ames&#x2019; private letters, it&#x2019;s woven from interviews with scores of current and former American, Israeli, and Palestinian intelligence officers as well as other players in the Middle East &#x201c;Great Game.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>What emerges is a masterpiece-level narrative of the making of a CIA officer, a uniquely insightful history of twentieth-century conflict in the Middle East, and an absorbing hour-by-hour account of the Beirut Embassy bombing.&nbsp; Even more impressive, Bird draws on his reporter&#x2019;s skills to deliver a full dossier on the bombers and expose the shocking truth of where the attack&#x2019;s mastermind resides today.</p><p>KAI BIRD is the coauthor or author of four previous books: <i>American Prometheus, Crossing Mandelbaum Gate, The Chairman</i>, and <i>The Color of Truth.&nbsp; </i>He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a MacArthur Writing Fellowship.<b><i>New York Times</i> Bestseller<br><br>A <i>Washington Post </i>Notable Book<br><br>A <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> Top Ten Book, 2014<br></b><br><b><i>New York Times Book Review </i>Editor's Choice<br></b><br><b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s Best Spy Book of 2014<br><br>A Daily Beast Best Biography of 2014<br><br>An Apple Top 10 Biography of 2014<br></b><br>&#x201c;A rich nuanced portrait of a man who, in the CIA's term, had a high tolerance for ambiguity...<b>One of the best accounts we have of how espionage really works</b>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mark Mazzetti, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Cool and authoritative...<b>The book&#x2019;s understated pleasures come from reading a pro writing about a pro.</b> Mr. Bird has a dry style; watching him compose a book is like watching a robin build a nest.

That is because the ministries themselves are not redemptive--they are not up to you. Only Jesus&#39; ministry is redemptive. Jesus has to &#34;show up.&#34; Theologian Andrew Purves explores at the deepest level the true and essential nature of Christian ministry. He says that the attempt to be an effective minister is a major problem. Ministers are &#34;in the way.&#34; He radically claims that ministries need to be crucified. They need to be killed off so that Christ can make them live. Rooting church service in Christ&#39;s own continuing ministry, Purves provides a vision for students and practicing clergy to reclaim the vital connection between Christ and participation in his ministry today, even if it means letting Christ put to death the ministries to which pastors cling so closely. A radical appraisal for a critical malady affecting the life of the Christian church written in plain, down-to-earth language.</p><p><strong>Andrew Purves</strong> holds the Hugh Thomson Kerr Chair in Pastoral Theology at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Reconstructing Pastoral Theology: A Christological Foundation</em> (Westminster John Knox, 2004).Containing only five chapters, this book is packed with a lot of truth, helpful ideas, and suggested practices. A book like this will help current seminarians and future miniters to avoid some of the pitfalls of ministry. Purves does a great job in going to the text in numerous places to get the reader to see the biblical truth instead of the author's ideas. (Terry Lange, SharperIron, (sharperiron.org), October 2, 2008)<br><br>Certainly worth recommending to pastors and others in full-time ministry. (Rodney Stent, The Lamplighter, May 2008)<br><br>All in all, the significance of the subject matter and its general readability make this book an important read for those wishing to locate their practical ministry on the horizon of the doctrinal tradition of the Church. (Phil Sumpter, Chrisendom, May 4, 2008 ay 4, 2008)<br><br>Purves challenges pastors to look deeply at their ministry and realize that it is not theirs but God?s. He encourages pastors to allow themselves to be used by God rather than attempt to do things for God. His simple argument is stated eloquently and most certainly bears repeating to an individualistic world. (Pulpit Helps, October 2007)<br><br>"Every pastor and Christian leader needs to read this book--about once a year. It is a much-needed wake-up call to remember what we all so often forget: it's Christ's ministry, not ours, and for his ministry to manifest itself through us, we must first die to ours. Written with clarity and passion, there is much here that is theologically rich, spiritually challenging and practically relevant. The North American church today desperately needs to heed the message of Andrew Purves's book." (Stephen A. Seamands, professor of Christian doctrine, Asbury Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Andrew Purves has peeked inside our ministerial closets. He has pulled aside the fa�ade of our pastoral garb. He exposes the fear and exhaustion so many of us feel but none admit. Then he offers us pastors the real hope found in reconnecting to the true Source of all ministry. The church would be transformed if pastors dared to read, and practice, this book." (Gerrit Dawson, senior pastor, First Presbyterian Church of Baton Rouge)<br><br>"I have been in Professor Purves's classes as he lectured on this theology of pastoral ministry. I watched our seminarians move from dismay to embracing it as a surprising new vision of ministry. It was like witnessing the crucifixion and resurrection, which is his point. I have been a pastor long enough to know that without this vision of what Jesus Christ is doing in human lives, no one will last long in the ministry." (M. Craig Barnes, pastor, Shadyside Presbyterian Church, and Meneilly Professor of Ministry, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This book is exactly what we in pastoral ministry have needed for a long time: 'strong medicine' to not only keep us from the burnout so many are facing in our time, but also, and primarily, to enable us to thrive in the service of Jesus Christ. Andrew Purves takes us into the heart of ministry, into the heart of the only ministry that actually 'works,' into the ministry of the risen Jesus, and teaches us how to participate in Jesus' vicarious humanity and, in union with him, to cooperate with Jesus' ongoing work in and for the world. As I read these pages, everything in me cries, 'Yes! This is the way to live and serve.'"

It existed for only a year&#x2014;from the summer of 1864 to July 1865&#x2014;but in that time, and for long after, it became darkly emblematic of man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man.<br><br>Confederate prisoners called it &#x201c;Hellmira.&#x201d;<br><br>Hastily constructed, poorly planned, and overcrowded, prisoner of war camps North and South were dumping grounds for the refuse of war. An unfortunate necessity, both sides regarded the camps as temporary inconveniences&#x2014;and distractions from the important task of winning the war. There was no need, they believed, to construct expensive shelters or provide better rations. They needed only to sustain life long enough for the war to be won. Victory would deliver prisoners from their conditions.<br><br>As a result, conditions in the prisoner of war camps amounted to a great humanitarian crisis, the extent of which could hardly be understood even after the blood stopped flowing on the battlefields.<br><br>In the years after the war, as Reconstruction became increasingly bitter, the North pointed to Camp Sumter&#x2014;better known as the Andersonville POW camp in Americus, Georgia&#x2014;as evidence of the cruelty and barbarity of the Confederacy.

Others may tune into an unspoken family conflict, or tell someone to "be careful" before stumbling into an unknown situation. These may seem to be the normal human qualities of intuition and empathy, but in highly intuitive children (and adults), such traits are supercharged. Growing up in a culture that favors the rational and the five senses can be difficult for gifted children. This book shows parents, teachers, and therapists how to help them and those around them embrace and exercise their gift. <i>The Highly Intuitive Child</i> covers a wealth of topics including: how to easily identify the intuitive child; how life is different for them; the 10 skills they must master before leaving home; the connections between neuroscience and intuition; what other cultures can teach us about supporting intuitive children; "indigo" children; success stories; and much more.</p><p>Silver medalists, 2010 Independent Book Publishers Association Ben Franklin Awards<br> A gentle and insightful approach to parenting children with highly intuitive abilities or sensitivities.

Conceding that all people have intuition and sensitivity, she argues that certain children are born with these traits functioning at a higher capacity, and they encounter specific challenges such as feeling responsible for others' emotions or absorbing group stress. She does not seek to lessen their sensitivity but rather to teach acceptance and self-help for their authentic nature, while helping parents understand how best to support them. Crawford identifies ten skills that intuitives should master, including differentiating between fears and intuition and distinguishing one's energy from others'. She is especially strong when discussing the value of art in a child's growing development...There are pearls of wisdom here for parents of children on the high end of the sensitivity spectrum, with or without intuitive abilities. Recommended for comprehensive parenting collections..." &#x2014;<b><i>Library Journal</i>, Julianne J. Smith, Ypsilanti Dist. Lib., MI</b><br><br>"Crawford, a psychotherapist, approaches her topic from the perspective of a professional who has dealt with many intuitive children during the past 20 years, and also as an intuitive individual herself. Children who are highly intuitive and empathic, she explains, both present and face unique challenges, and parents who are not particularly intuitive themselves may be shocked, perplexed and even frightened by their offspring's unusual gifts. While certain indigenous cultures have long regarded intuitive children in a positive light (such as the Inuit and ancient Mayans), mainstream America&#x2014;and its parenting books&#x2014;have avoided the topic, the author claims. Crawford steps up to the plate, dealing with the intuitive child's difficulties at home and at school, and encouraging parents to offer love and acceptance. She explains that empathic children often take on the weight of the world, and may become overly stressed by and sensitive to injustice. In a useful chapter, Crawford outlines 10 important skills that parents can teach intuitive children ranging from learning how to tell the difference between random fears and intuition, to how to turn down the volume on "intuitive antennae." While Crawford's audience may be somewhat limited, she offers sincere support and practical information to parents searching to aid and more deeply understand their highly intuitive child." - <b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br></p><h2>Cosori Air Fryer Cookbook: Deliciously Simple Recipes for Your Cosori Air Fryer (Air Fryer recipes)</h2><p><p><b><strong>Master Cosori Air Fryer&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Impress&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Family, Friends&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Guests!</strong></b></p><p>This Air Fryer cookbook is devoted to&nbsp;<strong>both beginner cooks and&nbsp;advanced cooks, passionate about crispy and delicious meals.</strong></p><p>In this Air Fryer recipes cookbook you will find the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Craveable&nbsp;and Irresistible air fryer&nbsp;recipes&nbsp;</strong>to make in your Cosori Air Fryer</li><li><strong>Modern Technique&nbsp;</strong>that&nbsp;<strong>will change the way you cook</strong></li><li><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks</strong>&nbsp;on how to use the&nbsp;<strong>Cosori Air Fryer</strong>&nbsp;in the best possible way</li><li>Lots of&nbsp;<strong>Crispy</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Yummy</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Meals&nbsp;</strong>made in<strong>&nbsp;no time</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>no-fuss</strong></li></ul><p>This Air Fryer cookbook is a<strong><em>&nbsp;will guide you</em></strong>&nbsp;if you are the type of person who loves&nbsp;<strong>fried</strong><strong>food&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>easy&nbsp;recipes!</strong></p></p><p></p><h2>Krsna: The Supreme Personality of Godhead</h2><p>Since time immemorial, yogis, sages, and mystics have forsaken the pleasures of the ordinary world and gone to secluded places to meditate, eager to attain even a momentary vision of Lord Sri Krsna. To help the realization and remembrance of those who wished to fully absorb their consciousness in Him, Sri Krsna descended to earth from His transcendental abode five thousand years ago and revealed His eternal spiritual pastimes. The great sage Vyasadeva carefully recorded those pastimes in his Sanskrit writings, headed by Srimad-Bhagavatam, the crown jewel of all Vedic literature. &#34;Krsna&#34; is Srila Prabhupada&#39;s summary study of the Bhagavatam&#39;s essence -- its Tenth Canto -- and is thus the first comprehensive exposition in English of those extraordinary events. These stories transport the reader from the mundane and commonplace, beckoning him to participate in a miraculous journey to a transcendental realm beyond space and time, a realm where everything and everyone lives in the blissful light of the Supreme Absolute, an eternal transcendental youth -- Lord Sri Krsna, the ultimate object of knowledge and the supreme goal of life. This one-volume edition of Krsna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead will inspire the sincere reader to ever-new levels of spiritual experience each time he or she opens its covers.</p><p>His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent religious scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes) in India, liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student and, in 1933, his formally initiated disciple. At their first meeting Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge in English. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya Matha in its work, and, in 1944, started Back to Godhead, an English fortnightly magazine. Single-handedly, Srila Prabhupada edited it, typed the manuscripts, checked the galley proofs, and even distributed the individual copies. The magazine is now being continued by his disciples in the West. In 1950 Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, adopting the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writing. He traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in humble circumstances in the historic temple of Radha- Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sanyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life&#39;s masterpiece: a multivolume commentated translation of the eighteen-thousand-verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets. After publishing three volumes of the Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the United States, in September 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Subsequently, His Divine Grace wrote more than fifty volumes of authoritative commentated translations and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of India. When he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada was practically penniless. Only after almost a year of great difficulty did he establish the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, in July of 1966. Before he passed away on November 14, 1977, he had guided the Society and seen it grow to a worldwide confederation of more than one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes, and farm communities. Srila Prabhupada also inspired the construction of several large international cultural centers in India. The center at Sridhama Mayapur is the site for a planned spiritual city, an ambitious project for which construction will extend over many years to come. In Vrndavana are the magnificent Krsna-Balarama Temple and International Guesthouse, gurukula school, and Srila Prabhupada Memorial and Museum. There is also a major cultural and educational center in Bombay. Major centers are planned in Delhi and in a dozen other important locations on the Indian subcontinent. Srila Prabhupada&#39;s most significant contribution, however, is his books. Highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth, and clarity, they are used as textbooks in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into over fifty languages. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1972 to publish the works of His Divine Grace, has thus become the world&#39;s largest publisher of books in the field of Indian religion and philosophy. In just twelve years, despite his advanced age, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe fourteen times on lecture tours that took him to six continents. Yet this vigorous schedule did not slow his prolific literary output. His writings constitute a veritable library of Vedic philosophy, religion, literature, and culture.</p><h2>Tandy Leather Making Leather Knife Sheaths Vol. 3 61966-03 (Making Leather Knife Sheaths, 3)</h2><p>This book shows how a welted leather sheath for a fixed blade is designed and constructed.

A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.Gracie Marsh's cell phone exploded with the theme to the newest science fiction motion picture. She jumped, and dirt from the ground where she was busily cleaning out her flower beds splattered her spotless yellow sweatshirt.<br><br>"Oh, darn," she muttered, wiping her hands on her old jeans before she dived into a pocket for the very loud instrument.<br><br>"Where's that music coming from?" Mrs. Harcourt, the housekeeper, called from the front porch, where she was setting out pansies in a massive planter.<br><br>"It's just my phone, Mrs. Harcourt," Gracie assured her. "It's probably Jason...hello?" she gasped.<br><br>There was an amused pause. "Don't tell me," came a deep, drawling, masculine voice. "You're up to your neck in dirt and now your pocket and your cell phone are smeared with it."<br><br>She laughed in spite of her frustration. Her stepbrother knew her better than anyone else on earth. "Yes," she admitted.<br><br>"I'd be cussing."<br><br>"I did say 'darn,'" she replied.<br><br>He sighed. "I'll have to take you in hand, Gracie. Sometimes the situation calls for something more elegant and descriptive than 'darn.'"<br><br>"You'd know," she retorted, recalling that he cursed eloquently in two languages, "especially when one of your cowboys does something you don't like." She frowned. "Where are you?"<br><br>"At the ranch," he said.<br><br>The ranch was his property in Comanche Wells, where he ran purebred Santa Gertrudis cattle and a new equally purebred Japanese breed that was the basis for the famous Kobe beef. Jason Pendleton had millions, but he rarely stayed in the family mansion in San Antonio, where Gracie spent most of her time. Jason was only here when business required it, but his heart was on his huge Santa Gertrudis ranch. He lived there most of the year.He could wheel and deal with the international business set, chair board meetings, run huge corporations and throw incredible parties, with Gracie's help as a hostess. But he was most at home in jeans and boots and chaps, working cattle.<br><br>"Why are you calling me?" she asked. "Do you need somebody to come help you brand cattle?" she teased, because he'd taught her to do that&#x2014;and many other things&#x2014;over the years. She was as much at home on the ranch as he was.<br><br>"Wrong season," he replied. "We drop calves in the spring. It's late August. Almost autumn."<br><br>She frowned. "Then what are you doing?"<br><br>"Rounding up bulls, mostly. But right now I'm getting ready to come up to the auction barn in San Antonio for a sale," he said. "They've got some open Santa Gert heifers I want," he added, referring to the purebred native Texas Santa Gertrudis breed that was founded on the world famous King Ranch near the Texas coast. "Replacement heifers to breed so they'll drop calves next spring."<br><br>"Oh." She tried to remember what that meant.<br><br>He sighed loudly. "Open heifers are young cows that haven't been bred for the first time," he explained again. "They're replacements for cows I've had to cull from the herd and sell off because they didn't produce calves this year."<br><br>"Sorry," she murmured, not wanting to emphasize her memory problems. She forgot things, she plunged down steps, she lost her balance in the most unexpected places. There was a physical reason for those lapses, one which she'd never shared with Jason, not since she and her mother had moved in with him and his father almost twelve years ago. Her mother had been frantic about keeping the past secret, swearing Gracie to silence. Cynthia Marsh had even told everyone that Graciela was her stepdaughter, not her real daughter, to make sure any background checks on Graciela didn't turn up information on her daughter, herself and her late husband that would damage Graciela's place in the Pendleton family. Graciela's father, a widower with a young daughter, had died in the Gulf War, Cynthia emphasized again and again. He was a war hero. It wasn't the truth, of course. The truth was more traumatic.<br><br>"One day you'll get the hang of it," he said easily. He was patient with her, as some people in her life hadn't been.<br><br>"Why are you calling me, if you don't need an extra ranch hand?" she asked merrily.<br><br>"I thought you might like to go to the sale with me," he said comfortably. "I'll buy you lunch after we're through."<br><br>She grinned. "I'd love to," she said.<br><br>Not only did she enjoy his company, but she loved the atmosphere of the sale barn. It was always crowded, always fun. She liked hearing the auctioneer's incredibly rapid spiel as he prompted buyers to go higher and higher on prices for the various lots of cattle. She liked the other cattlemen who turned up there, many of them from Comanche Wells, as well as Jacobsville, which was only a few miles from Comanche Wells. There was a select group of environmentally staunch ranchers to which Jason belonged. They raised old grasses that were earth-friendly, they improved the land and provided habitat for wild animals, they used modern methods of feed production that were kind to the ecology, and they were fanatics about the good treatment of their purebred cattle. These cattlemen never used growth hormone and they only used the necessary antibiotics, most particularly those that prevented bovine pulmonary disorder. They didn't use dangerous chemicals to control weeds or pests. Cy Parks had introduced the idea of using predator insects to control many pests. The lack of poisonous substances on plants helped grow more colonies of honey bees, which were essential to pollination of grain and feed crops.<br><br>None of the environmental group of Jacobs County ranchers ran beef cattle; they were all producers of herd sires and champion young bulls, cows and heifers, which they sold for herd improvement. It got them into trouble sometimes with beef producers who wanted a quicker profit. There had been some notable fistfights at cattle conferences in the past. Jason had been involved in one of them. Gracie had gone to bail him out of jail, bursting into laughter when she saw him, disheveled and bloody and grinning like a Cheshire cat as they led him out of the detention cell. He loved a good fight.<br><br>"I said I'll pick you up in about twenty minutes," he repeated, because she hadn't answered him.<br><br>"Okay. What should I wear?"<br><br>"Jeans and a T-shirt," he said. "If we walk in wearing designer clothes, the price will jump twenty dollars a head before I sit down. I don't want to be recognized."<br><br>"Fat chance if we show up in your Jaguar," she drawled.<br><br>"I'm driving one of the ranch pickups and wearing working clothes," he drawled back.<br><br>"All right. I'll finish cleaning out my flower beds later."<br><br>"As if we haven't already got enough damned bulbs poking up in the front yard. You're getting soil ready to put out more this fall, aren't you?" he muttered. "And I'll bet you've got Harcourt refilling those planters on the porch."<br><br>He knew her too well. "It's just pansies&#x2014;they'll last until late autumn. I won't plant bulbs until October. But bulbs are beautiful in the spring, Jason," she defended herself.<br><br>"Why do I pay a yard man to do outdoor work?" he grumbled.<br><br>"Because he does the heavy work that Harcourt and I can't," she replied saucily. "I'm hanging up now."<br><br>"Don't keep me waiting," he said. "We'll barely make it there in time, as it is. I got held up with an accident."<br><br>"You weren't hurt?" she exclaimed quickly.<br><br>There was a slight pause. "No," he said softly. "Not me. One of my cowboys got stepped on by a bull. Broke his foot, but he'll be all right."<br><br>She let out the breath she'd been holding. Jason was her life. He didn't know how she felt about him. It was impossible anyway. She could never do those things with men that most modern women did. She remembered her mother coming out of the bedroom, the blood staining her nightgown...<br><br>She grimaced. "I thought you just hired a new man to go to local sales representing the ranch to buy cattle for you."<br><br>"I did. But I've heard some things about him I don't like. He's supposed to be at this auction. I can see for myself."<br><br>"He'll recognize you."<br><br>"In my working clothes? Fat chance! Besides, he's only seen me once, behind a desk."<br><br>"Suit yourself. I'll be ready."<br><br>"Better be, or I'll dress you myself," he warned.<br><br>"Jason!"<br><br>But he'd already hung up.<br><br>She got up, putting aside her trowel. "Mrs. Harcourt, we need to tell Manuel to finish clearing these beds for me," she said as she mounted the steps. "Jason's taking me to a sale."<br><br>"All right, darlin'," the graying old woman said with a smile. She was tall and amply padded, with black eyes and a lovely smile. She'd come to work for the family before Jason was born and was considered part of it. She and the maid, Dilly, and the chauffeur, John, were all part of the family. There was other staff that worked part-time, but the old retainers were full-time.<br><br>Gracie loved living here on the big estate in San Antonio. The staff did go down to the ranch in Comanche Wells occasionally for a few weeks, especially when Jason had company down there. If he did, though, it wasn't the same local society crowd he invited to the San Antonio mansion. It was often world leaders who needed a break from the backbreaking pressure of their daily lives, high government politicians running from scandals, even an occasional billionaire who wanted privacy even for a few days. Jason chose his friends by their character, not their wealth. It was one of many things Gracie loved about him. He had a big heart and he was a soft touch for people down on their luck. He gave heavily to charities. But he didn't seem the sort of man who could be approached.<br><br>He was an introvert. It was hard for him to connect to people. Consequently he was intimidating to a lot of guests, who found him hard going in private conversations. Only with Gracie could he relax and be himself. It was, she considered, a matter of trust. He felt safe with her, as she did with him.<br><br>What a pity, said her friend Barbara, who ran a caf� in Jacobsville, that Jason and Gracie were brother and sister, when they had so much in common. Gracie had reminded her that there was no blood relationship there. Jason's father had married Gracie's mother, who was killed only a couple of weeks after the wedding in an automobile accident. Myron Pendleton had kept Gracie, who had no other living relatives, and soon gave her another stepsister, Gloryanne Barnes&#x2014;now Mrs. Rodrigo Ramirez&#x2014;when he married Glory's mother, Beverly, months later. Glory and Gracie had more in common than anyone else knew. They were best friends. It was the two of them against the world when they were in school, because both had scars from their childhoods and neither was comfortable with boys. They rarely dated. They were targets of some vicious bullying, which Jason had quietly and efficiently nipped in the bud. Even today, Glory was still the closest thing to a sister Gracie had ever had.<br><br>She showered and dried her hair, dressing in jeans with a vine of pink roses embroidered down one leg, with a pink T-shirt. Impulsively she brushed out her long, pale blond hair and braided it into pigtails. She grinned at herself with twinkling gray eyes. She had a soft complexion with radiant smoothness. She wasn't beautiful, but she was pretty, in her shy way. She frowned, wondering if it was appropriate to wear pigtails at her age. Sometimes she did things that seemed odd to other people. That little glitch in her brain did a lot of damage to her ego, from time to time.<br><br>Well, it was too late to worry about it now. She put on her fanny pack and pulled on her boots over thick socks. A horn was blowing outside the front door. Jason, impatient as always.<br><br>She ran down the staircase, almost stumbling head over heels, remembered that she'd left her cell phone in her room. She hesitated. What the heck, Jason had his. She continued down the stairs and out the front door.<br><br>"I'll be out for lunch!" she yelled.<br><br>"All right, dear," Mrs. Harcourt called back.<br><br>Jason was tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. He glowered as she quickly descended the front steps of the elegant brick mansion and hurried down the paved walkway to the circular driveway where his big black ranch truck was waiting with the door open.<br><br>She tumbled in beside him and slammed the door.<br><br>"I know, I know, I'm late, but I had to have a shower," she rationalized as she fumbled with her seat belt. "I couldn't go out with dirt on my hair!"<br><br>He glanced at her from under the wide brim of his creamy Stetson. He didn't smile, but his black eyes did.<br><br>He was wearing jeans, too, with wide leather batwing chaps, old disreputable brown boots with turned-up toes from too many soakings and stains everywhere. His shirt was chambray and faded. Despite the immaculate cleanness of his beautiful, tanned hands, he looked like a poor, working cowboy.<br><br>Heavens, he was sexy, she thought as she gave him a covert appraisal. Tall and broad-shouldered, with that physique rarely seen outside a Hollywood Western film, jet-black hair in a conventional short cut, and a light olive complexion that was a legacy, like his black eyes, from a Spanish grandfather. He wasn't conventionally handsome, but he had a very masculine face, lean and square-jawed, with deep-set eyes and high cheekbones and a mouth that was so sensuous it made Gracie squirm. He'd never kissed her. Well, not in the way a man would kiss a woman, anyway. They didn't have that sort of relationship. Nor was he a womanizer. He had women, certainly, she was sure. But he never brought them home.<br><br>"Deep thoughts, tidbit?" he teased, grinning at her with perfect white teeth.<br><br>"I was thinking how handsome you are," she blurted out and then flushed and laughed nervously. "Sorry. My mouth and my brain are disconnected."<br><br>He didn't smile. His black eyes slid over her face and back to the road. "You aren't bad yourself, kid."<br><br>She toyed with her seat belt. "Are any of the Jacobs-ville crowd coming up for this sale?"<br><br>"Cy Parks, J. D. Langley and Leo Hart," he said. "The Harts are after another one of those Japanese bulls grown for Kobe beef. They're moving into new breeding programs."<br><br>"Don't tell me Leo's gone off Salers bulls?" she exclaimed.<br><br>He laughed. "Not completely. But when you consider how well Japanese beef sells, it's no surprise. It's tender and lean and appeals to shoppers. We're in a consumer-driven market war, grubbing for new methods of production and new marketing techniques to overcome the slump in sales."<br><br>"Don't you still chair a committee on marketing with the cattlemen's association?"<br><br>"I did. Had to give it up. This damned German business is wearing me ragged."</p><h2>The Baptism With the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In clear and simple language Torrey teaches what the baptism with the Holy Spirit is and what it does, its necessity for the believer, how this experience can be obtained, the need for re-filling with the Holy Spirit, and how spiritual power can be lost.

This logic extends far beyond the realm of computer science and into the wide and entertaining world of puzzles. In <em>Algorithmic Puzzles</em>, Anany and Maria Levitin use many classic brainteasers as well as newer examples from job interviews with major corporations to show readers how to apply analytical thinking to solve puzzles requiring well-defined procedures.<br>The book's unique collection of puzzles is supplemented with carefully developed tutorials on algorithm design strategies and analysis techniques intended to walk the reader step-by-step through the various approaches to algorithmic problem solving. Mastery of these strategies--exhaustive search, backtracking, and divide-and-conquer, among others--will aid the reader in solving not only the puzzles contained in this book, but also others encountered in interviews, puzzle collections, and throughout everyday life. Each of the 150 puzzles contains hints and solutions, along with commentary on the puzzle's origins and solution methods. <br>The only book of its kind, <em>Algorithmic Puzzles</em> houses puzzles for all skill levels. Readers with only middle school mathematics will develop their algorithmic problem-solving skills through puzzles at the elementary level, while seasoned puzzle solvers will enjoy the challenge of thinking through more difficult puzzles.<br></p><p><br>Anany Levitin is a professor of Computing Sciences at Villanova University. He is the author of a popular textbook on design and analysis of algorithms, which has been translated into Chinese, Greek, Korean, and Russian. He has also published papers on mathematical optimization theory, software engineering, data management, algorithm design, and computer science education.<br>Maria Levitin is an independent consultant. After some years working for leading software companies and developing business applications for large corporations, she now specializes in web-based applications and wireless computing.<br><br>"<em>Algorithmic Puzzles</em> by Anany Levitin and Maria Levitin is an interesting and novel style of puzzle book. The emphasis lies in training the reader to think algorithmically and develop new puzzle-solving skills: the majority of puzzles are problems where we are asked to find the shortest distance or the fewest moves to get from A to B, or construct a proof that a puzzle has no solution. the book provides plenty of puzzles to keep even the most avid problem-solvers busy for a long time, all with varying levels of difficulty and different styles/contexts. The solutions provided are comprehensive and explain themselves in a friendly, constructive manner, complete with illustrations. In addition to questions and answers, a section of brief hints is also provided to assist the reader in their puzzle-solving endeavours." -- Graham Wheeler, <em>Significance</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Law of Nations</h2><p><p>The great eighteenth-century theorist of international law Emer de Vattel (1714 1767) was a key figure in sustaining the practical and theoretical influence of natural jurisprudence through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. Coming toward the end of the period when the discourse of natural law was dominant in European political theory, Vattel&#x2019;s contribution is cited as a major source of contemporary wisdom on questions of international law in the American Revolution and even by opponents of revolution, such as Cardinal Consalvi, at the Congress of Vienna of 1815.</p> <p>Vattel broadly accepted the early-modern natural law theorists from Grotius onward but placed himself in the tradition of Leibniz and Christian Wolff. This becomes particularly clear in two valuable early essays that have never before been translated and are included in the present volume. On this philosophical basis he established what the proper relationship should be between natural law as it is applied to individuals and natural law as it is applied to states.</p> <p>The significance of <i><b>The Law of Nations</b></i> resides in its distillation from natural law of an apt model for international conduct of state affairs that carried conviction in both the Old Regime and the new political order of 1789 1815.</p> <p>The Liberty Fund edition is based on the anonymous English translation of 1797, which includes Vattel&#x2019;s notes for the second French edition (posthumous, 1773).</p> <p><b>Emer de Vattel</b> (1714 1767) was a Swiss philosopher and jurist in the service of Saxony.</p> <p><b>B�la Kapossy</b> is Professeur Suppl�ant of History at the University of Lausanne.</p> <p><b>Richard Whatmore</b> is a Reader in Intellectual History at the University of Sussex.</p> <p><b>Knud Haakonssen</b> is Professor of Intellectual History at the University of Sussex, England.</p></p><p>Bela Kapossy is Professor in Modern History at the University of Lausanne. <br> <br>RICHARD WHATMORE is Reader in Intellectual History and Head of History Department at the University of Sussex.

(Nancy Boyd-Franklin, PhD, Distinguished Professor, Rutgers University; Author of <i>Black Families in Therapy: Understanding the African American Experience</i>)<br><br>"Dr. Shalonda Kelly brings a fresh perspective on diversity to the treatment of families and couples. Structural oppression is an overarching concept, different for each group, but pernicious nevertheless, in its effects on people engendered through stereotypes, intergenerational trauma, discrimination, and disparities. Building on earlier approaches calling attention to therapist self-awareness and knowledge, this book introduces and emphasizes a process approach to cultural competence which focuses on interactional processes&#x2015;going beyond the therapist-client dyad to the exchange among families, couples, and therapists. It is how the complexity of social identities and their intersection influence the therapeutic process that needs attention. Shared history and experiences related to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, and religion are all in the room. Hence, the concept of dynamic sizing&#x2015;the ability to be flexible in individualizing knowledge of a client underscores the important balance between knowing the client and generalizing cultural-specific knowledge and worldviews of the group to which the client belongs. It is a book worth reading with key concepts and practical tools for culturally competent practice."

It shows how the doctrine is rarely used by the Supreme Court, but is employed by academics, pundits and judges to maintain the mistaken faith that the Court decides cases under the law instead of the Justices&#39; personal values. Tracing the development of the doctrine from the founding to present day, Eric J. Segall shows how originalism is used by judges as a pretext for reaching politically desirable results. The book also presents an accurate description and evaluation of the late Justice Scalia&#39;s jurisprudence and shows how he failed to practice the originalism method that he preached. This illuminating work will be of interest to lawyers, law students, undergraduates studying the Court, law professors and anyone else interested in an honest discussion and evaluation of originalism as a theory of constitutional interpretation, a political weapon, and an article of faith.</p><p>Originalism as Faith shows how originalism is often used by judges as a pretext for reaching politically desirable results.

Both believed that a relationship can continue beyond this life, and here Cynthia Bourgeault describes her search for that connection before and after Robin's death. Bourgeault's previous books include <i>The Wisdom Jesus</i> and <i>Centering Prayer and Inner Awakening</i>.<br></p></p><p>Reverend Cynthia Bourgeault was a 50-year-old priest when she met her soul mate, a hermit named Brother Raphael Robin (Rafe). They had only three years on earth together before Rafe died suddenly of a heart attack. Accounts of these earthly days together are as intense and emotionally wrenching as any love affair could be. And yet their relationship was always graced with a higher goal--creating spiritual love over romantic possession. After Rafe died, Bourgeault was content to let him rest in peace as she began her journey of grief. But weeping outdoors on a snowy night, she felt certain that Rafe's spirit was beside her. "Although I was still crying, the emotional sting started to lose its force, and a new and tingling presence began to work its way up in me, literally starting from the tips of my toes," she recalls. "I knew in that moment I was sustained by an invisible and intensely joyous partner." From then on, Bourgeault continued her love affair with Rafe. Building on this unusual, interactive love-after-death experience, Reverend Bourgeault has assembled some exquisitely reassuring thoughts and anecdotes on eternal love and the impermanence of death. This memoir could be inspirational for grieving lovers or anyone who wants to further explore the mysteries of love, death, spirit, and reincarnation. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>I've always harbored a healthy skepticism about connections with those who have departed this life, since I felt that, surely, they would now have better things to do (or perhaps not do) than stay in touch with us. However, as soon as I read Cynthia Bourgeault's account of her electrifying meeting with Brother Raphael Robin and what ensued in the three years they spent together, and then transpired after his death, I was converted. This is a love story like no other. And it is instructive for other people who feel joined to their loved ones for all eternity and yet have no model for how to stay in touch.<br><br>The world has had an increasing number of accounts recently of what happens beyond the grave but this is the first one to my knowledge that comes out of the Church and, as such, it is sure to be controversial. Still, the Reverend Bourgeault is a medieval scholar and she has done her homework well. Her book is theologically sound, as Brother David Steindl-Rast points out in his amazing foreword, "Its spirituality, far from violating monastic tradition, pushes the understanding of traditional values higher and deeper."<br>-- Toinette Lippe, editorial director of Bell Tower.</p><h2>Selected Duets for French Horn: Volume 1 - Easy to Medium (Rubank Educational Library)</h2><p>(Ensemble Collection).

In fact I had prided myself on mine. I credited it with alerting me to danger more than once during my career as an investigator. So I can&#x2019;t explain why it let me down on such a critical occasion, when an advance warning might have spared us all such grief. Maybe the perpetrator of this evil had not planned it in advance. Maybe it had been a last-minute order from above, so I had not been able to sense his intention or his presence&nbsp;&#x2026; or their presence. I&#x2019;m sure there must have been more than one of them. That was how they worked. <br>Anyway, there were certainly no uneasy thoughts in my head that bright May morning as I fed my little one his breakfast. He was eight months old now, a strapping boy with a shock of dark curls like his father and an impish smile. Now I think back on it I wonder if Aggie hadn&#x2019;t been the one with the sixth sense, although she had no Celtic connections that I knew of. She came into the kitchen while I was feeding Liam, bearing two letters in her hand. <br>&#x201c;Mail just arrived, Mrs. Sullivan,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Two letters for you. One with a foreign stamp.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That will be from my friends in Paris, I expect,&#x201d; I said, taking them from her. &#x201c;How nice.&#x201d; <br>I took in Sid&#x2019;s bold black script on the foreign envelope and noted that the other was my mother-in-law&#x2019;s weekly missive. The former would wait until I had the proper time to savor Sid&#x2019;s latest account of their adventures in Paris. The latter could simply wait. <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to read them?&#x201d; Aggie hovered at my shoulder, still fascinated by the foreign look of the envelope. <br>&#x201c;Later, when I have time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If anyone ever wrote to me, I&#x2019;d want to read it right away,&#x201d; she said wistfully. Then she shivered and wrapped her arms around her scrawny body. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful cold in here today, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Cold for May.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is it? I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d; I looked out of the window where early roses were climbing up a trellis. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a nice bright day. You can come with me when I take Liam for his walk and you&#x2019;ll feel warmer in the sun.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I need to be getting on with the laundry,&#x201d; she said, eyeing Liam, who now had a generous amount of cream of wheat over his front. &#x201c;That child gets through more clothes than a little prince and I expect I&#x2019;ll warm myself up scrubbing away at the washboard.&#x201d; <br>She stood there, still hugging her arms to her skinny body. Although she had been with me since Liam was born, and had an appetite like a horse, there wasn&#x2019;t an ounce of flesh on her and she still looked like a pathetic little waif. I had taken her in out of pity, after she had been forced to give up the child she had had out of wedlock, but she had surprised me by being a hard worker and wonderful with the baby. She&#x2019;d been the oldest of ten and had grown up taking care of the younger ones&#x2014;a valuable asset to her family, but that hadn&#x2019;t stopped her parents from throwing her out the moment they learned she was pregnant. She was pathetically grateful to come to us and I in turn was grateful for her knowledge in those first difficult weeks with the new baby. <br>&#x201c;The laundry will wait,&#x201d; I said, smiling at her. &#x201c;Come on, get Liam changed out of those messy clothes and we&#x2019;ll go out.&#x201d; <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;No, Mrs. Sullivan. I think I&#x2019;d better stay and get those diapers out on the line, if you don&#x2019;t mind. A morning like this is too bright to last. There will be rain by the end of the day, you mark my words.&#x201d; <br>She had grown up on a farm in the Adirondacks so I believed her. &#x201c;All the more reason for me to give Liam his daily dose of fresh air,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a gloomy spring so far, hasn&#x2019;t it? I was beginning to think summer would never come.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been gloomy enough around here,&#x201d; Aggie said, &#x201c;with Captain Sullivan going around with a face that would curdle milk and hardly a civil word in his head.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not for you to criticize your employer,&#x201d; I said sharply and watched her flinch as if I&#x2019;d slapped her. Then I relented, of course. &#x201c;Captain Sullivan is under a great deal of worry at the moment. A policeman&#x2019;s job is never the easiest and right now I think he&#x2019;s battling a major problem. Not that he ever confides in me, but if his current bad temper is anything to go on, then I&#x2019;d say he had a particularly difficult case on his hands. It&#x2019;s our job to make sure his life is as pleasant as possible when he comes home.&#x201d; <br>She nodded silently as she lifted Liam out of his high chair and bore him away up the stairs. I cleaned away the aftermath of Liam&#x2019;s breakfast and considered my little speech. I realized it had been a pep talk for me as well as Aggie, because I had found Daniel&#x2019;s current black mood hard to take. More than once I&#x2019;d wondered why I ever thought that it had been a good idea to leave my life of freedom and independence as a private investigator to get married. I think I&#x2019;d expected to be able to share in his work, mulling over complicated cases with him and giving him the benefit of my own experience as a detective. But that hadn&#x2019;t happened. Daniel remained tight-lipped about his work. He was gone from morning till night most days and only popped in for a hasty meal. A quick peck on the cheek as he ran out of the door again was the best I could hope for. <i>For better or worse</i> rang through my head. That was what I&#x2019;d promised at the altar. I sighed and put the dishes in the sink for Aggie. Then I went up to my room to change my clothes. A walk in the sunshine would soon do wonders for my current mood. <br>Aggie was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs with Liam already strapped in his buggy. &#x201c;You could take those letters with you to read,&#x201d; she said, handing them to me. <br>I laughed. &#x201c;I believe you&#x2019;re more interested in my mail than I am.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I love hearing about foreign parts,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a fairy tale.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll read Miss Goldfarb&#x2019;s letter to you later if you like,&#x201d; I said. Aggie hadn&#x2019;t yet managed to learn to read, in spite of my efforts to teach her. I put on my hat, adjusting it in front of the hall mirror, then Aggie helped me maneuver the buggy down the front steps. <br>&#x201c;I hope you have a nice walk, Mrs. Sullivan,&#x201d; she called after me as I set off. <br>I almost asked her again to come with us, but I reminded myself that she was the servant and the laundry was her job. I&#x2019;d bring her a cake for tea, I decided. She loved the cakes I brought from the French bakery around the corner. As Liam and I bumped over the cobbles of Patchin Place I couldn&#x2019;t help glancing across at the doorway of number 9. It had been two months now since my friends Elena Goldfarb and Augusta Walcott, more familiarly known as Sid and Gus, had taken it into their heads to go to Paris, so that Gus could study art with the best painters of the day. I had never thought that Gus&#x2019;s talent for painting was as great as she believed it to be, but her cousin Willie Walcott had gone to study in Paris and was now apparently making a name for himself as a painter of the Impressionist school. He had promised introductions for Sid and Gus. <br>From their letters they seemed to be having a roaring good time, while I missed them terribly. I had come to count on their comforting presence across the street, their extravagant parties, and their bohemian lifestyle that Daniel only just tolerated for my sake. With Sid and Gus, life was never boring. You never knew when you&#x2019;d open their front door and find the front parlor turned into a Mongolian yurt or a Turkish harem. They never had to worry about the day-to-day trivialities of normal life. They had enough money to live as they wanted, according to their rules. This is not to say that they were always frivolous. They were keen supporters of the suffrage movement and I missed attending those meetings at their house as well. <br>I sighed as I came out onto Greenwich Avenue and steered Liam&#x2019;s buggy around a pile of steaming horse droppings. Ah, well. They&#x2019;d grow tired of Paris and come home eventually, wouldn&#x2019;t they? And in the meantime I had a husband to look after and a son to raise. Things could be worse. Liam leaned forward in the buggy, urging me to go faster, and babbled in delight when an automobile drove past us, its driver&#x2019;s long scarf streaming out in the breeze behind him as he steered the contraption around a slow moving dray. <i>Just like his father,</i> I thought, smiling at his excitement. We were seeing more and more automobiles these days. I know Daniel secretly hankered after one. He was allowed to drive the police vehicle when there was a special need, but that didn&#x2019;t include giving his family a ride. <br>I waited for a gap in the traffic before I pushed the buggy across into Washington Square, passing beneath the great arch and into the relative tranquility of the gardens beyond. Here activity was confined to mothers pushing buggies while toddlers clung to their skirts, bigger boys bowling iron hoops that rattled over the gravel paths, and even bigger boys playing a game of kick the can. I wondered why the latter weren&#x2019;t in school as it certainly wasn&#x2019;t a holiday. I suppose they could have been newsboys, taking a break from long hours standing on street corners. <br>I found a bench in the sun and turned the buggy so that Liam could watch the bigger children at play. He seemed more fascinated with the fountain in the center of the square and a flock of small birds that perched on the lip, daring each other to take a bath in the spray that flew out in the breeze. <br>With my son content for the moment I opened my letters. I dutifully read Daniel&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s letter first, as he&#x2019;d no doubt want a report on her doings and she&#x2019;d no doubt want a reply from me. Usually her weekly letters were a recital of what she had done around the house, what her young charge Bridie was doing, interspersed with slivers of local gossip. But today I was surprised to read, <i>By the time you read this I shall be gone.</i> <br>My heart lurched in my chest. I have to confess that I wasn&#x2019;t overly fond of Daniel&#x2019;s mother, but this was so sudden. Then I read on. <br> <i>I am writing this in haste to let you know that I am about to embark on a journey. I decided not to mention this plan to you in advance as I rather think that Daniel might have tried to dissuade me. And I don&#x2019;t think it would have taken that much to dissuade me since it was such a huge undertaking for me.</i> <br> <i>You remember my friend Letitia Blackstone? Her daughter Imogen married a young engineer who is now designing a bridge across the Mississippi River. Letitia wanted to visit her daughter who has just had a baby, but was reluctant to travel alone to such wild and barbaric parts. So she asked me if I would accompany her if she paid my way. Of course I agreed. What an adventure at my time of life to see a little more of our beautiful country before I die. And Letitia insists on doing everything first class so I don&#x2019;t expect it will be too uncomfortable or dangerous. It will also be a perfect opportunity for young Bridie. I&#x2019;m taking her along as my companion as she&#x2019;s been worried recently about her papa and this will take her mind off things.</i> <br>I stopped reading and stared out across the square. Poor little Bridie, whose father and brother had gone down to Panama to work on the building of the canal. None of the news that came from that hellhole had been good. Men had been dropping like flies, so it was said, from yellow fever and terrible working conditions. And there had been no news from Bridie&#x2019;s father for months so we had to assume the worst. <br>I read on. Martha the maid was to visit her ailing mother. The house was to be shut up and Mrs. Sullivan didn&#x2019;t know how long they would be away. She sent her warmest regards and a fond kiss to her grandchild. I folded the letter and put it back in its envelope. Well, that would be a surprise for Daniel. His mother was not the kind one would expect to make rash, last-minute decisions to go out into the wild west. <br>I glanced across at Liam and saw that he had fallen asleep. I adjusted his pillows, covered him properly and then turned to my other letter. It was as I expected, full of exciting tidbits of news of life in Paris. Sid wrote: <br> <i>Willie has obtained an introduction for Gus to none other than Reynold Bryce. You know who he is, don&#x2019;t you, Molly? He made a name for himself as part of the Boston School back in the eighties&#x2014;particularly with his paintings of the young girl he called Angela. Then at the height of his fame he took off for Paris and has remained here, becoming one of the leading lights among Impressionist painters. Anyway, he is THE patron and lodestone for American artists in Paris. His salon is where one needs to be seen. He holds an exhibition every spring and if he includes your work, you are IN! Gus is hoping he&#x2019;ll include her, naturally. She&#x2019;s been painting some really interesting canvasses recently, although I think she may be a little avant-garde for traditionalists like Reynold Bryce. Gus says she&#x2019;s not sure whether she&#x2019;s a Fauvist, a Cubist, or simply a modernist, but she&#x2019;s thrilled to be among artists who dare to paint with her boldness. We met a rather dashing young Spaniard in a bar. His name is Pablo Picasso and he said that Gus&#x2019;s work shows promise. I&#x2019;m not sure I can say the same about his daubings&#x2014;most odd.</i> <br> <i>Speaking of young painters, we have just made an astounding discovery. Remember it was Gus&#x2019;s cousin who lured us to Paris in the first place. Well, it turns out that I have a relative here as well&#x2014;a distant cousin. When we were about to leave for Paris my mother told me that we had family members who had settled there when the family left the turmoils in Eastern Europe. My grandfather came to America and my great-uncle&#x2019;s family went to Paris. Mama had no current address for them but their last name would have been Goldfarb like ours. I asked at several synagogues but to no avail&#x2014;in fact the Parisian Jews did not exactly extend the welcome mat. Well, I admit that I do not look like the good traditional Jewish woman, nor do I practice my religion, but it turned out that the cause of their caution had more to do with the current wave of anti-Semitism that has swept this city, culminating in the dreadful treatment of Captain Dreyfus&#x2014;falsely imprisoned and shipped to Devil&#x2019;s Island mainly because of his race.</i> <br> <i>Having heard this, we&#x2019;re not sure how long we&#x2019;ll stay, though of course among the more bohemian community of artists and writers, race, gender, or even appearance don&#x2019;t matter a fig. Talent is all that counts. You&#x2019;ll be amazed to learn that I was the first of us to have a talent acknowledged here. We went to a soiree and were each instructed to write a poem. I read mine with great trepidation but it was pronounced good. At this gathering I was instantly drawn to a young man with an interesting face and such soulful dark eyes&#x2014;clearly also Jewish. We started to share information about our ancestry and lo and behold he turned out to be my long-lost distant cousin, Maxim Noah. Apparently his mother was a Goldfarb. His parents are dead, and he lives in a studio with artist friends up on the hill called Montmartre. And the poets I met have invited me to join their group. It seems that in this city poetry is as important as painting. Did you ever imagine that such a place could exist on earth? If it weren&#x2019;t for the anti-Semitic sentiment and for missing our delightful godson Liam, we might never want to come home!</i> <br> <i>But I digress. As I mentioned, Maxim lives with some other young artists up in the rural part of Montmartre and invited us to visit him. &#x201c;Primitive&#x201d; is hardly the word to describe it, my dear. No heat, no running water, just a group of young men painting, creating, disc...</i></p><h2>God of War II</h2><p><b>All the majesty and mayhem of Greek mythology springs to life once more in the powerful second novel based on the bestselling and critically acclaimed God of War� franchise.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Once the mighty warrior Kratos was a slave to the gods, bound to do their savage bidding. After destroying Ares, the God of War, Kratos was granted his freedom by Zeus&#x2014;and even given the ousted god&#x2019;s throne on Olympus.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the other gods of the pantheon didn&#x2019;t take kindly to Kratos&#x2019;s ascension and, in turn, conspired against him. Banished, Kratos must ally himself with the despised Titans, ancient enemies of the Olympians, in order to take revenge and silence the nightmares that haunt him.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>God of War II</i> takes the videogame&#x2019;s action to electrifying new heights, and adds ever more fascinating layers to the larger-than-life tale of Kratos.</p><p><b>Robert E. Vardeman</b> is a veteran science fiction, fantasy, and media tie-in writer. He is celebrated for his original fiction as well as his licensed fiction, including several <i>Star Trek</i> novels. He also collaborated with Matt Stover on the first <i>God of War</i> novel.Chapter One<br><br>&#x201c;My love,&#x201d; came the soft, urgent whisper. &#x201c;I want you!&#x201d;<br><br>Kratos, the God of War, stirred, moaned, and reached out. The beloved name Lysandra formed on his lips. He sat up and looked about the small, firelit chamber. The scent of burning elder wood permeated the room. A fleecy soft lamb&#x2019;s-�wool blanket had been spread, two goblets of wine nearby. It was perfect for a romantic moment with his wife.<br><br>&#x201c;Lysandra,&#x201d; he said, louder. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here, my love. You have come home from battle to me. I have missed you so!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I have missed you,&#x201d; he said, somehow not moving yet crossing the room and taking her into his arms. He held her close, feeling her vitality, the warmth of her body, aroused by the way she moved sensuously against his muscular frame.<br><br>&#x201c;Promise you will never leave me again. I cannot bear to lose you, even for a brief moment.&#x201d;<br><br>Kratos sucked in his breath. His wife&#x2019;s scent dilated his nostrils and sent his heart to hammering. Her silken hair floated like a cloud, brushing his cheek, soothing the wounds on his face with the lightest touch. But he tried to push her away. Something was wrong. She resisted, her strength greater than his.<br><br>Her body turned cold where once it had been alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Lysandra, what is wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing can be wrong with our love.&#x201d;<br><br>Using his full strength, he succeeded in pushing her from him. Her face was twisted into one of stark terror.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let me go, Kratos. Don&#x2019;t hurt me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hurt you? I would have killed hundreds to protect you. I would die for you!&#x201d;<br><br>He lifted his hand. A sword dripping with blood thrust forward. His hand circled the hilt, slippery with the life fluids of his enemies, but it was not his will directing the thrust. The coppery scent of blood, the sudden gleam of reflected firelight from the blade, the perfect balance and the keen edge and . . .<br><br>. . . and Kratos screamed in agony as he thrust forward, gutting his wife. Lysandra gripped the sword where it penetrated her belly, cutting her fingers on the edge. The blood of his wife mixed with that of warriors he had slain. She looked from the blade spitting her to his shocked face, reached for him, injured fingers red with her own blood. Anguish flooded his senses when he realized what he had done.<br><br>Then the screams of rage and fear were snuffed out. The only sound to be heard was the dripping of his wife&#x2019;s blood to the floor. He jerked away and the sword pulled free from its fleshy berth, sending a gory arc of her blood and organs outward. A bit was flung into the fire, where it sizzled and popped. And then came total silence, except for a singular voice.<br><br>The voice of a small girl.<br><br>&#x201c;Papa, what have you done?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Calliope,&#x201d; he called to his young daughter.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead. You murdered her! How could you?&#x201d; Small fists hammered at his armor. He was clad in full battle gear, and Calliope attacked with the full fury of a frightened, angered child.<br><br>He swung the sword. His muscles bunched as he tried to stay the blow. He could not. The pommel struck his daughter in the temple, knocking her down.<br><br>&#x201c;I did not mean this!&#x201d; Kratos stepped forward, greaves clanking and his body armor grating. The reflection from his sword, the Blades of Chaos attached to the bone of his forearms with cruel chain links, filled his vision and then blinded him.<br><br>Rage exploded when he heard a mocking voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Ares!&#x201d; He shrieked and sought to kill the god with the very blades he had been given to do Ares&#x2019; bidding.<br><br>The swords, one in each hand, slashed out, but it was Calliope and not Ares who died. The little girl perished in a welter of blood and sobs damning him, crying out for her mother now dead also by his hand. And the rage and loss exploded within his brain so that he spun about and saw . . .<br><br>. . . a dark figure.<br><br>&#x201c;Ares? You forced me to kill my own wife and daughter! I will kill you!&#x201d;<br><br>But it was not Ares he faced but a nebulous, black, misty thing.<br><br>&#x201c;Fight me! Fight me, you craven!&#x201d; Kratos dismissed the Blades of Chaos and clutched the Blades of Athena, more powerful than any mortal could ever wield. But he was not a mortal now. He had destroyed Ares and was now the God of War.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know I was killing them. I loved them.<br><br>&#x201c;Lysandra, come back to me, I didn&#x2019;t mean to slay you,&#x201d; Kratos said, seeking to stop the nocturnal torment the only way he knew, but he swung his blades at emptiness. He again stood on a barren plain that stretched flat in all directions. The more he tried to fight, the heavier the swords became, and when his muscles no longer responded, he sank to his knees and bowed his head. Kratos wept.<br><br>And in the distance he heard soft whispers of concern.<br><br>&#x201c;He cries in his sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How is this possible? He is God of War!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He sheds no tears for those he has slain in battle. Perhaps he&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Kratos came awake with a start. It took him long seconds to realize he clutched a lovely woman by the throat. Her slender fingers trying to free herself were no match for his powerful grip. Without realizing he was doing so, he had started to crush the life from her body.<br><br>&#x201c;Please. Lord Kratos, do not kill her,&#x201d; came the impassioned plea from the other side of his large bed. &#x201c;She seeks only to serve you, not offend!&#x201d;<br><br>Kratos released the death grip. The woman he had almost killed fell across his bare legs as she gasped for breath. He sat up and stared at her twitching body. She wore a thin garment of pale green silk that revealed her voluptuous curves. Struggling, she rolled off his legs, clutching her throat. The fiery red marks stood out in bold relief where his fingers had crushed into alabaster skin. Despite the nearness of death, the woman showed no fear of meeting Hades. Kratos read something different there, another emotion that infuriated him.<br><br>Let her be afraid. He was God of War. His enemies cowered before him!<br><br>But she showed pity for him. For him! The Ghost of Sparta!<br><br>&#x201c;The dreams again, my lord? They still torture you? How may I ease your burden?&#x201d; She moved to push away the sheets covering his midsection.<br><br>Her hot breath touched his belly and lower. Then there were two. The other concubine, the one who had begged for him to release the death grip, sought to give him pleasure, also.<br><br>&#x201c;Away,&#x201d; he roared. &#x201c;Get away from me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We seek only your comfort, Lord Kratos. We want to do whatever we can to soothe your troubles&#x2014;�and to replace them with delight. Let us do Aphrodite&#x2019;s bidding and&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Kratos swung his brawny forearm and sent both women tumbling away. They muttered to themselves. He stood, thin vestiges of his dream fading quickly until he found it difficult to remember exactly what had happened. A black plain. A cave that became a mountain and then something else. His head threatened to explode from trying to remember that encounter.<br><br>But he had no trouble remembering the feel of his sword driving into Lysandra&#x2019;s body or the terror and loathing on his own sweet Calliope&#x2019;s face as he killed her, also. The nightmares were as permanent as the sky and earth and the Olympian throne on which Zeus sat.<br><br>&#x201c;You promised to obliterate my nightmares if I did your bidding,&#x201d; Kratos said, shaking his fist at the open sky above his sleeping chamber. &#x201c;You lied, Zeus. You lied!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Master, please. We seek only to do your bidding. Tell us how!&#x201d; The two women threw themselves at his feet. He kicked them away, went to the table where his armor was laid out with his simple clothing, clothing befitting a warrior, and quickly dressed. When the women came to aid him in his toilet, he drove them back with a dark glare. They huddled together, watching him.<br><br>He felt pity radiating from them like heat from the sun itself. He hated them for that. He hated himself all the more for ever believing Zeus. With a final jerk, he strapped on his armor and settled two swords in an X pattern across his back.<br><br>Kratos stormed from his sleeping chamber.<br><br>Massive shoulders rippling under his chased-�gold armor, nicked in places from terrible battles fought and won, he used both hands to throw open the fifty-�foot-�tall doors leading from his chambers. The huge stone doors sent echoes reverberating throughout Olympus. As he strode along he never noticed the fine vases, the tapestries on the marble walls, the myriad tributes collected by the gods of Olympus from their mortal worshippers; instead he plotted and planned. These serene halls with clouds floating under terraces opening to the side were not for him.<br><br>He was a warrior.<br><br>He ran his fingers over the bone-�white of his skin. His wife Lysandra&#x2019;s and daughter Calliope&#x2019;s ashes had been cast over him, forever making his flesh an unforgettable symbol of how Ares had betrayed him, tricked him, and led him to murder those he loved above all else. Even the bright red tattoo in memory of his brother Deimos and proclaiming him a soldier of Sparta seemed a mockery.<br><br>Kratos&#x2019; hand flashed to the hilts of the blades at his back when Hermes ran down the corridor, dancing about like some gaudy butterfly. The Messenger of the Gods visibly paled and darted away. Such it was whenever another saw Kratos. Stride lengthening, he passed where other gods gathered in small groups of twos and threes. They turned their backs to him.<br><br>He heard Zeus&#x2019; sister Hestia sniff in contempt and say to Demeter in a voice just loud enough for him to overhear, &#x201c;Has your crop been ruined by his endless war?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My worshippers starve because of him and those terrible, brutish Spartans,&#x201d; Demeter said. She glanced sideways at Kratos, then turned quickly and took Hestia by the arm to guide her away, going in the direction already taken by Hermes.<br><br>Kratos&#x2019; hands slid from the handles, and a sneer curled his lip, twisting his face into pure contempt. What did he need their approval for when he was greater than the lot?<br><br>Swinging about, sandals making slapping sounds on the travertine floor, he went to a huge vaulted atrium dominated by a circular aperture. Within the confines of the circle roiled a thin fog turned the color of blood. Distant sounds of battle heartened Kratos. The clash of sword against sword, shields deflecting blows and knives driving into exposed midriffs, the battle cries of the victorious and the lamentations of the vanquished. Men strove in his name. Armies swept across the face of Greece and laid waste to all they encountered.<br><br>The God of War favored Sparta and incited the warriors to destroy all armies, all cities, every man, woman, and child not of the city of his birth who refused to be subjugated. He had been called the Ghost of Sparta. Now he was God of War with a mighty sword-�wielding army sweeping across the world.<br><br>The shrieks of dying men rose higher; music to his ears. For these were not Spartans dying but other, weaker men. The fog billowed higher and parted to give him a clear view of the battlefield below. A harbor. A city burning. Soldiers driving swords through leather armor into bellies and hearts. Spartan soldiers, invincible because of dedication and training&#x2014;�and his favor. &#x201c; . . . Kratos, how could you kill me? . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The whisper from deep within his nightmares was drowned out as he bellowed his approval when a Spartan unit marched forward, swords clanking against bronze shields. Their feet hit the ground in a marching rhythm that sent tremors of fear through the enemy.<br><br>&#x201c;Allow no escape. Give no quarter!&#x201d; His words filled the air and echoed throughout Olympus and to the world below. The Spartans dulled their blades on the shields and necks, the greaves and arms, of the enemy until the din of battle suffocated any voice in Kratos&#x2019; mind. He continued to direct the carnage, approving of his army&#x2019;s fighting prowess.<br><br>Far below a young Spartan stepped from the fray and thrust his sword high in the air, toward Olympus where Kratos watched.<br><br>&#x201c;My lord Kratos!&#x201d; The words were caught on the din of battle and carried to his ears. &#x201c;Another city is ready to fall! Soon all shall know the glory of Sparta!&#x201d;<br><br>Kratos&#x2019; hands clenched into tight fists, and cords stood out on his forearms and in his neck as he tensed. Victory! He did not need Hermes to bring such glorious news when he could watch his armies from this lofty perch. But Kratos was never one to watch. The sight of skilled warriors battling the ever-�weakening defenders of the harbor city of Rhodes pledged to Apollo told him he would have to hurry if he wanted to share in the blood and glory of victory.<br><br>A soft tread on the stone floor behind caused him to straighten. His quick intake of breath filled his nostrils with the aromatic spikenard. Slowly turning, he faced Athena. The goddess looked up at him with a curious mixture of anger and pleading. Her sepia-�tattooed lips parted, but she did not speak immediately. The intricate, swirling designs on her face seemed to take on a life of their own, as if those tattoos might possess her. But Kratos knew better. Of the gods, Athena was the most in control of herself. Her schemes were clever and subtle and had brought him to Olympus as a god.<br><br>Her elaborately engraved armor creaked slightly as she reached out and placed a hand on his shoulder. He jerked free. His anger built anew.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough, Kratos. The wrath of Olympus grows. Even I will no longer be able to protect you.&#x201d; The delicate golden bands of her head decoration caught sunlight and made her look even more godlike. She wore battle armor, not as a fashion statement like so many other gods but because she was a warrior. He appreciated this and that she had worn the bronze-�and-�leather panoply to show how different she was from so many others who refused to even speak with him, much less confront him. But she was not his ally. She always took the side of Zeus and prattled about what was best for Olympus, as if he should care, too.<br><br>Kratos growled deep in his throat and pushed savagely past the goddess.<br><br>&#x201c;I need no protection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You forget that it was I who made you a god, Kratos. Do not turn your back on me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I owe you nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you leave me no choice.&#x201d;<br><br>He ignored her, his stride long, sure, and directed toward a precipice ahead. The marble floor simply ended to give a dizzying view of the earth far below. Kratos paused a moment, the sounds of battle reaching him even at this great height. He drew in a deep breath and smelled the sharp tang of spilled blood. The battle would be over quickly. He wanted to be there to cheer on the Spartan soldiers&#x2014;�and to relish the victory over yet another city&#x2019;s patron god, whoever that might be. Kratos neither knew nor cared. He stepped forward, fell rigidly at attention, and aimed his head toward the far ground. The wind caught at him as he arrowed downward.<br><br>&#x201c;Kratos, no!&#x201d; came Athena&#x2019;s faint warning.</p><h2>The Story Pirates Present: Quest for the Crystal Crown</h2><p><b><b>A hidden lost world.

The move brought Fella all sorts of comforts she wasn't used to at home, but it also meant saying goodbye to her sister Zoey (a.k.a. Zany) and her other mother, Mama Shannon. Though Mama Shannon fought hard to keep Fella, it was no use. The marriage act is still a few years away and the courts thought Fella would be better off with a blood relation. Already heartbroken, Fella soon finds herself alone in Mrs. Madison's house, grieving both the death of her mother and the loss of her entire family.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Then one night, Zany shows up at Mrs. Madison&#x2019;s house determined to fulfill Mama Lacy&#x2019;s dying wish: to have her ashes spread over the lawn of the last place they were all happy as a family.

In 1872, following a fire, the little bakery became a pastry shop and the decoration was then done by Jules Cheret, a famous painter and poster-designer of the time. Jeanne Souchard, Ernest Ladur�e's wife, then had the idea of combining the Parisian caf� with a pastry-shop. She therefore created one of Paris' first tearooms.</p><p></p><p>In 1993 Ladur�e was bought by Francis and David Holder and became one of the best-known gourmet addresses in Paris, a veritable institution with its famous "macaron" as its emblem. In 1997 Ladur�e opened a tea-room/restaurant on the prestigious Champs-Elys�es, followed by another in the Printemps department store and on the Left Bank as well as the beginning of their international adventure with branches in London, Geneva, Monaco and Tokyo.</p><p></p><p>In this book Michel Lerouet, the Chef at Ladur�e, reveals 100 of the most famous Ladur�e recipes, adapted for the general public.

At the age of 16 he decided to enter a catering school. He did his first internship at the Hotellerie du Grand Lac (1 Michelin star) near the family home and moved up through the ranks. With Guy Savoy he learned rigor, perfection and especially generosity. He put these qualities into practice at Tante Louise where he first became chef and Assistant Manager. At Tante Louise his style took root, his cooking became structured with balanced recipes without excess. He developed this during 5 years at the Procope in Paris. For Ladur�e he gives all of his determination and know-how; he pays careful attention to the quality of the products used and shares the best of himself.

The physical distance is 1,000 miles of difficult-and often treacherous-water, which Raban navigates solo in a 35-foot sailboat.<br><br>But <b>Passage to Juneau</b> also traverses a gulf of centuries and cultures: the immeasurable divide between the Northwest's Indians and its first European explorers-- between its embattled fishermen and loggers and its pampered new class. Along the way, Raban offers captivating discourses on art, philosophy, and navigation and an unsparing narrative of personal loss.</p><p>British-born Jonathan Raban sets out on a passage from Seattle to Juneau in a small boat that is more a waterborne writing den, and as usual with the brilliant Raban, this journey becomes a vehicle for history and heart-stopping descriptions that will make readers want to hail him as one of the finest talents who's picked up a pen in the 20th century. The voyage through the Inside Passage from Washington's Puget Sound to Alaska churns up memories and stirs up hidden emotions and Raban dwells on many, including the death of his father and his own role of Daddy to his young daughter, Julia, left behind in Seattle. More than just a personal travelogue, however, <i>Passage to Juneau</i> deftly weaves in the stories of others before him--from Indians whom white men formerly greeted with baubles set afloat on logs, to Captain Vancouver, who risked mutiny on his ship when he banned visits with prostitutes, some of whom offered their services for bits of scrap metal. Pressed into every page are intimate descriptions of life at sea--the fog-shrouded coasts, the crackly radio that keeps him linked to the mainland, the salty marine air, and the fellow sailors who are likewise drawn by a life of tossing on water. While Raban successfully steers his boat to the desired port, readers ultimately discover that this insightful, talented sage is in fact emotionally in deep water and may not fully be captain of his own life. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i><br>A conversation with Jonathan Raban, author of Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings<br><br>Q: You're a Brit living in America, writing passionately and brilliantly about this country. How did your kinship with the U.S. begin, and how has it evolved from book to book?<br>A: For "kinship" read "bewildered fascination." Oh, it began in infancy, in Norfolk, England in the last days of World War II. There was an American air force base just down the road from where we lived. Americans - larger in every way than the scrawny English after five years of wartime rationing - rode past our house in open armored cars, tossing sticks of gum from their PX , and the village kids scrabbled for them in the dirt. I wasn't a village kid, and to my enormous disappointment, my mother forbade me from joining the melee. But I have made up for that since. First, in my early teens, I was besotted by American rock music - Bill Haley and his Comets, Frankie Lymon, Elvis Presley... Then came American novels. Huckleberry Finn was a childhood favorite, then Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, then, when I was at university, the novels of Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, the young Philip Roth. The poems of Robert Lowell (whom I later came to know). These were liberating influences. Postwar British fiction and poetry seemed terribly dry by comparison to these wonderfully fluent, extravagant Americans. My first job - long before I had set foot in the U.S. - was teaching American literature at the University College of Wales, then at the University of East Anglia. So when I came to visit this country for the first time (in 1972, when I took up a visiting professorship at Smith College, in Northampton, Mass), I had been living in a richly populated imaginary America for a long time. I continue to live in that strange world now. I think that only the reader can judge how it has evolved in my books.<br><br>Q: You've traveled down the Mississippi in a 16-foot boat (Old Glory), roamed from place to place around the country in Hunting Mister Heartbreak, explored eastern Montana and western North Dakota in Bad Land. How do you choose your destinations? Where else in the U.S. would you like to write about?<br>A: Old Glory and Hunting Mister Heartbreak were books written (mostly) from England about a foreign land. But in Bad Land I was trying to write about home, trying to make imaginative sense of the lives of an earlier generation of European immigrants, using their experience to inform mine, and vice-versa. Going to Ismay, Montana wasn't a journey, or a destination, that I chose; it chose me, because my friend, like many people who finally found their way to Seattle, had come from there, and I wanted to borrow his family history for my own. If I could plant my feet in the shoes of his grandparents, and look out through their eyes, I thought I might be able to make better sense of my own situation here... I see Bad Land as the first book in a loose trilogy about living here in the Pacific Northwest; Passage to Juneau continues and elaborates the theme. The third book, a novel, will be set right here, in Seattle.<br><br>Q: Tell us how you came to write Passage to Juneau.<br>A: Bad Land was really a sea-story, about shipwreck, set a thousand miles inland on the dry prairies. Writing it, I came to see that there was another story I wanted to explore, really a land-story set at sea. Since 1990 (when I came to live in Seattle), I had been spending as much time as I could sailing around Washington and British Columbia, mostly on the waters of the Inside Passage, but also venturing out into the open Pacific, off the coast of Vancouver Island. The more I sailed, and sopped up the lore of our tricky local sea, the more I saw that the water here was a "place", as full of intricacy and character as any sweep of land. For the coastal Indians, the surface of the sea was their primary workplace - it was where they fished, fought their wars, traded goods, met their wives and husbands... They had names for every feature of the water - many more names for the sea than they had for the surrounding land. The cedar canoe was their equivalent of the horse and carriage, or the Ford Taurus. To understand the true history of the Northwest, the essential character of this landscape, you have to get into the mindset of a canoe-Indian, and learn to see the water as a place, with the forests and mountains as mostly undifferentiated space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I needed to sail to Alaska in order to understand this other, watery dimension of my new home. I wanted to take my place in that floating cavalcade of Indians, white explorers, fishermen, missionaries, anthropologists, loggers, tourists, and everyone else for whom the water here has been important. I wanted to explore the many meanings of the sea by focusing on the sea in my own backyard - a sea providentially rich in history and significance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I thought that writing a waterborne book, set along the 1000-mile length of the Inside Passage, would be a good way - as Bad Land had been - of putting down my own roots here, and making myself belong to this landscape. That was before I made the voyage - which, as it turned out, damned near uprooted me altogether...<br><br>Q: In Passage to Juneau, you write about your journey from Seattle to Alaska; Captain Vancouver covered the same territory in 1792-1794, a voyage that you describe vividly. Tell us about Captain Van, and his trials and tribulations.<br>A: My alter ego. Short, fat, unwell, pop-eyed, socially inadequate. I am intensely fond of him. Humanly, he was a dry stick; an old fogey at 34. He was saddled with a bunch of fashionable, upper-class midshipmen, who despised him. He was perfectly out of touch with the great movements of his time. The Romantic glory of wilderness quite passed him by. What he would have liked to discover here was a sort of far-western version of Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey. What he found was a country of hideous and gloomy mountains, ugly cascades, depressing forests, and a sea of baffling tides and ship-swallowing whirlpools. He was the Pacific Northwest's least likely immigrant...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But he supplies a wonderful pair of eyes for a writer to look out through - he's a far more interesting character than the young fashionables, who were able to see the Northwestern wilderness as the apotheosis of the Romantic Sublime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"Sublime? Bah!" says Captain Van, whose invariable descriptive term for craggy, snowcapped mountains was "sterile". He was a brilliant navigator and map-maker, but grimly literal-minded when it came to people and landscape. In the book, he's a foil to everyone, from the midshipmen, to Wordsworth and Shelley, and John Muir, and me. I mustn't make him sound like a monster, for he's utterly sympathetic in his unhappiness -- and I think it was profound -- at finding himself here.<br><br>Q: Have you always been adventurous, the kind of person for whom travel and exploration are crucial to survival?<br>A: What? I think you've got the wrong writer. I am timid in the extreme. My travels, such as they are, are safe and unadventurous. I travel furthest and deepest in libraries, not over the water or over the ground. I've never climbed a proper mountain, never crossed an ocean under my own steam, or sail. I am sedentary and bookish by nature; a stay-at-home. I think you must have been thinking of Jon Krakauer.<br><br>Q: You capture the American psyche through its people and places. Do you find it easy to walk into a place you've never been and get people to open up? Is that just part of being a writer?<br>A: I do a lot of looking, and a good deal of listening. I never "interview" people. But being alone on a journey for any stretch of time makes one hungry for company, and I am always grateful for whatever scraps of conversation come my way. I don't go searching for "characters," but I enjoy chance encounters with anyone who happens to cross my path...not very many in Passage to Juneau, when three and four days would go by without my speaking to another soul. So I kept company with Captain Van, and Franz Boas, and long-dead Indian storytellers, and William Wordsworth...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But the question raises another one, about characters-in-a-landscape. I'm passionately interested in the relationship between the character one is and the landscape in which that character is formed. I know I'm a different person living here in Seattle from the man I used to be who lived in London, and I think that character is essentially fluid; it alters according to the circumstances in which it finds itself. I wonder what you'd become if I took you away from New York and installed you alone on an Alaskan island? It's an experiment that I'd like to conduct. So talking with people, seeing them in their natural habitat, as it were, I always find myself discovering a lot of their landscape in their character, and something of their character in the landscape itself. As an expatriate, living in a landscape that still feels subtly alien to me after nearly ten years, I'm acutely aware of this continual exchange between landscape and character, and of the gulf between people who are at home in their landscape - whether it's the Upper West Side or a fish-camp in British Columbia - and people like me, who are never quite at home anywhere.<br><br>Q: Where does your passion for sailing come from?<br>A: It's not a passion for sailing. I've always been fascinated by water, especially by the movements of water...ripples, eddies, waves, turbulence. Water in motion is the best model of chaos as physicists use that term. Look at a tide flowing through a narrow passage between islands - its rips, boils, whirlpools, overfalls - and you're face to face with chaos. There's something about the idea of a boat afloat on turbulent water that excites me, partly for its own sake, partly as a metaphor. As for sailing, it's mostly quiet, slow, meditative; an ideal way to study the water and watch the land. Hitching a free ride on the breeze, you feel a part of the nature that you sail through. A car detaches you from the landscape; a sailboat immerses you in it. My boat - a rather elderly ketch, 35 feet long, built in Sweden in 1972 - serves as an observation platform, a mobile library, a floating country cottage. It's my second home.<br><br>Q: Your knowledge of Northwest tribal art and mythology is impressive. How did you do the research, and was this uncharted territory for you before you started to write Passage to Juneau?<br>A: I've been looking at Indian art and reading Indian stories since I first came here in 1990. The penny suddenly dropped for me in the summer of 1990, when the boat was tied up in Victoria harbor, at the south end of Vancouver Island. I had spent most of an afternoon gazing at Indian masks and painted chests in the Royal British Columbia Museum. The weather was sultry and windless. When I went back to the boat I sat out in the cockpit, staring at the water, which was oily-calm, faintly rippled by the leftover wakes of float planes and motor boats. Fragmentary reflections kept on dissolving and reforming in the mirror-surface of the water, and I realized that I'd spent all afternoon looking at an art of watery reflections just like these: the Kwakiutl Indians were representing life as it was reflected by the ripples and wavelets of their native sea... Since then, I've haunted places like the Museum of Natural History in New York and the Menil<br>Collection in Houston, in pursuit of this stylized, extraordinarily dramatic maritime art of the Northwest coast. I don't think of it as "research." I do it for my own pleasure. With Indian stories ("myths" is a dubious word for them), it's been a little different. I'm a literary critic by training, and I was fascinated by the structural oddity of the stories collected by Boas and others; their version of narrative - of what happens when, and how - struck me as alien and bizarre. So I tried to learn to read them, not as anthropologists do, milking them for their encoded information about the culture, but as a sympathetic critic, getting in tune with their world, listening for subtexts and ironies. They figure importantly in the book.<br><br>Q: I'm not sure what kind of book Passage to Juneau is. Is it a memoir, a travel book, a social history? What is it?<br>A: Those damned categories! Luckily, they're more of a concern for librarians than they are for writers, or for readers. I've always been interested in books that slip and slide between the genres. Like Bruce Chatwin's Songlines - which was published as a novel in England, but under the non-fiction rubric of "Australia - description and travel" in the U.S. Or Thomas Kenneally's Schindler's Ark, published here as History, but which in England won the Booker Prize for Fiction. Or, most recently, that lovely book by W.G. Sebald, The Rings of Saturn, which you could label as a travelogue, or a personal memoir, or a meditation on English and German history. It's all of those things, but Sebald calls it "a novel," for want of a better word. Passage to Juneau is like that - a braid of memoir, history, travel, anthropology, art and literary criticism...all of those things, and none of them, at the same time. What I hope is that it is a lucid narrative, and to hell with the genres.<br><br>Q: You dedicate your book to your daughter Julia; we met her in Passage to Juneau, and seemed like a curious and adventurous three-and-a-half year old. Has Julia taken up sailing yet?<br>A: Not with quite the avid enthusiasm that I'd like to see. She'll be seven in November, and she has omnivorous social appetites. I have to fill the boat with other people before she really enjoys it. I'm reassured to see that she hasn't inherited my eccentric taste for solitude.<br><br>Q: What's next for Jonathan Raban?<br>A: A book set in Seattle, to be published as a novel. I began as a fiction writer, but haven't written a novel since 1985, when Foreign Land came out. The novel has always been the quintessential mixed genre, boiling up the real and the imaginary in the same pot. So there's a lot of reality in the book I'm working on. Seattle is a real - or at least a virtual - city. Bill Gates - I believe -exists. And so do people like Nathan Myrhvold and Jeff Bezos. They'll be in the book, rubbing shoulders on equal terms with people you won't find in any phone book, and who are quite unknown to the I.R.S. and the Social Security Administration.</p><h2>Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant (Volume 2)</h2><p><p>This digital reproduction &nbsp;of the C.L.&nbsp;Webster Shoulder Board Set is Volume 2&nbsp;of 2. The type has also been enlarged to create a large print edition.</p><p>Born in 1822, Grant was the son of an Ohio tanner. He went to West Point reluctantly and graduated in the middle of his class. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Grant was appointed by the governor to command an unruly volunteer regiment, quickly rising to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. In February 1862, he took Fort Henry and attacked Fort Donelson. When the Confederate commander asked for terms, Grant replied, No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.' The Confederates surrendered, and President Lincoln promoted Grant to major general of volunteers. At Shiloh in April, Grant fought one of the bloodiest battles in the West and came out less well. Lincoln fended off demands for his removal by saying, "I can't spare this man he fights".&nbsp;For his next major objective, Grant then maneuvered and fought skillfully to win Vicksburg, the key city on the Mississippi, cutting the Confederacy in two. Then he broke the Confederate hold on Chattanooga. Lincoln appointed him General-in-Chief in March 1864. Grant directed Sherman to drive through the South while he himself, with the Army of the Potomac, pinned down General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Finally, on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House, Lee surrendered. Grant wrote out magnanimous terms of surrender that would prevent treason trials. As President, Grant presided over the Government much as he had run the Army. Indeed he brought part of his Army staff to the White House. After retiring from the Presidency, Grant became a partner in a financial firm, which went bankrupt. About that time he learned that he had cancer of the throat. He started writing his recollections to pay off his debts and provide for his family, racing against death to produce these Memoirs. Soon after completing the last page, in 1885, he died.</p></p><p>Ulysses S. Grant was an outstanding military figure and the savior of the Union during the Civil War, as well as the 18th President of the United States from 1869-77. He was an author of unusual ability and his Memoirs are widely regarded as one of the great books written in the English language. He was also a complex individual with uncommon virtues.<p>Born in 1822, Grant was the son of an Ohio tanner. He went to West Point rather against his will and graduated in the middle of his class.

As president, Grant implemented Congressional Reconstruction, often at odds with Lincoln&#39;s successor, Andrew Johnson. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and supported unbridled industrial expansionism during the Gilded Age. --Wikipedia</p><h2>The Fountain Tarot Journal: A Year in 52 Readings</h2><p><b>Turn your favorite tarot deck into a weekly ritual of reflection and self-discovery.</b><br><br>This guided journal from the bestselling <i>Fountain Tarot</i> creators offers both a comprehensive introduction to the art of reading tarot as well as prompts and writing space to transform your tarot readings into a regular tool as you chart your inner journey.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inspired by the popular <i>Fountain Tarot</i>, but adaptable for use with any tarot deck, the book includes instructions on how to read tarot for beginners, including an introduction to tarot basics and detailed sample spreads and readings.

Loaded with helpful photos, this guide is a virtual art class in a book.</p><p>Leni Levenson Wiener is an art quilter, instructor, and author. Her work has been exhibited throughout the United States and internationally and appears in compilation books of art quilts. Leni lives just outside of New York City with her husband.Anyone interested in creating pictorial quilts based on photos would benefit from this book. Leni takes the reader through all the steps of creating an art quilt from making and printing a pattern to finishing your work. Along the way she shares valuable information on color, value, and fabric selection, as well as tricks for creating common elements used in landscapes and portraits. (<i>Machine Quilting Unlimited, November/December 2014</i>)<br><br>Transform your photos into gallery-worthy fabric art by following Leni&#x2019;s simple methods. She will show you how to choose the right fabric, create patterns with free software, depict common elements (such as grass, trees, water and faces), layer and sew your collages, and finish your work for display. There are complete patterns and instructions for two quilts, as well as an "Art Quilter&#x2019;s Value Scale" to help you with fabric selection. (<i>Quilter's Digest, June 2014</i>)<br><br>Nothing is as charming as capturing a loved one or a special place in a quilt. If you have always wanted to do just that, but didn&#x2019;t know where to start, then Leni Levenson Wiener&#x2019;s book Pictorial Art Quilt Guidebook: Secrets to Capturing Your Photos in Fabric has most of the answers you are looking for. Leni says &#x201c;throw away your color wheel&#x201d; then proceeds to tell you just what you need to know about color and value. You will also enjoy her take on fabric, building your stash and when to use what pattern or print. Work from your favorite photo or, to begin with, use the complete patterns and instructions included for two projects found in the book. Everything you need to know to create your own art quilt is covered in this well thought out book. Leni even offers links to free software that will help you design your pattern. Leni&#x2019;s method uses freezer paper for the pattern pieces and once cut they are glued in place with just a tiny dot of fabric glue. Once finished you will need to decide if you want to add batting or not. There are instructions for stretching your piece onto canvas stretchers. (<i>The Applique Society Newsletter, 11/3/14</i>)<br><br>I have a fondness for collage, and this highly usable, user-friendly guidebook teaches you how to take a photo and translate it into a fabric collage. Leni Weiner's premise is that the photo frees her from figuring out the proportions, perspective, light and shadows. Using a photo, Leni creates a full-size pattern, traces sections onto freezer paper and uses the pieces to cut fabric. (One tip Leni shares is to use the free program GIMP to work with your photos.) Leni divides the book into three sections. First, you will learn about color (without needing your color wheel), value, print and scale. She has a wonderful value scale of gradations in gray, from white to black, so you can identify what value your fabric is. With the fundamentals in place, Leni takes you step-by-step through making an art quilt from a photo. When you are ready to venture on your own, you can use her practical ways to approach common elements, such as trees, rocks, and animal and people features. An additional project is also included. I cannot wait to delve more deeply into the process. (<i>Professional Quilter Magazine, 11/11/14</i>)<br><br>Pictorial Art Quilts look impressive and complex and here, Leni Levenson Wiener covers the requirements for making successful quilts of this type.Rather than solely concentrating on technique, the thinking behind creating pictorial quilts is explored in some depth. A strong focus is placed on the use of values in fabric choices, which quite often make or break an image. Under the Setting the Stage section, colour choice is considered alongside values and the choice of patterned and printed fabric.Moving into the actual construction of a quilt, you are taken through the stages, from making and printing a pattern from your photo, which can be done on Photoshop (by using Cutout in the Filter Gallery) or a free download called Gimp, which the author finds easier to use and teach with. You are taught to print out a full sized picture of your desired quilt size and then start to plan the pattern and colours. As raised previously, value is of great importance in this technique and Leni Levenson Wiener has included an Art Quilter's Value Scale in the book to help you choose fabrics that match those in the original image. It is a card that canbe cut out of the book and has 12 different values that you lay alongside your pattern to discern what scale each value in the image is, which you can then use against your fabric to ensure the same value is achieved. This is a very useful piece of kit, especially if value has always seemed an indecipherable concept.The mechanics of putting together all your pieces is covered in illustrated steps and there are little asides and notes to give you useful tips and hints to help troubleshoot or simplify the process, if it's getting too complicated. Once the main body of the book is dealt with, there is a third section which covers common elements in pictorial quilts such as trees, the sky, water or rocks, animals, feathers, eyes and skin tone, to name a few. This ensures that the approach to most of the subjects of such quilts will be covered, whatever is chosen. There are plenty of photos throughout to show how cleverly selected fabric assists in thecreation of texture and pattern for elements such as hair, leaves and water. A good book for anyone wanting to explore this type of quilting.

After launching a graphic design business and then a family, she began to write and illustrate children&#39;s books, something she&#39;d wanted to do since second grade. Ms. Falwell lives in Gorham, Maine."Clearly designed to help a toddler accept a new brother or sister, this pastel-colored picture book, with minimal text and simple illustrations, celebrates having a new baby in the family. The small child is a big part of every picture. Double-paged spreads with large, clear shapes show the smiling parents and child together, looking at the baby, touching it, holding it, feeding it, washing it. . . . The softly textured illustrations and the rhythm of the few plain words together express the physicalness of the experience." Booklist, ALA<br><br>"An inviting concept book that should find a warm welcome in many newly expanded families." Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Each new facet of taking care of a baby is brought out in this charming picture book. not only are new infants exciting, they're also a big responsibility as Falwell gently reinforces. With an economy of text and simple illustrations, she describes bringing a baby home, involving a sibling in its care, and a happy family going through its routine. Soft pastel hues of pinks and salmons, purples and blues highlight the action. . . . A sound addition to the large body of books about babies."

It is a tale of heroism and resistance, of friendship and romance, and of unwavering devotion&#x2015;including the readiness to risk one&#x2019;s life&#x2015;to literature and art. And it is entirely true. Based on Jewish, German, and Soviet documents, including diaries, letters, memoirs, and the author&#x2019;s interviews with several of the story&#x2019;s participants, The Book Smugglers chronicles the daring activities of a group of poets turned partisans and scholars turned smugglers in Vilna, &#x201c;The Jerusalem of Lithuania.&#x201d; The rescuers were pitted against Johannes Pohl, a Nazi &#x201c;expert&#x201d; on the Jews, who had been dispatched to Vilna by the Nazi looting agency, Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, to organize the seizure of the city&#x2019;s great collections of Jewish books. Pohl and his Einsatzstab staff planned to ship the most valuable materials to Germany and incinerate the rest. The Germans used forty ghetto inmates as slave-laborers to sort, select, pack, and transport the materials, either to Germany or to nearby paper mills. This group, nicknamed &#x201c;the Paper Brigade,&#x201d; and informally led by poet Shmerke Kaczerginski, a garrulous, street-smart adventurer and master of deception, smuggled thousands of books and manuscripts past German guards. If caught, the men would have faced death by firing squad at Ponar, the mass-murder site outside of Vilna. To store the rescued manuscripts, poet Abraham Sutzkever helped build an underground book-bunker sixty feet beneath the Vilna ghetto. Kaczerginski smuggled weapons as well, using the group&#x2019;s worksite, the former building of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, to purchase arms for the ghetto&#x2019;s secret partisan organization. All the while, both men wrote poetry that was recited and sung by the fast-dwindling population of ghetto inhabitants. With the Soviet &#x201c;liberation&#x201d; of Vilna (now known as Vilnius), the Paper Brigade thought themselves and their precious cultural treasures saved&#x2015;only to learn that their new masters were no more welcoming toward Jewish culture than the old, and the books must now be smuggled out of the USSR. Thoroughly researched by the foremost scholar of the Vilna Ghetto&#x2015;a writer of exceptional daring, style, and reach&#x2015;The Book Smugglers is an epic story of human heroism, a little-known tale from the blackest days of the war.</p><p>DAVID E.

An oasis of calm that borders no coastline, the sea is littered with sargassum, a thick seaweed that once fooled Christopher Columbus into believing he was close to land. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The Sargasso is constantly moving, its location determined by the North Equatorial and Gulf Stream currents, as well as those of the Antilles, Canary, and Caribbean. These interlocking forces stabilize the sea like the eye of a great hurricane, while causing its waters to rotate clockwise. As a result, things that enter the Sargasso are gradually drawn toward its center like a giant shower drain, where they eventually sink to the bottom, or, in the case of oil, form thick tar balls and float. There is a great deal of oil in the Sargasso, and with each new spill the problem grows worse, affecting all the sea creatures that inhabit the region. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The Sargasso marks the beginning of my tale and its end, and perhaps that is fitting, for all things birthed in this mysterious body of water eventually return here to die, or so I have learned. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> If each of us has his or her own Sargasso, then mine was the Highlands of Scotland. I was born in the village of Drumnadrochit, seven months and twenty- five years ago, give or take a few days. My mother, Andrea, was American, a quiet soul who came to the United Kingdom on holiday and stayed nine years in a bad marriage. My father, Angus Wallace, the cause of its termination, was a brute of a man, possessing jet- black hair and the piercing blue eyes of the Gael, the wile of a Scot, and the temperament of a Viking. An only child, I took my father&#x2019;s looks and, thankfully, my mother&#x2019;s disposition. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Angus&#x2019;s claim to fame was that his paternal ancestors were descendants of the great William Wallace himself, a name I doubt most non- Britons would have recognized until Mel Gibson portrayed him in the movie Braveheart. As a child, I often asked Angus to prove we were kin of the great Sir William Wallace, but he&#x2019;d merely tap his chest and say, "Listen, runt, some things ye jist feel. When ye become a real man, ye&#x2019;ll ken whit I mean." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> I grew to calling my father Angus and he called me his "runt"and neither was meant as an endearing term. Born with a mild case of hypotonia, my muscles were too weak to allow for normal development, and it would be two years (to my father&#x2019;s embarrassment) before I had the strength to walk. By the time I was five I could run like a deer, but being smaller than my burly, big- boned Highland peers, I was always picked on. Weekly contests between hamlets on the football pitch (rugby field) were nightmares. Being fleet of foot meant I had to carry the ball, and I&#x2019;d often find myself in a scrum beneath boys twice my size. While I lay bleeding and broken on the battlefield, my inebriated father would prance about the sidelines, howling with the rest of his drunken cronies, wondering why the gods had cursed him with such a runt for a son. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> According to the child- rearing philosophy of Angus Wallace, tough love was always best in raising a boy. Life was hard, and so childhood had to be hard, or the seedling would rot before it grew. It was the way Angus&#x2019;s father had raised him, and his father&#x2019;s father before that. And if the seedling was a runt, then the soil had to be tilled twice as hard. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> But the line between tough love and abuse is often blurred by alcohol, and it was when Angus was inebriated that I feared him most. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> His final lesson of my childhood left a lasting impression. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> It happened a week before my ninth birthday. Angus, sporting a whisky buzz, led me to the banks of Aldourie Castle, a three- century- old chateau that loomed over the misty black waters of Loch Ness. "Now pay attention, runt, for it&#x2019;s time I telt ye o&#x2019; the Wallace curse. My faither, yer grandfaither, Logan Wallace, he died in these very waters when I wis aboot yer age. An awfy gale hit the Glen, an&#x2019; his boat flipped. Everyone says he drooned, but I ken better, see. &#x2019;Twis the monster that got him, an&#x2019; ye best be warned, for&#x2014;" <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Monster? Are ye talkin&#x2019; aboot Nessie?"I asked, pie- eyed. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Nessie? Nessie&#x2019;s folklore. I&#x2019;m speakin&#x2019; o&#x2019; a curse wrought by nature, a curse that&#x2019;s haunted the Wallace men since the passin&#x2019; o&#x2019; Robert the Bruce." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "I dinnae understand." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Growing angry, he dragged me awkwardly to the edge of Aldourie Pier. "Look doon, laddie. Look doon intae the Loch an&#x2019; tell me whit ye see?" <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> I leaned out carefully over the edge, my heart pattering in my bony chest. "I dinnae see anythin&#x2019;, the water&#x2019;s too black." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Aye, but if yer eyes could penetrate the depths, ye&#x2019;d see intae the dragon&#x2019;s lair. The de&#x2019;il lurks doon there, but it can sense oor presence, it can smell the fear in oor blood. By day the Loch&#x2019;s ours, for the beast prefers the depths, but God help ye at night when she rises tae feed." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "If the monster&#x2019;s real, then I&#x2019;ll rig a lure an&#x2019; bring her up." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Is that so? An&#x2019; who be ye? Wiser men have tried an&#x2019; failed, an&#x2019; looked foolish in their efforts, whilst a bigger price wis paid by those drowned who ventured out oot night." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Ye&#x2019;re jist tryin&#x2019; tae scare me.

Go on, laddie, go for a swim and let her get a good whiff o&#x2019; ye." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> He pushed me toward the edge and I gagged at his breath, but held tight to his belt buckle. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Jist as I thought." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Frightened, I pried myself loose and ran from the pier, the tears streaming down my cheeks. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Ye think I&#x2019;m hard on ye, laddie? Well, life&#x2019;s hard, an&#x2019; I&#x2019;m nothin&#x2019; compared tae that monster. Ye best pay attention, for the curse skips every other generation, which means ye&#x2019;re marked.

In that time I had lost my accent and learned that my father was right, that I was indeed haunted by a dragon, only his name was Angus Wallace. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Arriving in a foreign land is never easy for a boy, and the physical and psychological baggage I carried from my childhood left me fodder for the bullies of my new school. At least in Drumnadrochit I had allies like my pal, True MacDonald, but here I was all alone, a fish out of water, and there were many a dark day that I seriously considered ending my life. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> And then I met Mr. Tkalec. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Joe Tkalec was our middle school&#x2019;s science teacher, a kind Croatian man with rectangular glasses, a quick wit, and a love for poetry. Seeing that the "Scottish weirdo"was being picked on unmercifully, Mr. Tkalec took me under his wing, allowing me special classroom privileges like caring for his lab animals, small deeds that helped nurture my self- image. After school, I&#x2019;d ride my bike over to Mr. Tkalec&#x2019;s home, which contained a vast collection of books. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Zachary, the human mind is the instrument that determines how far we&#x2019;ll go in life. There&#x2019;s only one way to develop the mind and that&#x2019;s to read. My library&#x2019;s yours, select any book and take it home, but return only after you&#x2019;ve finished it." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The first volume I chose was the oldest book in his collection, The Origins of an Evolutionist, my eyes drawn by the author&#x2019;s name, Alfred Russel Wallace. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Born in 1823, Alfred Wallace was a brilliant British evolutionist, geographer, anthropologist, and theorist, often referred to as Charles Darwin&#x2019;s right- hand man, though their ideas were not always in step. In his biography, Alfred mentioned that he too was a direct descendant of William Wallace, making us kin, and that he also suffered childhood scars brought about by an overbearing father. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The thought of being related to Alfred Wallace instantly changed the way I perceived myself, and his words regarding adaptation and survival put wind in my fallen sails. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "...we have here an acting cause to account for that balance so often observed in Nature&amp;...</p><h2>Slow Burn: Zero Day, Book 1</h2><p>A new flu strain has been spreading across Africa, Europe, and Asia.

For it was in the Adirondacks that masses of non-Native Americans first learned to cherish the wilderness as a place of recreation and solace.</p><p>In this lyrical narrative history, the author reveals that the affair between Americans and the Adirondacks was by no means one of love at first sight. And even now, Schneider shows that Americans' relationship with the glorious mountains and rivers of the Adirondacks continues to change. As in every good romance, nothing is as simple as it appears.</p></p><p>The vast Adirondack region of upstate New York is very much a wilderness, but one ringed by towns and close enough to major cities that it is heavily traveled. Long viewed as a natural playground, the Adirondacks were a favorite haunt of transcendentalist philosophers Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, of conservationists such as Franklin Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt, of bohemians and hippies, and of back-to-the-land types. Still wild enough that wolf reintroduction has been proposed for the Adirondacks, the territory remains a powerfully inspiring place of refuge and recreation. Paul Schneider tells the story of this river-laced, forested land with imagination and a flair for just the right anecdote.<p><b>Paul Schneider</b> lives in West Tisbury, Massachusetts, and New York City.

Cross Game is a moving drama that is heartfelt and true, yet in the brilliant hands of manga artist Mitsuru Adachi, delightfully flows with a light and amusing touch. The series centers around a boy named Ko, the family of four sisters who live down the street and the game of baseball. This poignant coming-of-age story will change your perception of what shonen manga can be.</p><p>One of the biggest names in the manga industry today, Mitsuru Adachi made his debut in 1970 with <i>Kieta Bakuon</i> in the pages of <i>Deluxe Shonen Sunday</i>. The creator of numerous mega-hits such as <i>Touch</i>, <i>Miyuki</i>, and <i>Cross Game</i>, Adachi sensei received the Shogakukan Manga Award for all three of the aforementioned series.

The result is a work filled with the attributes of Barcelona itself: proportion, humor, and&nbsp;<i>seny</i>&#x2014;the Catalan word for triumphant common sense.</p><p>&#34;An extraordinary book that combines history, criticism of the arts and architecture, and a profound sympathy for the moral essence of a people.&#34;--Newsday"Confirms...Mr. Hughes's authority as a first-rate chronicler and historian.

This volume is a complete and in-depth study in the &#34;Art of Drawing Spirits into Crystals&#34; as found in Francis Barrett&#39;s, The Magus, and accredited to Trithemius of Spanheim. Detailed research, personal experimentation, and evoking each of the seven planetary archangels and intelligences to visible and auditory presence are presented within. You will find descriptions of the seven planetary archangels as witnessed by the author, instructions for building each of the traditional implements and furniture to the specifications of the grimoire, as well as detailed illustrations of the author&#39;s actual equipment. Items such as the infamous Book of Spirits or Liber Spirituum are explained in detail so the reader will know how to make and use one. Chapters also describe methods for improving scrying abilities, working with a partner, and conducting the entire ceremony from beginning to end. Everything to make this art work is explained in incredibly vivid detail. The purpose for this book is to present a workable manual wherein the aspiring magus can replicate a valuable system of magic to achieve successful and reliable discourse with some of the most powerful beings in the cosmos. &#34;No other book has unveiled how to perform this experiment successfully within the traditional manner.&#34; This work is not a theoretical analysis of a historic manuscript from an academic scholar, nor is it based on presumption and guess work. It is a modern day grimoire from a traditional grimorist. It is drawn from one who has been studying and practicing Western occult magic for nearly two decades and has recreated the procedures that achieve results. The methods contained within are constructed as closely to the original text as possible and filled with suggestions and points to assist the beginning magician as well as the advanced practitioner.</p><p></p><h2>Sir John Franklin&#39;s Erebus and Terror Expedition: Lost and Found</h2><p><p><b>The true story of Sir John Franklin&#x2019;s fateful expedition in HMS <i>Erebus</i> and HMS <i>Terror</i> of the North-West Passage in 1845, and the eventual discovery of the ships' wrecks in 2014 and 2016.</b></p><p>In 1845, British explorer Sir John Franklin set out on a voyage to find the North-West Passage--the sea route linking the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.

The concluding two pages show the dinosaurs snug in their beds under a star-sprinkled sky. Friendly, colorful characters fill each spread, and text in a bold, playful font tells the story. Illustrations in watercolor and pencil fill the spreads. Onomatopoetic, noisy words are repeated, which can help children sound them out phonetically.

Pearce. This audacious questioning of the current medical system&#x2019;s ability to deal with the modern epidemic of chronic illness, combines a raw personal memoir of sickness and healing, woven through with voices of dozens of other long-term sick women of the world and a feminine cultural critique that digs deep into the roots of patriarchal medicine. Pearce takes us from its ancient Greek roots, through the influences of the Enlightenment and Christianity, the wholesale destruction of the wise woman tradition and Western colonial destruction of native medicines to the current technocratic, capitalist model of medicine.<i>Medicine Woman</i> asks the uncomfortable questions that our culture refuses to face:�Why chronic illness, mental health issues, medical prescriptions and costs are rising exponentially.�Why women are the major sufferers of the modern epidemic of auto-immune conditions.�Why women are twice as likely to be medicated for depression.�Why women tend to be taken less seriously by medical professionals.Medicine Woman voices a deep yearning for a broader vision of what it means to be human than our current paradigm allows for, calling on an ancient archetype of healing, Medicine Woman, to re-vision how we can navigate sickness and harness its transformational powers in order to heal. Packed with dozens of healing arts exercises and hundreds of medicine questions to help integrate body and mind in the healing process. Like Burning Woman, this book promises initiation by transmission, reconnecting us directly with the soul of healing.</p><p><p><em>This is Lucy Pearce's opus - a body of work which requires a lifetime of preparation to garner this kind of courage that boldly sets raw truth free. In doing so her words unshackle others too. Medicine Woman is a clarion call in a world where we are needing to heal generational wounds, to own where we have been complicit so we can make room for the collective rise that seeks another way forward.</em><br> <strong>ALisa Starkweather, founder of the Red Tent Temple Movement</strong></p><p><em>Lucy Pearce is a luminous voice in global change - a voice that calls out for a return to balance of the feminine and masculine energies to heal the very world all beings depend upon to continue existing - preferably thriving. Medicine Woman is needed wake up words in a world gone numb.</em><br> <strong>Paula Youmell, RN, Wise Woman Nurse(R), author of<em> Hands on Health and Weaving Healing Wisdom</em></strong></p><p>Lucy Pearce writes with a blazing mix of passion and vulnerability as she boldly explores the complexities of health issues facing contemporary women. This hard-hitting narrative exposes the undeniable bias that shapes modern medicine and keeps women sick. Pearce gives voice to the silent epidemic of invisible illness. Her revelations are cataclysmic. With an unwavering commitment to healing, and through harnessing the primal creative power of the feminine, this book offers real hope to those who suffer. Medicine Woman heralds the reclaiming of our innate power to heal ourselves. This deeply personal work offers all women the opportunity to take full responsibility for our lives and thrive.<br> <strong>Teresa Maria Bilowus, woman, mother, author, mentor and founder of the 'Voices From The Red Tent' project</strong></p><p><em>In Medicine Woman, Lucy H. Pearce continues her invaluable work of reawakening the Sacred Feminine and connecting women to their inherent wisdom. Pulling back the curtain on the male-dominated medical model of the current era, Pearce reveals the systematic and intentional suppression of feminine knowledge and intuition, and in doing so invites modern women to reclaim their own healing journey. The Medicine Woman archetype is needed in our culture now more than ever as women awaken to the healing power and potential that lies within each of us.</em><br> <strong>Amy Bammel Wilding, author of<em> Wild &amp; Wise: Sacred Feminine Meditations for Women's Circles and Personal Awakening</em></strong></p></p><h2>The Great Gamble: The Soviet War in Afghanistan</h2><p><p>The Soviet war in Afghanistan was a grueling debacle that has striking lessons for the twenty-first century. In <i>The Great Gamble</i>, Gregory Feifer examines the conflict from the perspective of the soldiers on the ground. In gripping detail, he vividly depicts the invasion of a volatile country that no power has ever successfully conquered. A riveting account as seen through the eyes of the men who fought in the war, <i>The Great Gamble</i> tells an unforgettable story full of drama, action, and political intrigue whose relevance in our own time is greater than ever.</p></p><p><p>Gregory Feifer is the former Moscow correspondent for National Public Radio. He was educated at Harvard University and lives in Prague with his wife, Elizabeth, and son, Sebastian.</p>Feifer&#x2019;s account of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s 1979 invasion and 10-year occupation of Afghanistan from 1979&#x2013;89 builds on considerable original research and on Russian-language histories not available in English. Emphasizing the experiences of Soviet personnel sent to Afghanistan, Feifer portrays their war within the context of political and military decisions that led to their fighting in Afghanistan. The actual decision by Soviet leaders to invade was, as far as Feifer can discover, a muddle. It came after the Communist government in Kabul, unable to quash violent resistance to its program, split apart in bloody factional fighting. But by staging a coup to install their stooge Babrak Karmal in power, the Soviets took the war into their own hands and escalated it accordingly. Their major offensives, acording to Feifer, never delivered a strategic victory, though they tended to prevail in individual battles&nbsp;depicted in the stories of several Soviet officers and soldiers. Tracing&nbsp;the arc of the Soviets&#x2019; military disillusionment in Afghanistan, Feifer, who is an NPR reporter in Moscow, provides essential historical background to the present war in Afghanistan. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Come Rain or Come Shine (Mitford Series, 11)</h2><p>#1 New York Times&#x2013;bestselling author Jan Karon returns&#x2015;with the story readers have been waiting for.<br> <br> Over the course of ten Mitford novels, fans have kept a special place in their hearts for Dooley Kavanagh, first seen in At Home in Mitford as a barefoot, freckle-faced boy in filthy overalls.<br> <br> Now, Father Tim Kavanagh&#x2019;s adopted son has graduated from vet school and opened his own animal clinic.

Dystocia.&#x2019;</p><p>Life was happening fast.&nbsp; Dooley&#x2019;s graduation from vet school was coming up in a few weeks, then the bull delivery, then the practice turning over from Hal Owen, and on June fourteenth, the wedding... </p><p>&#x2018;So how&#x2019;s Choo-Choo&#x2019;s disposition?&#x2019;&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s got calves all over the county. He&#x2019;s famous for gettin&#x2019; the job done.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And you bought him because...?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not good timing, for sure, but the owner needed to let him go.&nbsp; It was me or somebody else.&nbsp; I could never top the price. Pliers.&#x2019;</p><p>Tales about Choo-Choo were circulating at the co-op, at least one of them embellished with a direct warning.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2018;It&#x2019;ll be good to get out with your cattle in the evenings. Relaxing.&#x2019;&nbsp; He was repeating what the neighbors said about having &#x2018;a few head&#x2019; on the place. </p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ll treat small animals at th&#x2019; clinic and I&#x2019;ll have my large animal practice out here on th&#x2019; back forty. I really wanted a mixed practice but there&#x2019;s a great vet just a few miles north. She does it all and does it well.&#x2019; Dooley wiped the sweat from his eyes. &#x2018;Hal loved doing it all but he says he won&#x2019;t miss it; he was on call twenty-four/seven. I&#x2019;d like to give it everything I&#x2019;ve got during the day, and have time in the evenings to spend with Lace&#x2014;with, you know...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Sure.&nbsp; With family. When you have children...&#x2019;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t mean to say that, not at all, it had popped out from overlong suppression.&nbsp; </p><p>The look on Dooley&#x2019;s face...</p><p>He had stepped in it, for sure.&nbsp; Craving grandkids was the vice of those wishing to assure mortality. </p><p>He let the air clear. &#x2018;So. Scared?&#x2019;</p><p>Dooley gave him an ironic look. &#x2018;Were you scared?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I was. Then the peace flowed in.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Need th&#x2019; crimper again,&#x2019; said Dooley.</p><p>It was cool to know what this stuff was.&nbsp; He hauled the thing out of the workbox.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;Thanks, but that&#x2019;s the tamper.&#x2019;</p><p>So this is what people called the simple life.&nbsp; He wiped his face with a bandana and went diving for the crimper.</p><p>Ever since they moved to Meadowgate a month ago, the entire household had gone hammer and tong making the old place ready for the Big Knot. </p><p>They had re-painted the interior of the vet clinic, re-finished the clinic floors and installed new exam tables.&nbsp; He declined to help Cynthia and Lace make curtains for the farmhouse kitchen and drove with Harley to Holding for a pickup load of furniture for the reception room. Somewhere in there, he had conducted a house blessing and a clinic blessing, replete with thurible.&nbsp; Then came repairs on the barn, some minor guttering work on the house, and before Dooley wheeled in yesterday for the weekend, he and Harley and Willie had weed-whacked the fence line and had a serious conversation with the county agent about liming.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s your broom straw,&#x2019; said the agent.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;What about it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It tells you your place needs lime. Nature&#x2019;s messenger.&#x2019;</p><p>The agent had given him a wealth of material to read on the subject of lime.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;For today&#x2019;s nut to crack, they were awarded the high-tensile-fence-fix-off.&nbsp; He had prayed for a more challenging retirement and here it was in living color. On the other hand, it was the most fun he&#x2019;d had in a coon&#x2019;s age.&nbsp; Not everybody got to watch a young couple build a whole new life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lace Harper studied the canvas on the easel.</p><p>Being stuck happened a lot these days.&nbsp; Maybe she shouldn&#x2019;t be painting to focus her mind or clear it or whatever she was hoping to do. Maybe she should be painting for passion&#x2019;s sake or not at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>But there was no passion in her&#x2014;she was painting by a kind of rote. Every energy had lately been spent on this vast and overwhelming life they were entering, a life they had dreamed of for years and wanted with all their hearts&#x2014;and&nbsp; now what had taken so long seemed so very sudden. </p><p>Suddenly their own kitchen with its amiable fireplace and big windows.&nbsp; Suddenly the old porches and creaking floors, the immense views, the enormous sky, the hundred acres, the doleful heifers with their bran breath&#x2014;all theirs, and right next door, their own animal clinic.&nbsp; It seemed so grown-up to have a place like this.&nbsp; </p><p>A few years ago, Dooley and the trust people bought more land from Hal and Marge Owen. If cattle were to be in the picture, additional acreage would be needed and Hal made sure the price was right, as he&#x2019;d done when Dooley bought out the practice.&nbsp; Everybody had walked away happy, with the Owens keeping the remaining thirty-five acres.&nbsp; So now Hal and Marge and Rebecca Jane lived in the house they built on the hill to the south, and Hal would work part-time during Dooley&#x2019;s first year in practice.</p><p>They were surrounded on every side by people older, wiser, and definitely more patient.&nbsp; This big, new life seemed truly perfect&#x2014;and also truly scary.&nbsp; The money Dooley inherited from Miss Sadie had stretched through his college and vet school years and bought most of the Meadowgate enterprise, with something left over.&nbsp; But there would be no tapping into the remainder of Miss Sadie&#x2019;s amazing trust, not for a long time. </p><p>All that lay ahead would be totally up to them. They had declined any further help from parents and would be living by their wits and on income from the clinic. It was important that the rest of the journey be theirs.&nbsp; </p><p>Bummer. She had no idea how to proceed with this painting.&nbsp; Maybe it was the subject itself.&nbsp; She was concocting apples from a cell phone photo and blurred imagination instead of working plein air beneath a tree heavy with winesaps.</p><p>But she wasn&#x2019;t trying to paint apples as God made them, she was painting at a slant&#x2014;slathering on color with a palette knife, trying to chase the way the light was moving.&nbsp; All she really wanted was an impression of apples, an impression of a basket, an impression of mountains in the background. Anyway, it wasn&#x2019;t a real painting, it was an exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;She stepped away and squinted at the work. Clearly, she was faking it. She could not afford the time required to fake a painting, exercise or not.</p><p>Somehow, she would make it work. Then maybe she could sell it.&nbsp; They needed money now, not just for the wedding, which would be really, really simple, but also for the upkeep of the property and payroll for Willie and Harley and the clinic employees.&nbsp; Only days ago she had sold an oil to Cynthia&#x2019;s friend, Irene McGraw, who was a fabulous painter.&nbsp; She hoped Irene hadn&#x2019;t bought the small picture because she knew &#x2018;the kids&#x2019; were just starting out.&nbsp; Irene had asked the price but she asked Irene to price it instead.</p><p>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t do that,&#x2019; Irene said in her quiet way.&nbsp; </p><p>She had blurted out the first thing that came to mind. &#x2018;Four hundred!&#x2019; She didn&#x2019;t want to overestimate her work, not with Irene.&nbsp; At the same time, four hundred seemed overly modest. She felt awkward and gauche.</p><p>Irene smiled. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve forced me to set the price, after all. It&#x2019;s wonderful piece. Twelve hundred.&#x2019;</p><p>She had the sensation that she might fall backward, and held on to the chair where she was standing.&nbsp; She had sold a lot of work before, but this was especially thrilling because Irene McGraw&#x2019;s paintings were masterful. </p><p>The blood had beat in her again for the work she loved, the gorgeous work with its resinous smells and silken brushes and the restless play of light.</p><p>She should stop now. Time was precious. The Big Knot, as Harley called it, was only weeks away and Dooley&#x2019;s graduation at NC State was practically here, with the bull arriving the day after and the new sign for the vet clinic going up and... </p><p>She turned away from the canvas.</p><p>....and maybe, hopefully, please, God&#x2014;Jack Tyler. </p><p>She felt her heart thump, something like a book dropped to the floor.</p><p>She and Dooley were taking on too much, everyone said that except Father Tim and Cynthia.&nbsp; Father Tim and Cynthia gave them all the liberty they needed, expecting them to do their best. Harley was the biggest objector. &#x2018;Th&#x2019; way y&#x2019;all are goin&#x2019;, you gon&#x2019; be gray-headed.&#x2019; </p><p>&#x2018;Put your teeth in and have a Snickers,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a <i>pot-luck</i>, Harley. Everybody brings food.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s the least stressful thing in the world, a pot-luck wedding.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Then there&#x2019;s ol&#x2019; Choo-Choo comin&#x2019; in,&#x2019; said Harley. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s got ever&#x2019;body on th&#x2019; place rattled.&#x2019; </p><p>True, but why was their bull everybody&#x2019;s business?&nbsp; People should be concentrating on the wedding, on getting the post in the ground for the new sign to be hung. Every time she went to Farmer, people were telling stories about this really mean bull named Choo- Choo&#x2014;at the post office, the co-op, Jake&#x2019;s.&nbsp; </p><p>The grand wedding and honeymoon that her parents, Hoppy and Olivia, had hoped to give them would have eclipsed everything, bull included. She and Dooley were truly grateful, but they had to say they didn&#x2019;t want that.&nbsp; </p><p>She hated, hated to disappoint Olivia and Hoppy who had been so eager to adopt her, Lace Turner, a total rebellious stray from the Creek who should be eager to please them and wear a gorgeous gown and have a wedding with all the frills at Lord&#x2019;s Chapel.</p><p>Olivia had come from a wealthy family. The silver-framed family portraits in all the rooms at Olivia&#x2019;s house were a testament to her paternal line of coal money. But the day she and Dooley went to tell them the plan, both Hoppy and Olivia had laughed with a kind of childlike delight.&nbsp; Olivia thought a country wedding would be &#x2018;the best thing in the whole world&#x2019; and the idea of a potluck was hilarious, but in a good way. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not our wedding,&#x2019; Olivia had said, giving them the best of hugs.&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s yours.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be your wedding photographer,&#x2019; said Hoppy, who had a Nikon and loved to use it.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll make the pies,&#x2019; said Olivia, who had learned pie-baking from a former housekeeper and was proud to call it her specialty. </p><p>&#x2018;Cherry!&#x2019; Dooley had said, about to throw up from stress.</p><p>That had gone so much better than expected; she felt really grateful and later wrote them a long letter.&nbsp; </p><p>But she and Dooley still had to tell Father Tim.&nbsp; Everyone knew he hoped to marry them in the Lord&#x2019;s Chapel rose garden that he and Harley and Dooley&#x2019;s brother, Sammy, recovered from ruin. Everyone knew he had trained the Seven Sisters vines to climb in a really special way on the arch, just for this day.</p><p>Lord&#x2019;s Chapel was where she and Dooley were confirmed and baptized, and where Father Tim and Cynthia and Hoppy and Olivia were married. It was the family church.</p><p>She and Dooley had gone one evening to the yellow house.&nbsp; &#x2018;Give me a sign,&#x2019; Dooley said, &#x2018;like when you think it&#x2019;s a good time.&#x2019;</p><p>There is no good time for this, she thought. </p><p>Cynthia had made spaghetti and later, they all sat by the fire in the study.&nbsp; Dooley jiggled his leg a lot and was finally able to say it. &#x2018;We just want to get married at home, Dad. At Meadowgate. With family and a few friends.&#x2019; </p><p>Father Tim had blinked and there was a long pause as if he were trying to absorb what he heard.&nbsp; </p><p>She looked at Dooley, who was miserable.&nbsp; They had tried so hard to do everything right. Like taking seriously the statistics of a high divorce rate in vet school and the rigor of the courses. They&nbsp; had gone through the awful hunger and frustration of being apart, and the endless road trips that connected the dots between Atlanta and Athens and Mitford and Chapel Hill and Farmer, and NC State where Dooley transferred after college.&nbsp; They had gone through four speeding tickets in as many years, two each, not to mention a huge stack of CDs. And now they both wanted to just be at home, please, God&#x2014;at Meadowgate with family. </p><p>Father Tim had smiled then, and nodded.&nbsp; &#x2018;Good,&#x2019; he said like he really, really meant it. &#x2018;Getting married at home is good.&#x2019; </p><p>She had also written them a long letter. </p><p>So no Vera or Oscar or hair bound up in a chignon. She knew all about those beautiful, seductive things; she had spent years looking at dresses and hair styles and being a bridesmaid at glamorous weddings. Then for some reason she never expected, none of that mattered anymore. She had done it in her head over and over&#x2014;the shoes, the jewelry, the music; she had walked down the aisle a thousand times and saw heads turning and heard the little gasps of approval.&nbsp; She felt a new kind of joy in knowing that she and Dooley would have something more wonderful than the grand wedding, the awesome honeymoon, the lingerie as ephemeral as mist.</p><p>&#x2018;We could even have a barefoot wedding,&#x2019; she said to Dooley.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;Wait&#x2019;ll y&#x2019;uns step on a bee,&#x2019; said Harley. &#x2018;Or one of them black snakes.&nbsp; That&#x2019;ll cure y&#x2019; of barefooted, I can tell y&#x2019; that.&#x2019;</p><p>She and Dooley had dug deep to wait through the last years of college and vet school.&nbsp; How would she direct herself while he focused on academics? Her art instructors had been crazy about her portfolio; they said she could go anywhere and do anything and so she pursued jobs in publishing, in advertising, and then in design, but wherever she applied, it was &#x2018;the economy.&#x2019;&nbsp; Here, there, everywhere, &#x2018;the economy.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;While Dooley was on a totally defined path, she was constantly trying to figure things out in a wandering sort of way.&nbsp; She resisted, without really understanding why, Olivia&#x2019;s generous offer to underwrite a graduate program in Art and Design at Pratt, which anybody in their right mind would go for if they could get accepted.&nbsp; She adored Hoppy and Olivia, who had given her everything including their name and their amazing love, but the answer was no and so there she went again, wandering like an Israelite. </p><p>What saved her in these final couple of years was teaching art to children at a non-profit in Chapel Hill, where she moved to be near Dooley.&nbsp; She had learned more from them than she could ever teach. It had been, in some ways, the time of her life, and she had loved each of them fiercely.</p><p>Perhaps she would teach again one day. But what she wanted now was to work with Dooley in the clinic.&nbsp; Though it was an estab...</p></p><h2>American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies</h2><p>It is a tale as familiar as our history primers: A deranged actor, John Wilkes Booth, killed Abraham Lincoln in Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, escaped on foot, and eluded capture for twelve days until he met his fiery end in a Virginia tobacco barn. In the national hysteria that followed, eight others were arrested and tried; four of those were executed, four imprisoned. Therein lie all the classic elements of a great thriller. But the untold tale is even more fascinating.<br><br>Now, in <i>American Brutus</i>, Michael W. Kauffman, one of the foremost Lincoln assassination authorities, takes familiar history to a deeper level, offering an unprecedented, authoritative account of the Lincoln murder conspiracy. Working from a staggering array of archival sources and new research, Kauffman sheds new light on the background and motives of John Wilkes Booth, the mechanics of his plot to topple the Union government, and the trials and fates of the conspirators.<br><br>Piece by piece, Kauffman explains and corrects common misperceptions and analyzes the political motivation behind Booth&#x2019;s plan to unseat Lincoln, in whom the assassin saw a treacherous autocrat, &#x201c;an American Caesar.&#x201d; In preparing his study, Kauffman spared no effort getting at the truth: He even lived in Booth&#x2019;s house, and re-created key parts of Booth&#x2019;s escape. Thanks to Kauffman&#x2019;s discoveries, readers will have a new understanding of this defining event in our nation&#x2019;s history, and they will come to see how public sentiment about Booth at the time of the assassination and ever since has made an accurate account of his actions and motives next to impossible&#x2013;until now.<br><br>In nearly 140 years there has been an overwhelming body of literature on the Lincoln assassination, much of it incomplete and oftentimes contradictory. In <i>American Brutus</i>, Kauffman finally makes sense of an incident whose causes and effects reverberate to this day. Provocative, absorbing, utterly cogent, at times controversial, this will become the definitive text on a watershed event in American history.</p><p>MICHAEL W. KAUFFMAN is a political historian and graduate of the University of Virginia who has studied the Lincoln assassination for more than thirty years. He has appeared on A&amp;E, the History Channel, C-SPAN, and the Learning Channel, and was called to testify as an expert witness in the 1995 Booth exhumation hearings. He lives in southern Maryland.ONE<br><br>&#x201c;By God, then, is John Booth crazy?&#x201d;<br><br> Good friday had never been a well-attended night at the theater, but on that evening, the city of Washington was in a partying mood. On Palm Sunday, General Robert E. Lee had surrendered his Virginia troops to General Ulysses S. Grant at the village of Appomattox Court House. Though some forces remained in the field, Lee had been the greatest obstacle on the path to victory. Now that his troops were out of the way, the bloodiest war in America&#x2019;s history would soon be over, and the celebrations had already begun. Four years to the day after its surrender, Fort Sumter was again under the Stars and Stripes. The flag raising there that day was marked with speeches, music, and prayers of thanks. There were prayers in Washington as well, but a lighter, more carefree atmosphere prevailed. There, buildings were &#x201c;illuminated&#x201d; with gas jets configured in the shape of stars, eagles, or words such as &#x201c;peace&#x201d; and &#x201c;victory.&#x201d; The city&#x2019;s population, which had ballooned to more than two hundred thousand during the war, had gone crazy. The streets were crawling with silly, drunken revelers&#x2014;soldiers back from the war, tourists passing through, and all the usual odds and ends&#x2014;staggering from one bar to another in search of a party and another toast to the military victors. All things considered, maybe this Good Friday 1865 was not such a bad night for the theater after all.<br><br>Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, on Tenth Street, was one of Washington&#x2019;s leading establishments. It had all the amenities of a first-rate playhouse. Its owner, John T. Ford, presented the finest talent the American stage had to offer. The audience that turned out this night made up a pretty fair cross section of Washington society: clerks, businessmen, politicians, tourists. And of course, there were soldiers. An ever-present part of life in the capital, they came to Ford&#x2019;s from every camp, fort, and hospital in the area, their dark blue uniforms scattered among the hoopskirts and crinolines. Some wore the light blue of the Veterans&#x2019; Reserve Corps, whose members once served in the ranks but were no longer suited for combat or strenuous duty. Here, they mingled comfortably with socialites, power brokers, and people from all walks of life. It was a diverse crowd, but nearly everyone had something in common, which explained, in large measure, the need to be in a house of entertainment on such a holy day: these people had been through hell.<br><br>One could hardly name an event in recent history that someone in this audience had not witnessed. Here were the veterans of Bull Run, Shiloh, and Gettysburg; the political warriors who shaped the nation; and the commercial giants of the age. One man had survived the horrors of Andersonville prison, and others had just arrived from Appomattox. This was more than just a &#x201c;large and fashionable audience&#x201d;; the people who came to Ford&#x2019;s Theatre that night had already been eyewitnesses to history. No doubt they were eager to get back to an ordinary life.<br><br>The play was Our American Cousin, a popular British comedy from the 1850s. Its humor was derived from the homespun &#x201c;Yankeeisms&#x201d; of Asa Trenchard, a backwoods Vermonter, and the physical eccentricities of Lord Dundreary, a self-important British nobleman. The star was Laura Keene, a London native, whose character, Florence Trenchard, believes that her cousin Asa (played by actor Harry Hawk) has just inherited the family fortune. Florence and her British relatives try to stay in Asa&#x2019;s good graces, but find it difficult to overlook his crass country-boy manners. It is this culture clash that carries the play.<br><br>For most of the audience that night, however, Our American Cousin was not the main attraction. A notice in that day&#x2019;s Evening Star had announced that President Abraham Lincoln and his wife would attend the performance. Their guest would be Ulysses S. Grant, lieutenant general of the army, victor of the recent war, hero of the hour. Their surprise reserva- tion had come in that morning, and it sent Harry Clay Ford, brother of the theater&#x2019;s owner, on a mad dash to organize a special program. A patriotic song called &#x201c;Honor to Our Soldiers&#x201d; was written for the occasion, and Ford sent notices of it to the Evening Star. He even redesigned the evening&#x2019;s playbill to reflect the new developments. By late afternoon, the reservations were rolling in. A normally dismal night was now showing some promise. By curtain time, at eight o&#x2019;clock, Ford&#x2019;s Theatre had a fairly good house.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln was famously fond of the theater, and had passed many an evening at Ford&#x2019;s or its competitor, the National. At Ford&#x2019;s, he always occupied the same box, on the right side, directly above the stage. It was an oddly shaped space with sharp angles and cramped, narrow corners, accessible only through a narrow passageway just off the balcony. It actually consisted of two boxes, numbered 7 and 8, which were normally divided by a partition. Stagehands set aside the divider and brought in more comfortable furniture to fill the space. For the president, a large walnut rocker, upholstered in burgundy damask, was placed in the corner nearest the door. A matching sofa went along the rear wall of the box, and the third piece, a large, comfortable armchair, was placed in the &#x201c;upstage&#x201d; corner, farthest from the door. The box had just enough space for those chairs, plus a small one for Mrs. Lincoln.<br><br>American flags were hung on either side, and two more were draped over the front balustrade. The blue standard of the Treasury Guards hung on a staff in the center, just above a gilt-framed portrait of George Washington. The flags added more than just a festive dash of color. They let everyone know where to look for the hero of Appomattox. Make no mistake about it: General Grant, and not Lincoln, was the evening&#x2019;s chief attraction.<br><br>James P. Ferguson was keeping an eye out for the general. Ferguson owned a saloon next door to the theater, and he always made a point of attending when the president was there. But he took a particular interest in Ulysses S. Grant, whom he claimed to have known since boyhood. When Harry Ford told him that Grant was coming, Ferguson bought two tickets for the dress circle, or first balcony, with a clear view into the box directly opposite. With the best seats in the house, &#x201c;Fergy&#x201d; brought along his young sweetheart so she could see the general as well.<br><br>They were in for a disappointment. General Grant had taken an afternoon train home to Burlington, New Jersey. A young couple came to the theater in his place. The presidential party arrived late, and as they appeared in the dress circle, the audience burst into a long, spontaneous ovation. The president acknowledged the approbation with a smile, then took his seat, partly hidden behind a flag. Miss Clara Harris took a seat at the far side of the box, and her fianc�, Major Henry Rathbone, sat on the sofa just behind her. Though Grant&#x2019;s absence was a disappointment, many in the audience assumed he would appear later. Ferguson, for one, kept a lookout for him.<br><br>By ten-fifteen, Our American Cousin had progressed to the second scene of the third act. Asa Trenchard had just told a woman named Mrs. Mountchessington that he hadn&#x2019;t inherited a fortune after all, as everyone thought, and the character (played by Helen Muzzy) had a change of heart about the marriage she had hoped to arrange between Asa and her daughter Augusta.<br><br>asa (to Augusta): You crave affection, you do. Now I&#x2019;ve no fortune, but I&#x2019;m biling over with affections, which I&#x2019;m ready to pour out to all of you, like apple sass over roast pork.<br><br>mrs. mountchessington: Mr. Trenchard, you will please recollect you are addressing my daughter, and in my presence.<br><br>asa: Yes, I&#x2019;m offering her my heart and hand just as she wants them, with nothing in &#x2019;em.<br><br>The president&#x2019;s guests seemed to enjoy the play. Miss Harris had been the Lincolns&#x2019; guest here before. Major Rathbone, of the 12th U.S. Infantry, was not quite so familiar to them. He had commanded a company under Burnside at Antietam and Fredericksburg. More recently, he had served as the head of disbursing for the Provost Marshal General&#x2019;s bureau. Henry and Clara had known each other since childhood, when her widowed father married his widowed mother.<br><br>Mary Todd Lincoln seemed especially pleased to make a public appearance that night. Sitting next to the president, she looked radiant in her flowered dress. She seemed to be enjoying a rare moment of happiness, her mind unburdened, for now, by personal loss and suffering. One lady in the audience noticed that Mrs. Lincoln smiled a great deal, and often glanced over at her husband.<br><br>The years had weighed heavily on Abraham Lincoln, and an occasional night out gave him a much-needed diversion. But even the theater did not free him from the weight of his duties. Twice he was interrupted by the delivery of messages. Charles Forbes, the White House messenger, brought one dispatch, then took a seat outside the entrance to the box. A newspaper reporter named Hanscom brought the other. Neither message seemed to require an immediate response, and the president settled quietly back in his rocking chair, head propped in his hand, looking lost in thought.<br><br>Though Lincoln was hidden from view most of the time, he occasionally leaned over the box railing to look down into the audience. That is how Isaac Jacquette, in the dress circle, got his first look at him. It was halfway into the play, and a woman sitting nearby remarked that she had never seen the president before. A man whispered that she might see him now, as he was leaning forward. Every time he came into view, the president stole the show.<br><br>On the far side of the dress circle, James Ferguson, still watching for General Grant, had borrowed his girlfriend&#x2019;s opera glasses for a closer view. He noticed a dark-haired man with a large black mustache walking toward the box from the rear of the dress circle. It was the actor John Wilkes Booth&#x2014;as usual, immaculately dressed and groomed. Ferguson watched Booth inch his way past a clump of people who had moved their chairs against the wall for a better look at the stage. Booth then stopped near the entrance to Lincoln&#x2019;s box and stood there for a moment, hat in hand, looking around.<br><br>On stage, Augusta Mountchessington realized she&#x2019;d been wasting her time with the American cousin. She left the room in disgust, and her mother turned to Asa. &#x201c;I am aware, Mr. Trenchard, you are not used to the manners of good society, and that, alone, will excuse the impertinence of which you have been guilty.&#x201d; She stormed off stage right, away from the president&#x2019;s box. Now alone on the stage, Trenchard said, half to himself, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know the manners of good society, eh? Wal, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal&#x2014;you sockdologizing old man-trap!&#x201d;<br><br>The actor Harry Hawk had turned to follow the lady off stage when he was startled by a loud pop. Spinning around, he saw a commotion up in the president&#x2019;s box. A man in black made a quick jerking movement, then stepped out of the shadows, his face glowing eerily from the stage lights below. The man stood there, wrapped in a veil of smoke, and hissed out the words &#x201c;Sic semper tyrannis!&#x201d; Then he suddenly vaulted over the balustrade and dropped to the stage more than twelve feet below. Landing slightly off balance, he rose to his full height, then raised a gleaming dagger triumphantly over his head. &#x201c;The South shall be free!&#x201d; he cried. With that he dashed straight toward Hawk, who turned and fled in terror. The man disappeared into the wings.<br><br>In the box office next to the lobby, Harry Ford was tallying receipts while ticket agents Joseph Sessford and Thomas Raybold talked with Laura Keene&#x2019;s manager. They all heard the gunshot, and Ford looked up from his tally. &#x201c;That was not in the piece,&#x201d; he said. The men exchanged puzzled glances, then made a dash for the window that looked out toward the stage. Ford reached it just in time to see a man rising to his feet with a knife in his hand. He looked familiar, but before Harry Ford could even form the words, Joe Sessford spoke for him. &#x201c;By God, then, is John Booth crazy?&#x201d;<br><br>John Booth. To those who knew him, this dramatic interruption did not make sense. Booth&#x2019;s late father had been known for his antics on stage and off, but his son had always tried to live that down. He had led a decent life, traveled in good society, and made a respectable name for himself. He was a longtime friend of the Fords, and disrupting one of their productions was entirely out of character for him. To Sessford, it smelled like a cheap stunt, nothing more serious than that.<br><br>Nearly everyone was slow to catch on. People in the audience thought something new had been added for the president&#x2019;s appearance. Some wondered if a piece of the set had collapsed, and one audience member even thought a pistol shot had been incorporated into the script. John F. Sleichman, a scene shifter, was standing backstage with James L. Maddox, the property man, when they heard the shot. Sleichman figured a part of the president&#x2019;s box must have collapsed. But when he told Maddox, the property man stepped into position for a look. What he saw instead was John Wilkes Booth darting across the stage with a knife.<br><br>A piercing scream came from the president&#x2019;s box, and in an instant everyone knew. To Isaac Jacquette, in the dress circle, that scream was like a slap in the face. A murder had been committed right in front of him, and neither he nor anyone else had done a thing about it. Edwin Bates, a businessman from Vermont, thought it was fear that froze everyone in their seats. &#x201c;The actors seemed no more to comprehend the matter than the audience,&#x201d; he wrote that night. &#x201c;Or they might perhaps [have] stopped the man as he ran right past them[.] If [only] they had not been intimidated by his dagger.&#x201d; In fact, the audience was full of men in uniform, and dozens of them were armed. One would have thought that after four years of war, somebody in the house would have recognized the sound of gunfire. But the element of surprise worked against them. A moment of hesitation was all the killer needed. As Charles Addison Sanford, a young student, put it: &#x201c;Everybody was confounded &amp; paralyzed . . . no one comprehended the moment. . . . Then all rose up trying to recover themselves&#x2014;imagining anxiously what it meant &amp; if the President had been assassinated. It was an awful moment.&#x201d;<br><br>Major Joseph B. Stewart was the first to react. Stewart, sitting in the front row, had just turned to say something to his sister when he heard the shot. He couldn&#x2019;t tell where the sound had come from, but looking around, he caught a glimpse of a man in black dropping to the stage. The knife in his hand told the story. At six feet five, Stewart might easily have overpowered the assassin, but he never got the chance. By the time he bounded onto the stage, the killer had already vanished into the wings. Stewart followed, but his path to the back door was blocked by a couple of bewildered actors who had wandered into the dark passageway. By the time he got outside, all he saw was the faint silhouette of a man struggling with a horse. Stewart took a swipe at the reins, but the man gained control of the animal, then turned it around and galloped into ...</p><h2>Plague Land: No Escape (Plague Land, 3)</h2><p><p><strong><em>In one week, the virus destroyed the world.

This book reveals, in the simplest way, how to still the mind and become fully present and awake in the truth of life. Perhaps the most important aspect of this book is the author&#39;s unique insight into the nature of the mind and ego. He describes in detail how the ego&#39;s resistance to Presence is the primary obstacle to awakening and how we can overcome that resistance in a simple and effective way. Each page of this book reveals a part of the mystery. There are hidden keys to awakening on every page. It is like a road map home.</p><p>Leonard Jacobson is a modern mystic and spiritual teacher who is deeply committed to guiding and supporting others in their journey towards wholeness. He has been running workshops and seminars for the past 25 years throughout the U.S., Europe and Australia. He is the founder of the Conscious Living Foundation and in 2005 he was awarded the Peace Prize by Religious Science International.Jacobson, author of four books, is a respected teacher, healer, and mystic. Journey Into Now, his newest publication, offers long-time travelers on the spiritual path and new seekers a detailed map to enlightenment and a clear description of what it will look and feel like when one gets there. Of special interest is his inclusion, at the end of the book, of his own very personal awakening experiences. Spiritual seekers need look no further than this book to find the inspiration, challenge, and direction needed to become a fully awakened Being.. --Kristine Morris, ForeWard Magazine<br><br>Journey into Now cuts through so much of the spiritual mumbo-jumbo that seems to accumulate in the hears on the path. It's not about the idea of being present, it's simply being present. What Leonard does in this book is step you through the obstacles to being present and give you exercises that lead you into the present moment. --Will Arndt, Producer and Director of What the Bleep<br><br>Journey into Now is a must read for anyone interested in becoming more fully present. It is one of the best books ever written about the nature of the mind and how to overcome the many and subtle blocks to awakening, including the resistance of the ego. It reveals in the simplest terms what the mystics and Masters have been speaking of for centuries. Simple and practical and yet profoundly mystical, Journey into Now is for those whose hearts and souls long to awaken. --David Welch, Producer of Peaceful Warrior</p><h2>The Hidden Lives of Learners</h2><p>The Hidden Lives of Learners takes the reader deep into the hitherto undiscovered world of the learner. It explores the three worlds which together shape a student&#39;s learning - the public world of the teacher, the highly influential world of peers, and the student&#39;s own private world and experiences. What becomes clear is that just because a teacher is teaching, does not mean students are learning. Using a unique method of data collection through meticulous recording - audio, video, observations, interviews, pre- and post-tests - and the collation and analysis of what occurred inside and outside the classroom, Graham Nuthall has definitively documented what is involved for most students to learn and retain a concept. In the author&#39;s lifetime the significance of his discoveries and the rare mix of quantitative and qualitative methods were widely recognised and continue to be one of the foundation stones of evidence-based quality education. This book is the culmination of Professor Graham Nuthall&#39;s forty years of research on learning and teaching. It is written with classroom teachers and teachers of teachers in mind. But realising time was short and that his life&#39;s work was laid out in learned papers for fellow researchers, he wrote this brief but powerful book for a much wider audience as well: for all those who seek a better understanding of classroom learning.</p><p></p><h2>Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935</h2><p>&#34;Philip Dru: Administrator: a Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935&#34; is a futuristic political novel published anonymously in 1912 by Edward Mandell House, an American diplomat, politician and presidential foreign policy advisor. His book&#39;s hero leads the democratic western U.S. in a civil war against the plutocratic East, and becomes the dictator of America. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms that resemble the Bull Moose platform of 1912 and then vanishes.</p><p>Edward Mandell House (July 26, 1858 March 28, 1938) was an American diplomat, politician, and presidential advisor. Commonly known by the purely honorific title of Colonel House, although he had no military experience, he had enormous personal influence with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson as his foreign policy advisor until Wilson removed him in 1919.<p>"...one difference between House and other authors of fantasy fiction was his attempts to put his principles into practice by insinuating himself at the right hand of power. Another was that House responded to political developments in terms of his own utopian fiction. Time and again in his diary House recorded events and related them to passages in Dru. Indeed, he was so pleased with apparent correlations that he later allowed his biographer to reveal his secret identity as Dru's author. His imaginary hero enacted tariff reduction, graduated income tax, and something akin to a federal reserve system, all of which became law under Wilson--without the dictatorship."<br> --Charles Seymour, The Intimate Papers of Colonel House, vol. 1 1926</p> <p></p> <p> </p><p>"House never lost touch with his fictional hero. For example, in March 1917, while ruminating over the probability of a U.S. declaration of war with Germany, House wrote in his diary, "Philip Dru expresses my thoughts and aspirations .... Perhaps the most valuable work I have done in that direction has been in influencing the president." Two months later he proposed that Britain allow America to take an option on British battleships after the war in return for the United States building destroyers to defeat the German submarine menace. While awaiting British approval, which never came, he wrote, "This plan touches closely upon the proposal I made in Philip Dru." In his book, the United States and England welcome Germany as an equal partner in an alliance, thus cementing "the comity of nations, a lasting and beneficent peace, and the acceptance of the principle of the brotherhood of man." This was certainly a far cry from the actual wartime situation in 1917."<br> --House Diary, 19 May 1917</p></p><h2>The Complete How To Handbook For Jewish Living: Three Volumes in One (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>In a clear and succinct step-by-step format, the Complete How to Handbook for Jewish Living answers innumerable questions on how to practice Jewish rituals and customs.

Building on the Quantum-Touch technique he developed in previous books, Gordon explains how the hands-on energy healing technique that he uses to help to alleviate nerve pain, headaches, back pain, hip pain, TMJ, and more provides a unique window onto the secret nature of matter. He explains how, by examining pelvic and occipital torsion, and then aligning people without the use of touch or suggestion, he is able to run a wide range of simple experiments that challenge many dogmas of science. This book teaches readers the technique along with 57 easy-to-reproduce experiments that allow them to test the results. These experiments clearly demonstrate that our consciousness can profoundly influence matter, and that an object charged with energy and intent can dramatically affect us physiologically in seconds.</p><p>Richard Gordon is recognized as one of the pioneers in the field of energy healing. He has been developing new healing techniques that are powerful yet simple and easy to learn, teaching them in workshops worldwide, and making them accessible to everyone in books since the mid-1970s.

Better yet, Gordon&#x2019;s process provides a scientific evidential path that allows scientists and laymen alike to unequivocally experience for themselves ancient wisdom and spiritual truths that reduce materialism to an irrational belief. What could be more useful and significant than that?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&#x2014;Thomas Campbell, physicist and author of <i>My Big TOE</i> (Theory of Everything)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Richard Gordon presents many convincing phenomena demonstrating that our consciousness affects the world around us. He shows the limits of materialistic thinking by outlining the paradoxes of quantum physics. In the &#x201c;double slit&#x201d; experiments, the presence of the consciousness of an observer changes the behavior of atomic particles. With infectious childlike curiosity, he then reports on a series of personal experiments. He charges objects like coins with healing intent, and finds that these are later able to produce postural alignment in others. Told with a warm and enthusiastic tone, Gordon provides mind-bending evidence that holds profound implications for the domains of science and of healing.

The Galahad, a faster-than-light spacecraft, carries fifty scientists and engineers on a mission to prepare Kepler 452b, Earth&#x2019;s nearest habitable neighbor at 1400 light years away. With Earth no longer habitable and the Mars colony slowly failing, they are humanity&#x2019;s best hope. After ten years in a failed cryogenic bed&#x2014;body asleep, mind awake&#x2014;William Chanokh&#x2019;s torture comes to an end as the fog clears, the hatch opens, and his friend and fellow hacker, Tom, greets him...by stabbing a screwdriver into his heart. This is the first time William dies. It is not the last. When he wakes from death, William discovers that all but one crew member&#x2014;Capria Dixon&#x2014;is either dead at Tom&#x2019;s hands, or escaped to the surface of Kepler 452b. This dire situation is made worse when Tom attacks again&#x2014;and is killed. Driven mad by a rare reaction to extended cryo-sleep, Tom hacked the Galahad&#x2019;s navigation system and locked the ship on a faster-than-light journey through the universe, destination: nowhere. Ever. Mysteriously immortal, William is taken on a journey with no end, where he encounters solitary desperation, strange and violent lifeforms, a forbidden love, and the nature of reality itself. ...HE DISCOVERS THE INFINITE.

The reader will find in it a fruitful source of prayer and meditation, as have so many people throughout the centuries since they were first revealed to the holy mystic and visionary. See also "The Revelations of St Bridget and Church Reform" and the edited "Revelations of Saint Bridget of Sweden: Books 1-5." St Bridget (or "Birgitta") of Sweden was born in June 1303 in the castle of Finsta near Uppsala in Sweden; her father Birgen Persson was the governor of the region of Upplan, her mother Ingeborga was also of noble lineage. Bridget married very early, had several children, and then in 1341, Bridget and her husband decided to celebrate their Silver Anniversary by going on a pilgrimage to Santiago of Compostella. This event marks a decisive turning point in the life of the two spouses, who for some time were already living their matrimony in chastity. During the return trip, Ulf, her husband, decided to embrace the religious life and was received into the Cistercian Abbey of Alvastra, where he died only a few years later. Bridget, having completed her mission as wife and mother, decided to transfer herself to an outbuilding to the monastery at Alvastra, where she remained for almost three years until 1346. It was the beginning of the most extraordinary phase of her life; after a period of austerity and of meditation on the Divine Mysteries of the Passion of the Lord and the Sorrows and Glories of the Virgin, she began to have visions of Christ, Who in one of these visions elects her &#x201c;Messenger of the Great Lord.&#x201d; To her spiritual directors, such as Fr. Matthias, Bridget dictated her famous &#x201c;Revelations,&#x201d; sublime intuitions and supernatural illuminations, which she had all her life and were then collected in eight volumes. Afterwards she went to Rome and here, under the dictation of an Angel, wrote &#x201c;The Hymn of the Angel&#x201d; or &#x201c;Angelic Sermon&#x201d;. It deals with twenty-one Letters to be read every day of the week during the morning Masses in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Saint Bridget, during one Eucharistic celebration, has a revelation of the Angels in Eucharistic Adoration: &#x201c;After the priest had pronounced the divine words over the bread, it seemed to me that that same bread took on three figures, although it remained in the hands of the priest. That Bread became a living Lamb, in the Lamb was seen the face of a man and on the inside and on the outside of the Lamb and of that face there was an ardent flame. As I was watching the face with attention, without averting my eyes, in it I saw the Lamb. And looking at the Lamb I also saw that same face in the Lamb. A Crowned Virgin was sitting with the Lamb and all the Angels were attending to her; the Lamb emanated a marvelous splendor. Also the multitude of holy souls was so numerous that my eyes could not contain it all, not in length, not in width, not in depth&#x201d; (Book 8, 54). Later on, the Saint is a witness to a conversation between Jesus and the Virgin about the creation of the world and of all things visible and invisible. Among these the Angels, who at the moment of their creation, in complete liberty, were given the choice either to accept God and His love, or to refuse Him.</p><p>Darrell Wright (translator and editor) received his Licentiate in Philosophy, magnum cum laude from the Angelicum University in Rome and is Co-founder of the Knights of the Holy Rosary.

The last several days spent fruitlessly pootling through rock passes &amp; in the blue shadows of ice cliffs, late afternoon under a flinty sky. The boy, not yet bloodstained, was watching penguins. He stared at little rock islands furred in huddled birds plumping their oily feathers &amp; shuffling together for comfort &amp; warmth. He&#x2019;d been giving them his attention for hours. When at last there came a sound from the speakers above, it made him start. It was the alarm for which he &amp; the rest of the crew of the Medes had been waiting. A crackling blare. Then from the intercom came the exclamation: &#x201c;There she blows!&#x201d;<br><br>An instant frantic readiness. Mops were abandoned, spanners dropped, letters half-written &amp; carvings half-whittled were thrust into pockets, never mind their wet ink, their sawdusty unfinishedness. To windows, to guardrails! Everyone leaned into the whipping air.<br><br>The crew squinted into the frigid wind, stared past big slate teeth. They swayed with the Medes&#x2019;s motion. Birds gusted nearby in hope, but no one was throwing scraps now.<br><br>Way off where perspective made the line of old rails meet, soil seethed. Rocks jostled. The ground violently rearranged. From beneath came a dust-muffled howl.<br><br>Amid strange landforms &amp; stubs of antique plastic, black earth coned into a sudden hill. &amp; up something clawed. Such a great &amp; dark beast.<br><br>Soaring from its burrow in a clod-cloud &amp; explosion it came. A monster. It roared, it soared, into the air. It hung a crazy moment at the apex of its leap. As if surveying. As if to draw attention to its very size. Crashed at last back down through the topsoil &amp; disappeared into the below.<br><br>The moldywarpe had breached.<br><br>Of all the gapers on the Medes none gaped harder than Sham. Shamus Yes ap Soorap. Big lumpy young man. Thickset, not always unclumsy, his brown hair kept short &amp; out of trouble. Gripping a porthole, penguins forgotten, face like a light-hungry sunflower poking out of the cabin. In the distance the mole was racing through shallow earth, a yard below the surface. Sham watched the buckle in the tundra, his heart clattering like wheels on tracks.<br><br>No, this was not the first moldywarpe he&#x2019;d seen. Labours, as their playful groups were called, of dog-sized specimens constantly dug in Streggeye Bay. The earth between the iron &amp; ties of the harbour was always studded with their mounds &amp; backs. He&#x2019;d seen pups of bigger species, too, miserable in earthtanks, brought back by hunters for Stonefacemas Eve; baby bottletop moldywarpes &amp; moonpanther moldywarpes &amp; wriggly tarfoot moldywarpes. But the great, really great, the greatest animals, Sham ap Soorap had seen only in pictures, during Hunt Studies.<br><br>He had been made to memorise a poemlike list of the moldywarpe&#x2019;s other names&#x2014;underminer, talpa, muldvarp, mole. Had seen ill-exposed flatographs &amp; etchings of the grandest animals. Stick-figure humans were drawn to scale cowering by the killer, the star-nosed, the ridged moldywarpe. &amp; on one last much-fingered page, a page that concertinaed out to make its point about size, had been a leviathan, dwarfing the specklike person-scribble by it. The great southern moldywarpe, Talpa ferox rex. That was the ploughing animal ahead. Sham shivered.<br><br>The ground &amp; rails were grey as the sky. Near the horizon, a nose bigger than him broke earth again. It made its molehill by what for a moment Sham thought a dead tree, then realised was some rust-furred metal strut toppled in long-gone ages, up-poking like the leg of a dead beetle god. Even so deep in the chill &amp; wastes, there was salvage.<br><br>Trainspeople hung from the Medes&#x2019;s caboose, swayed between carriages &amp; from viewing platforms, tamping out footstep urgency over Sham&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Yes yes yes, Captain . . .&#x201d;: the voice of Sunder Nabby, lookout, blurted from the speakers. Captain must have walkie-talkied a question &amp; Nabby must have forgotten to switch to private. He broadcast his answer to the train, through chattering teeth &amp; a thick Pittman accent. &#x201c;Big boar, Captain. Lots of meat, fat, fur. Look at the speed on him . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The track angled, the Medes veered, the wind fed Sham a mouthful of diesely air. He spat into railside scrub. &#x201c;Eh? Well . . . it&#x2019;s black, Captain,&#x201d; Nabby said in answer to some unheard query. &#x201c;Of course. Good dark moldywarpe black.&#x201d;<br><br>A pause. The whole train seemed embarrassed. Then: &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; That was a new voice. Captain Abacat Naphi had patched in. &#x201c;Attention. Moldywarpe. You&#x2019;ve seen it. Brakers, switchers: to stations. Harpoonists: ready. Stand by to launch carts. Increase speed.&#x201d;<br><br>The Medes accelerated. Sham tried to listen through his feet, as he&#x2019;d been taught. A shift, he decided, from shrashshaa to drag&#x2019;ndragun. He was learning the clatternames.<br><br>&#x201c;How goes treatment?&#x201d;<br><br>Sham spun. Dr. Lish Fremlo stared at him from the cabin threshold. Thin, ageing, energetic, gnarled as the windblown rocks, the doctor watched Sham from beneath a shag of gun-coloured hair. Oh Stonefaces preserve me, Sham thought, how bleeding long have you been there? Fremlo eyed a spread of wooden-&amp;-cloth innards that Sham had lifted from the hollow belly of a manikin, that he should by now certainly have labelled &amp; replaced, &amp; that were still all over the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing it, Doctor,&#x201d; Sham said. &#x201c;I got a little . . . there was . . .&#x201d; He stuffed bits back within the model.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Fremlo winced at the fresh cuts Sham had doodled with his penknife in the model&#x2019;s skin. &#x201c;What unholy condition are you giving that poor thing, Sham ap Soorap? I should perhaps intervene.&#x201d; The doctor put up a peremptory finger. Spoke not unkindly, in that distinct sonorous voice. &#x201c;Student life is not scintillating, I know. Two things you&#x2019;d best learn. One is to&#x201d;&#x2014;Fremlo made a gentle motion&#x2014;&#x201c;to calm down. &amp; another is what you can get away with. This is the first great southern of this trip, &amp; that means your first ever. No one, including me, gives a trainmonkey&#x2019;s gonads if you&#x2019;re practicing right now.&#x201d;<br><br>Sham&#x2019;s heart accelerated.<br><br>&#x201c;Go,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;Just stay out of the way.&#x201d;<br><br>Sham gasped at the cold. Most of the crew wore furs. Even Rye Shossunder, passing him with a peremptory glance, had a decent rabbitskin jerkin. Rye was younger &amp; , as cabin boy, technically even lower in the Medes order than Sham, but he had been at rail once before, which in the rugged meritocracy of the moletrain gave him the edge. Sham huddled in his cheap wombatskin jacket.<br><br>Crews scrambled on walkways &amp; all the carriagetop decks, worked windlasses, sharpened things, oiled the wheels of jollycarts in harnesses. Way above, Nabby bobbed in his basket below the crow&#x2019;s-nest balloon.<br><br>Boyza Go Mbenday, first mate, stood on the viewing dais of the rearmost cartop. He was scrawny &amp; dark &amp; nervily energetic, his red hair flattened by the gusts of their passage. He traced their progress on charts, &amp; muttered to the woman beside him. Captain Naphi.<br><br>Naphi watched the moldywarpe through a huge telescope. She held it quite steadily to her eye, despite its bulk &amp; despite the fact that she hefted it one-handed in a strong right arm. She was not tall but she drew the eyes. Her legs were braced in what might have been a fighting stance. Her long grey hair was ribboned back. She stood quite still while her age-mottled brown overcoat wind-shimmied around her. Lights winked in her bulky, composite left arm. Its metal &amp; ivory clicked &amp; twitched.<br><br>The Medes rattled through snow-flecked plainland. It sped out of drag&#x2019;ndragun into another rhythm. By rock, crack &amp; shallow chasm, past scuffed patches of arcane salvage.<br><br>Sham was awed at the light. He looked up into the two or more miles of good air, through it into the ugly moiling border of bad cloud that marked the upsky. Bushes stubby &amp; black as iron tore past, &amp; bits of real iron jagging from buried antique times did, too. Atangle across the whole vista, to &amp; past the horizon in all directions, were endless, countless rails.<br><br>The railsea.<br><br>Long straights, tight curves; metal runs on wooden ties; overlapping, spiralling, crossing at metalwork junctions; splitting off temporary sidings that abutted &amp; rejoined main lines. Here the train tracks spread out to leave yards of unbroken earth between them; there they came close enough together that Sham could have jumped from one to the next, though that idea shivered him worse than the cold. Where they cleaved, at twenty thousand angles of track-meets-track, were mechanisms, points of every kind: wye switches; interlaced turnouts; stubs; crossovers; single &amp; double slips. &amp; on the approaches to them all were signals, switches, receivers, or ground frames.<br><br>The mole dove under the dense soil or stone on which sat those rails, &amp; the ridge of its passage disappeared till it rose again to kink the ground between metal. Its earthwork wake was a broken line.<br><br>The captain raised a mic &amp; gave crackling instructions. &#x201c;Switchers; stations.&#x201d; Sham got another whiff of diesel &amp; liked it this time. The switchers leaned from the walkway that sided the front engine, from the platforms of the second &amp; fourth cars, brandishing controllers &amp; switchhooks.</p><h2>WOLVERINE: WEAPON X</h2><p>Wolverine's a lot of things to a lot of people, but to one infamous enclave he was nothing but a weapon.

And not all attempts to eat healthfully are bad. But crossing the fine line from normal eating to almost anorexia�even just a little�can be a big problem. When food and weight begin to consume your life, joy is often what gets cut out to make room for all of that obsessing. This was true for a young woman we&#x2019;ll call Emma. <br> <br> <b>Emma</b> <br> <br>Upon graduating from a prestigious Chicago arts college, 22-year-old Emma couldn&#x2019;t wait to move to California with her boyfriend, Sean, who had just been accepted to law school. A shy and bookish Midwestern native, Emma saw her relocation as the perfect opportunity to reinvent herself. She approached the Los Angeles lifestyle with zeal�adding blonde highlights to her chestnut brown hair, ordering vegan wraps at hipster cafes, and interviewing for countless jobs in her chosen field of journalism. But within a few weeks, she found herself second-guessing the move. Despite her impeccable resume, the recession meant fewer employment opportunities. Although she had a close-knit group of girlfriends back home, she found it difficult to meet new people without the predictable structure of school. Trying to hide her disappointment from Sean, Emma took a part-time retail job at a Santa Monica boutique and re-focused her energies on setting up their new apartment. <br> <br>Still on a student budget, she snapped up free but mismatched dinnerware online, and started eating from the only matching cup and bowl set. She didn&#x2019;t realize how important this ritual had become until one morning she bubbled up with irritation to see <i>her</i> cup, coffee-stained from Sean&#x2019;s all-nighter, lying dirty in the sink. Exasperated, she skipped breakfast. With Sean spending more and more evenings at the law library, their romantic evenings cooking over a bottle of wine dissipated into Emma microwaving steamed vegetables to eat alone in front of the TV. <br> <br>Though Emma considered herself lucky to be employed, she knew she didn&#x2019;t fit in with the other salesgirls at the boutique. The more she told them about her dream of writing, the more they questioned her commitment to sales. The only thing they complimented was her dietary restraint, calling her �tiny Emma&#x201d; and marveling at her �super-healthy&#x201d; lunches of carrot straws and hummus. Never having considered herself particularly thin, Emma stepped on the scale at home one night, surprised to see that she had lost 5 pounds from her 5&#x2019;5&#x201d; frame since leaving Chicago. Though the weight loss hadn&#x2019;t been intentional, gaining recognition for something�anything�after weeks of unsuccessful job searching, felt absolutely intoxicating. Determined to be worthy of her newfound �health nut&#x201d; moniker, Emma added new rules to her daily regime. She began eliminating snacks, measuring portions, and pushing mealtimes later in the day. When Sean took Emma out for Thai food to celebrate acing his first midterm, Emma vetoed the first restaurant in disgust because it didn&#x2019;t serve brown rice. Impressed with her self-control, Sean happily identified a more health-conscious restaurant where Emma could avoid white carbs. <br> <br>A welcome side effect of Emma&#x2019;s food restriction was the emotional numbness it provided. Although she had previously characterized herself as pensive and empathic��crying at the drop of a hat,&#x201d; her mom used to say�she felt increasingly anesthetized to her failed job search and growing emotional distance from Sean. The constant lump in her throat and knot in her stomach were replaced with a new sense of safety and calm. <br> <br>Her preoccupation with food, on the other hand, was maddening. Her valiant mental efforts did nothing to push away negative thoughts about the minutiae of her diet that bombarded her every moment. <i>Did I serve myself too many almonds at breakfast? I know I counted them twice� Can I wait until 3:00pm to eat lunch? If I eat too early, what will I do if I get hungry again and it&#x2019;s not time for dinner? �Should I have just one square of chocolate with dinner tonight? If I have one, will I be able to stop?</i> On some level, she worried that a number of her food rules were irrational�like eating even numbers of foods (e.g. 8 raisins rather than 7) and eating clockwise around her plate. But Emma felt compelled to follow them. <br> <br>By the end of the fall, she had lost 17 pounds and her period was intermittent. She couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time she had kissed Sean. Truth be told, she didn&#x2019;t feel very interested in much of anything. Except maybe food. When Sean broke up with her after finals, she had the surreal sensation that she was watching a scene from a movie. She knew that she should feel sad, but she felt nothing. As he admitted guiltily that he had met another woman�someone more �fun&#x201d;�she wondered absentmindedly whether she had put too much olive oil in their stir-fry earlier that evening. <br> <br>When Emma arrived at the O&#x2019;Hare airport baggage claim, her father gasped at her gaunt appearance. �Wow, Emma, you look�&#x201d; her father trailed off. Emma&#x2019;s face burned. �I know.&#x201d; Insisting that Emma see her primary care doctor for a check-up, her father accompanied her to an appointment the next day. <br> <br>Emma hopped off the scale and looked at the doctor expectantly as he made a quick note. �FEDNEC�weight not significantly low,&#x201d; she discreetly read. While she wasn&#x2019;t aware that FEDNEC stood for Feeding and Eating Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified, Emma did know one thing for sure. <i>I guess I&#x2019;m not anorexic after all.</i> She was surprised at her disappointment. <br> <br> <b>Symptoms of Almost Anorexia</b> <br> <br> <b>Frequent Weight Changes:</b> <i>Does your weight shift due to intentional attempts to drop pounds?</i> <br> <br>The hallmark feature of anorexia nervosa is being extremely underweight. Of course, not all individuals who are underweight have anorexia, but anorexia cannot be diagnosed without a significantly low weight. Emma lost 17 pounds in just a few months, but her weight at the doctor&#x2019;s office was not low enough for her to be considered severely underweight. This is because the anorexia diagnosis depends on an individual&#x2019;s final weight rather than his or her degree of weight loss. Someone could lose 10, 20, or even 100 pounds using unhealthy behaviors, but would only be diagnosed with anorexia if his or her final weight fell in the underweight range. As a matter of fact, recent drastic weight loss or frequent weight changes are a red flag for almost anorexia, since people without eating disorders usually maintain a relatively stable weight or slowly gain weight as they get older. Frequent weight changes often go hand in hand with other symptoms in the grey zone between normal eating behaviors and full-blown anorexia nervosa. <br> <b>Frequent Restriction:</b> <i>Do you regularly restrict food by amount or variety?</i> <br> <br>People with anorexia nervosa severely limit the number of calories they eat. On the flip side, those without eating disorders typically eat when they are hungry, stop when they are full, and allow themselves to enjoy occasional treats. Normal eating like this means that you don&#x2019;t have to eat all of the treats at once�you can choose to leave some for later. In this way, mild restriction would be considered a part of normal eating. Examples of food restriction that might be considered almost anorexic include attempts to follow rigid dietary rules like only eating at specific times (e.g., no eating after 7:00 pm), only eating a limited number of �safe&#x201d; foods (e.g., no white sugar or flour), and only eating a pre-set small number of calories (e.g., less than 1,000) per day. Remember that Emma was able to eat dinner with her boyfriend but refused to do so at a restaurant that did not serve brown rice; food restriction can manifests as limiting variety. In our society, there seems to be an ever-expanding list of ways to restrict food. (Isn&#x2019;t that ironic?) <br> <br> <b>Infrequent Compensatory Behaviors:</b> <i>Do you ever try to �make up for&#x201d; calories consumed?</i> <br> <br>Frequent or severe compensatory behavior is a defining feature of anorexia nervosa binge/purge type and bulimia nervosa. Compensatory behaviors include purging (self-induced vomiting; inappropriate use of laxatives, enemas, or diuretics) and non-purging forms (fasting, or excessive exercise). What all of these behaviors have in common is that they are intended to compensate for, or �get rid of,&#x201d; food that has already been eaten. Most attempts to compensate are just that. They are purely attempts and not truly effective for long-term weight loss. Individuals with almost anorexia may engage in these behaviors infrequently (a bulimia diagnosis requires weekly purging) or use milder forms of compensatory behaviors such as juice fasts, colonics, or cleanses. They also might exercise in a moderate but obligatory��I have to no matter what&#x201d;�kind of way. Even though Emma does not purge, her restricting and weight loss still place her in the grey almost anorexic zone between normal eating and a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. <br> <br> <b>Infrequent Binge Eating:</b> <i>Do you ever eat large amounts while feeling out of control?</i> <br> <br>You may be surprised to learn that eating too much can be a symptom of anorexia, a disorder that most people associated with eating too little. However, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa binge/purge type, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder requires frequent binge eating. Binge eating involves consuming a large amount of food (e.g., two boxes of cereal with milk; a whole large pizza; or all of this plus more) in a short period of time (e.g., less than two hours). Because we all overeat once in a while, a true binge also requires a sense of loss of control. Describing bingeing to her therapist, Jenni used to say, �I feel like my body is literally being taken over by somet...</p><h2>A Loyal Heart</h2><p><b>He&#x2019;s taken her as his prisoner.

Scrupulously biblical, but at the same time recognizing the value of Christian tradition, it draws extensively, but judiciously, on the insights of the early church fathers, the Reformed confessions, and federal theology, while remaining in constant dialogue with the world of contemporary theological scholarship. The overall organization reflects Letham&#x2019;s independence of judgment, and the end product is not only a Reformed systematic theology of enduring value but also an encyclopedic reference work for both historical and systematic theology.

His work is marked by a careful dialogue between the Bible and the great creedal and confessional traditions of the church, always aided and abetted by a panoply of great theologians from the past and the present.

Letham keeps his focus where it belongs&#x2015;upon the unfathomable richness of the triune God in his being and works. He expounds difficult topics in simple, concise prose, yet without being simplistic. Where Letham occasionally offers fresh formulations of doctrinal topics, he invariably does so in a way that is respectful toward more traditional treatments.

Not only pastors and students but also ordinary churchgoers will grow in their faith as they study a book with such depth and clarity of vision.

He starts with the doctrine of God and the Holy Trinity rather than with the necessity and sufficiency of special revelation. In this sense it may be said that he stresses the catholicity of Reformed doctrine and does justice to the place of natural theology in it, reflecting his own Trinitarian expertise. Letham&#x2019;s style is not only clear but also fair-minded, giving space to alternative views. Letham is good at the big doctrinal pictures and sensitive to the need to drill down at particular points. He judges between central and peripheral issues. He is to be warmly congratulated on this new book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul Helm,</strong> Professor of Theology and Religious Studies Emeritus, King&#x2019;s College, London</p><p>&#x201c;Robert Letham writes as no novitiate but as one who has given his life to understanding and explaining the Christian faith, addressing not only theologians and pastors but also the intelligent man and woman in the pew. I appreciate his contextualized treatment of topics, particularly his appropriation of historical figures often absent in confessionally Reformed approaches to theology. One may differ with him here or there, but I appreciate what he brings to many difficult matters, offering correctives to certain tendencies that even good Reformed thinkers might indulge. It is good to have one so thoroughly conversant with the history of the church, as well as the Bible, to write a systematic theology that resonates for our times as does this one. I heartily commend this new work to all. <i>Tolle lege!</i>&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Alan D.

It is meant to be faithful to the past and grandly succeeds in that intention. While Letham clearly embeds his theology in properly understood church tradition, he is not afraid to address current theological trends. The text is exceptionally well written, easily comprehended, massively researched, and a drink of cool water for those thirsting for more of God and his word.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Richard C.

The fact that I do not agree with everything in the book is part of what makes studying a systematic theology like this so humbling. We are pilgrims on the path to glory, walking in communion with the triune God and longing to see Christ as he is.

Extended throughout these chapters is the doctrine of union with Christ. Letham&#x2019;s Protestant account of theosis near the end of the volume, articulated as a perfecting of this union, not only culminates his book-long engagement with Eastern Orthodox authors and traditions but also goes a long way in addressing the need felt by many young evangelicals for thicker connection to early-church formulations and writings. Avoiding easy answers at every turn, Letham&#x2019;s contagious enthusiasm for the simple genius of the Christian tradition will inspire readers to live, believe, and preach Scripture more earnestly and fully.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Andrew Keuer,</strong> Professor of Theology and Ethics, Greek Bible College</p></p><h2>The Poet of Tolstoy Park: A Novel (Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>&#x201c;The more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death.&#x201d; Leo Tolstoy spoke these words, and they became Henry Stuart&#x2019;s raison d&#x2019;etre. <i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is the unforgettable novel based on the true story of Henry Stuart&#x2019;s life, which was reclaimed from his doctor&#x2019;s belief that he would not live another year.<br><br>Henry responds to the news by slogging home barefoot in the rain. It&#x2019;s 1925. The place: Canyon County, Idaho. Henry is sixty-seven, a retired professor and a widower who has been told a warmer climate would make the end more tolerable. San Diego would be a good choice. <br><br>Instead, Henry chose Fairhope, Alabama, a town with utopian ideals and a haven for strong-minded individualists. Upton Sinclair, Sherwood Anderson, and Clarence Darrow were among its inhabitants. Henry bought his own ten acres of piney woods outside Fairhope. Before dying, underscored by the writings of his beloved Tolstoy, Henry could begin to &#x201c;perfect the soul awarded him&#x201d; and rest in the faith that he, and all people, would succeed, &#x201c;even if it took eons.&#x201d; Human existence, Henry believed, continues in a perfect circle unmarred by flaws of personality, irrespective of blood and possessions and rank, and separate from organized religion. In Alabama, until his final breath, he would chase these high ideas.<br><br>But first, Henry had to answer up for leaving Idaho. Henry&#x2019;s dearest friend and intellectual sparring partner, Pastor Will Webb, and Henry&#x2019;s two adult sons, Thomas and Harvey, were baffled and angry that he would abandon them and move to the Deep South, living in a barn there while he built a round house of handmade concrete blocks. His new neighbors were perplexed by his eccentric behavior as well. On the coldest day of winter he was barefoot, a philosopher and poet with ideas and words to share with anyone who would listen. And, mysteriously, his &#x201c;last few months&#x201d; became years. He had gone looking for a place to learn lessons in dying, and, studiously advanced to claim a vigorous new life.<br><br><i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is a moving and irresistible story, a guidebook of the mind and spirit that lays hold of the heart.

Instead of putting on his hat, he placed the flat of his palm on his forehead and stroked the dampness accruing there. He sat down on the edge of the porch, quickly soaking the seat of his pants.<br><br>He rubbed his hands together and massaged the pain in his knuckles, then lifted his left foot and took hold of the heel of his boot and tugged it off. He straightened his back, took a breath, and in a moment crossed his right leg over stiffly and removed the other boot. Henry decided, because it was his option to do so, that he would abandon his boots. He paired them up evenly there on the boards.<br><br>Henry could not remember when last he had walked barefoot in the rain, mud squishing up between his toes. He believed it was Black Elk, or maybe Chief Seattle, who had said that the man who always wears his moccasins thinks the earth is covered with leather. Henry looked at his boots and wondered how long they would sit before someone took them. They were good Wellingtons and not badly worn, and he thought someone would be surprised to find a pair of boots on the porch at Dr. Belton&#x2019;s place.<br><br>Henry planted his palms on his knees, caressed the wet brown twill trousers, and from those points levered himself to standing. He would let his feet know that this piece of earth was covered with mud, and thought perhaps they&#x2019;d enjoy knowing that.<br><br>He tilted his face downward and was lifting his rumpled and sweat-stained felt hat when he heard his name called and, looking up, saw a horse and wagon drawing near the plank sidewalk in front of which he stood. Twenty years earlier in Nampa, Idaho, the first automobile had been delivered on a flat train car. Now in 1925 the tables were turned and only a few stubborn sorts still went about in horse-drawn carriages or wagons. This driver was among them. He sat alone on the buckboard seat, the long leather reins drawn tight in his gloved hand, making to stop his dappled gray Appaloosa. With his left hand the driver pulled back hard on the brake shaft.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa! Whoa back there, Bo,&#x201d; the driver said.<br><br>The horse slowed his walk, its hooves sucking at the muddy street, but did not come to a stop until the wagon was dead even with Henry. This side street was one of four remaining unoiled or unpaved streets in Nampa, and some of Dr. Belton&#x2019;s patients said perhaps the dust and mud was unsanitary, but the doctor disagreed. He did not like automobiles himself, and he owned the entire block, so the town council took their pavement and their oiling elsewhere for the time being. That kept at least some of the cars away, and the smell of oil out of the air.<br><br>&#x201c;How do, Brother Webb?&#x201d; Henry nodded to the man in the wagon, then raised his arm, hat in hand, and slowly wiped the top of his head with his shirtsleeve, depositing his hat there before dropping his hand to his side. His arms hung straight, his fingers loose.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you pray up this rain, Will?&#x201d; Henry was making small talk, postponing for a moment at least what was coming. But the Reverend William Webb had been dealing with people of all stripes for forty years, and Henry knew this preacher&#x2019;s practiced eye would discern that the news from the doctor was bad. Like as not, Henry&#x2019;s two boys had made such a prediction to the preacher man. Both his sons went to this preacher&#x2019;s church, Harvey, the oldest, a regular. We might as well go ahead and get on down to the quick on this one, Henry thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Henry,&#x201d; the preacher said, rain dripping from the brim of his hat, &#x201c;Thomas and Harvey have been telling me something&#x2019;s bad wrong with you. Said you&#x2019;ve been coughing and spitting up blood and you were coming in to see the doctor this morning. I watched you go in there, and I&#x2019;ve been lying in wait like a highwayman for you to come out. Now, I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Belton said it&#x2019;s consumption, Will,&#x201d; Henry said evenly. &#x201c;Tuberculosis. He&#x2019;s given me a year to live. Maybe not that long. Maybe a little more.&#x201d; Henry stood, like a patient man in line at a bank, his arms at his side. He was a tall man, just at six feet, and medium-built, his shoulders still square and his spine still straight. Nothing about him projected grave illness, and he could have passed for a man of fifty, though he was sixty-seven. His clear blue eyes locked on the dark eyes of the preacher, darker still under the soaked brim of his hat.<br><br>William Webb shook his head, then bent his face downward. When Will looked up, he said, &#x201c;I am sorry, Henry. This is a hard one, my friend.&#x201d; The preacher wrapped the reins around the brake, slid across the wet seat, taking hold of the seat back to help steady his rise. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll let me, I&#x2019;ll pray with you, Henry. Just a brief word with the Lord.&#x201d; A big redbone hound bellied out from underneath the porch, startling the horse into a quick forward step, snatching the wagon. The preacher lurched and fell back, sitting down hard on the wagon seat. &#x201c;Aw, Bo, damn your hide!&#x201d;<br><br>Henry smiled. &#x201c;Keep your seat, Reverend.&#x201d; He watched the old hound trot across the street, going diagonally toward the alley that would take him behind the Melton Hotel, and perhaps a scrap of bread raked off a breakfast plate. The morning fell darker, and there was a low roll of thunder toward the hills east of town, and the rain fell harder. Henry turned his collar up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you know when I need a prayer lifted on my behalf, though I do appreciate your intent, Brother Webb.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I at least give you a ride back out to your place? This muck&#x2019;ll ruin your boots.&#x201d; The preacher let his eyes travel slowly down to Henry&#x2019;s long bare feet. &#x201c;Well, that is, when you put your boots back on. I&#x2019;ve got to go in that direction, Henry, and I&#x2019;d not think a thing of carting you to your front gate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s to the Pearly Gates you truly want to cart me. I have known you for too long, Will. You&#x2019;ll never give up. You would talk all the way and make half a dozen altar calls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I expect there&#x2019;d not be time for half a dozen entreaties mean- ingful enough to rescue that starving soul of yours.&#x201d; Preacher Webb propped a booted foot on the buckboard&#x2019;s dash, caught the wet and wilted brim of his hat and tilted it back a bit for a better look at Henry James Stuart. &#x201c;I worry about you, Henry, staying away from the church like we&#x2019;ve got out a quarantine sign. Both your sons come as often as we open the doors. Don&#x2019;t you think Molly would want you in the church with her boys?&#x201d;<br><br>Henry braced his shoulders and closed his hands, though not tight into fists. &#x201c;Molly did want me to go to church. With her. And I went, glad to go for the pleasure it seemed to give to her. But, Will, Molly is dead three years now, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you have not darkened the door of my church one time since she passed, Henry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nor shall I, Will. We don&#x2019;t really have to talk about this again, do we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But do you not fear for your soul now that you&#x2019;ll soon face the Almighty?&#x201d; The preacher sat straighter, still holding up the brim of his hat.<br><br>&#x201c;My face has never turned away from God, nor my ear ever inclined away from his counsel. You do not stand between me and my creator, Will Webb. It seems a prideful thing to suggest, and a touch arrogant.&#x201d;<br><br>Preacher Webb took his foot from the dash and banged it down on the puddled floorboard, leaning forward to unwrap the reins. &#x201c;And you are the stubbornest man in all of Idaho, Henry. My prayer is that you get a chance to argue your name onto Heaven&#x2019;s roll, for you could argue the horns off a goat.&#x201d; The rain quickly eased and almost stopped, and both men looked briefly toward the sky, as if to find the cause of the lull.<br><br>&#x201c;Since you have got it going this morning, Will, let me argue with you for half a minute,&#x201d; Henry said, drawing his bushy white eyebrows together in a frown. &#x201c;Let me tell you how I believe that all the names of all the people in all the ages are written forever on that roll you speak of. How I believe that when our Maker claims what is his at the birth of a child and duly records it in his Book of Life, that little one becomes a divine property that neither foe nor force nor deed can steal.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry lifted his hands, a questioning gesture. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you get your preacher&#x2019;s heart to believe that what was ever once God&#x2019;s is always God&#x2019;s? It&#x2019;s simple to me. There is nothing that can oppose the creative force of the universe. There is nowhere to get to, Will, if you never truly left. It&#x2019;s because you and others of your ilk cannot even approach such an idea that I have no need of what you&#x2019;re selling at the churchhouse, Will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is your &#x2018;Everybody Gets Back to Heaven&#x2019; sermon. I&#x2019;ve heard it before, Henry.&#x201d; The reverend held the reins one in each hand, and was bent forward slightly with his forearms resting on his heavy thighs. &#x201c;Come on, Henry. What a load of bull. I don&#x2019;t know how they graduated you from Mount Union. Must&#x2019;ve been an off year for them in their divinity department to turn you loose among good Baptists.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry shook his head, but smiled. He had first laid out his theology to Will Webb on one of their fishing afternoons down at a favorite spot on Lake Lowell. It was after Aldus Sansing, a man well known to Henry, had been cut down with a double-barreled shotgun during a robbery and had died without officially &#x201c;coming to the Lord&#x201d; on a Sunday morning. Aldus never went there. Not for weddings and not for funerals.<br><br>His murderer was soon caught, and while he waited in jail to be hanged, he found his salvation, presided over and attested to by Reverend Orlen Estes. A grammar-schooler, thought Henry, could see something wrong with the killer getting his writ to enter Heaven while a good man had been murdered and tossed to Hell.<br><br>Ruminating upon that, in a moment&#x2019;s insight, Henry had come to believe that if indeed there was a &#x201c;next step&#x201d; after this trail is quit, then all and everyone is privileged to walk that walk. Henry believed he saw clearly the advance of all things. He knew that a boy who takes early to drinking and carousing is not left in some box marked 1907, but gets himself along to 1915 and a box labeled &#x201c;Loving Husband/Good Father.&#x201d; But then he might run off with the neighbor&#x2019;s wife the next year. And that was that. And it did not matter a whit, for all manner of things would in time be set right.<br><br>And Henry was at ease with his belief, but Henry&#x2019;s first son Harvey had told him to his face that he was hell-bound. Neither he nor his friend Will Webb could cotton to a simple line that all persons would perfect the soul awarded them, even if it takes eons. Neither could seem to comprehend the absence of a devil that could actually oppose and defeat the maker of the universe. For Henry, the debate was ended. And now, it seemed, he&#x2019;d be the first of the three to discover the truth of his religion. And that was well enough for Henry, who in apprehending the mix of sadness and exasperation on Will&#x2019;s face found his thoughts turning to Tolstoy. Henry had been read- ing and rereading the novels of Tolstoy since he was in his twenties, and had long studied his nonfiction. Henry knew that Tolstoy was a deeply spiritual man, and yet was excommunicated and therefore buried without the help of the Russian Orthodox Church. Some in Tolstoy&#x2019;s church, certainly his family and friends, must have been nonplussed by his disdain for organized religion.<br><br>The Reverend William Webb slid back across the wagon&#x2019;s board seat, making a swipe at the spot he&#x2019;d just vacated. &#x201c;Here, then. Put your boots back on, Henry, and hop up here and let me give you a ride home. Come on now, before this rain takes up again. I&#x2019;ll not preach a word in the direction of your black heart.&#x201d; The preacher gave an exaggerated wink. &#x201c;While we&#x2019;re riding you can tell me about this consumption, or what have you, that&#x2019;s fool enough to think it can kill you.&#x201d; Will paused, removed his wet right glove to accept the hand of his friend and help him onto the wagon seat, then said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not catching, I guess. Consumption, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>That got another smile out of Henry. He shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the contagious strain of the illness.&#x201d; Henry motioned with his hand to the preacher. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk, Will. And without my fine boots. It will be excellent practice for those long barefoot walks up in the clouds. But I do thank you for the kindness of your offer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now who is the arrogant one? Where do you come by the certainty that it&#x2019;ll not be red-hot coals you&#x2019;ll be treading upon, Henry? Down there!&#x201d; And Will Webb gave a thumbs-down toward the ground. Both men fell into laughter for a brief moment until Henry gave a deep raspy cough and turned to take from his unbuttoned shirt pocket a clean fold of handkerchief and coughed into that, putting it into his trousers back pocket when normal breathing had come again to him. Unguarded, muscles in the preacher&#x2019;s face now sagged downward around his eyes and mouth and the sadness was plain to see. &#x201c;I am mighty sorry, Henry. Mighty sorry.&#x201d; Will shifted both reins to his left hand and held his open right palm out toward his friend. &#x201c;May the peace of the Lord be with you, Henry.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry drew a finger to his hat. Will gestured a final time to the seat beside him. Henry shook his head no. Will nodded and slapped the reins. Bo pulled the wagon into the sloppy, gray-mudded street, and Henry saw Will draw himself down against the cold rain.<br><br>Henry spoke into the soft sigh of the morning. &#x201c;And also with you, Brother Webb.&#x201d;</p><h2>Invisible Jews: Surviving the Holocaust in Poland</h2><p><b>"A Holocaust story which must be read" &#x2014; "An amazing story of survival against all odds" &#x2014; "A simply incredible story of grit and ingenuity" &#x2014; "Needs to be on a mandatory reading list for every school!" </b> <br>Eddie Bielawski was born in the town of Wegrow in Poland in mid-1938. Not a propitious time and place for a Jewish child to be born. As a young child, he watched the Nazi army marching toward Russia. Day and night they marched &#x2014; soldiers, trucks, tanks, and more soldiers, in a never-ending line &#x2014; an invincible force. He heard his father whisper in shock, "Who is going to stop them?" <br>One night, Eddie&#x2019;s father had a dream. In this dream, he saw what he had to do: where to build the bunker, how to build it, and even its dimensions. It took him three weeks to finish the job. When he was done, he took his family into the shed and asked them if they could find the trap door. When they could not, he was satisfied. This would be their Noah's Ark, saving them from the initial deluge.<br>For three long years, starting in 1941 when the Nazis started the deportations and mass killings, Eddie and his family hid in secret bunkers that were dug in fields, under sheds, or constructed in barn lofts. It seemed that the only way that a Jew could survive in wartime Poland was to become invisible. So they became <b>invisible Jews.</b><br><b>"Inspiring to read of their resilience, ingenuity, and courage in overcoming almost unbearable circumstances.

So amazing and inspiring."</b> &#x2014;Virginia Cummings</p><p>Why did it take me all these years to write these memoirs? Canadian Jews in 1948 (when we first came to Canada) were reluctant to hear Holocaust stories, so we stopped telling them. Also, I didn't want our past to destroy my future, so I sublimated my feelings. Sort of "let sleeping dogs lie." But the "dogs" were not sleeping, they were only dozing. As time went by, I realized that at least my wife, children, and grandchildren should know our story. <br><br>At first I thought that there are so many Holocaust stories out there, one more would not make much difference. But I slowly began to change my mind. Every story is unique and must be preserved for future generations. Especially since the generation which experienced our near annihilation is almost gone, and the number of Holocaust deniers is on the rise.Born in 1938, <b>Eddie Bielawski </b>is probably one of the youngest Holocaust survivors with any memory of the war years. After the war, his family moved to Toronto. Within months, his English became almost perfect, and he learned to play baseball and hockey (although not very well), eat popcorn (which tasted like straw), and drink Coca-Cola (which tasted like cough medicine).&nbsp;Earning a B.A. in English and teaching certificates in English and the Theatre Arts, Eddie taught English in high school for 42 years, first in Canada and then in Netanya, Israel. Now retired, Eddie lives in Netanya with his wife Elaine. They have three children and ten grandchildren, all living in Israel.</p><h2>Seward: Lincoln&#39;s Indispensable Man</h2><p>The <i>New York Times</i> bestseller from one of the most acclaimed biographers&#x2014;the first full life of the leader of Lincoln&#x2019;s &#x201c;team of rivals&#x201d; to appear in more than forty years.<br><br>William Henry Seward was one of the most important Americans of the nineteenth century. Progressive governor of New York and outspoken US senator, he was the odds-on favorite to win the 1860 Republican nomination for president. As secretary of state and Lincoln&#x2019;s closest adviser during the Civil War, Seward not only managed foreign affairs but had a substantial role in military, political, and personnel matters.<br> <br>Some of Lincoln&#x2019;s critics even saw Seward, erroneously, as the power behind the throne; this is why John Wilkes Booth and his colleagues attempted to kill Seward as well as Lincoln. Seward survived the assassin&#x2019;s attack, continued as secretary of state, and emerged as a staunch supporter of President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln&#x2019;s controversial successor. Through his purchase of Alaska (&#x201c;Seward&#x2019;s Folly&#x201d;), and his groundwork for the purchase of the Canal Zone and other territory, Seward set America on course to become a world empire.<br> <br>Seward was not only important, he was fascinating.

A 17-year-old girl wakes up in what appears to be a white coffin&#x2014;surrounded by other 17-year-olds, half of whom are dead in their coffins. The macabre situation gets stranger because those who did survive can&#x2019;t quite remember their names or their histories, nor do they understand why they have strange symbols marked on their foreheads. Are they underground? Why is the tunnel they follow seemingly endless? And is anyone else alive? When they encounter another group of semi-adults, battles for leadership ensue, and those with the same symbols band together. But they are slowly becoming aware there is something else out there, and they will survive only if they stick together. Sigler balances the yin of high-octane shocks that come around each curve of the tunnel with the yang of Sun Tzu-like wisdom on tactics and leadership that have been mysteriously embedded in the mind of the main character, Em. As Em leads her survivors toward&#x2014;she hopes&#x2014;freedom, we stay on edge until the last page.

Full facsimile of the original edition. The &#34;Frontier Thesis&#34; or &#34;Turner Thesis,&#34; is the argument advanced by historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1894 that American democracy was formed by the American Frontier. He stressed the process-the moving frontier line-and the impact it had on pioneers going through the process. He also stressed consequences of a ostensibly limitless frontier and that American democracy and egalitarianism were the principle results. In Turner&#39;s thesis the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs. The frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking. Turner first announced his thesis in a paper entitled &#34;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&#34;, delivered to the American Historical Association in 1893 in Chicago.

Decreeing that the young couple had not tried hard enough to make their relationship work following the tragic death of their newborn daughter, Olivia's decision brings her to the attention of recent Cedar Cove arrival, newspaper editor Jack Griffin. And Jack's attentions are not entirely unwelcome for the long-divorced Olivia. In addition to her continued involvement in Cecilia and Ian's ongoing negotiations, Olivia's life is further complicated by her mother, Charlotte, her daughter, Justine, and her best friend, Grace, as they struggle with the difficult situations life tosses their way. Charlotte becomes enmeshed in trying to solve a mystery left to her by a mute stroke victim she befriends just before he dies. Justine has found the perfect man for her, one who shares her ambitions and thoughts on relationships, but why does she keep thinking about the boy she knew in high school who has grown into quite a man? And Grace's husband, Dan, has disappeared--again--and Grace has no idea where he is and when or if he'll be back. The multiple story lines and numerous relationships make reading at times challenging, but Macomber fans, old and new, will stand up and cheer as the prolific author lodges her protest against the disposable personal relationships all too common today. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>Debbie Macomber, with more than 100 million copies of her books sold worldwide, is one of today&#39;s most popular authors.

Astrologers throughout the ages have advised the powerful, from popes to presidents to royalty, and their influence can be seen as a hidden history behind the great events of the past. In <i>The Fated Sky,</i> historian Benson Bobrick writes the first serious history of astrology and takes a fascinating look at its origins and impact on human events. <br> <br> Astrology is the origin of science itself, as astronomy, mathematics, and other disciplines arose in part to make possible the calculations necessary in casting horoscopes. In earlier times, it was a science that won the respect and allegiance of the greatest thinkers and rulers of the ancient world, and eventually claimed adherents among the great astronomers of the scientific revolution -- Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton among them. Statesmen such as Churchill and de Gaulle consulted astrologers, and St. Thomas Aquinas thought astrology not incompatible with Christian doctrine. It is even said the Incas submitted to the Spanish conquistadors without a fight because their arrival coincided with an astrological prophecy. And astrology permeates our cultural consciousness, from references in the Bible and Shakespeare to expressions such as "ill-starred" or "lucky stars." <br> <br> Rich in historical anecdote and astrological lore, <i>The Fated Sky</i> shows us that while the true power of astrology may be open to debate, the belief in its power has been -- and continues to be -- an enduring and intriguing influence on history and the history of ideas.</p><p><b>Benson Bobrick </b>earned his doctorate from Columbia University and is the author of several critically acclaimed works, including <i>Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired </i>and<i>&nbsp;Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution.</i> In 2002 he received the Literature Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He and his wife, Hilary, live in Vermont.<b>Chapter One</b><p></p><p>America would never have been discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 had it not been for the thought of Arab astrologers in Baghdad in the 9th century A.D. When Columbus set sail on the great western voyage that carried him to America's shores, he had biblical prophecy to inspire him, Arab astrology to guide him, and various practical aids that three continental astrologers, who were also mathematicians, had supplied: the planetary tables of Regiomontanus; a map drawn up by Paolo Toscanelli; and an ephemeris prepared by Samuel Zacuto, who later made the splendid astrolabe of iron used by Vasco da Gama in his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. These were all of use to Columbus in his celestial calculations and his navigation of the open sea. He also used an astrolabe and quadrant to determine the altitude of stars, set his hourglass by the transits of the Sun, depended on the North Star to fix magnetic north, and judged the time of night by the constellation of the Great Bear. He overawed the natives of one island by his ability to predict a lunar eclipse, and drew with some success on astrological lore to predict the weather -- taking his ships to shelter, for example, in the port of Santo Domingo because an aspect between Jupiter and Mercury seemed to portend a tropical storm. Yet Columbus could not proceed solely by the sky. Knowledge of celestial navigation in Europe was wanting, and so, for the most part, he relied on a magnetic compass to measure his course or direction, and on his own method of "dead" or deduced reckoning to estimate his position on the main.</p><p>But it was the stars that led him on. Columbus understood that the world was a globe and believed that by sailing directly west he would eventually reach the shores of Asia (or the "Indies"). He could not know, of course, that America intervened. But it was not the fabled wealth of the Indies that held him most in thrall. For the voyage itself was spurred on by an astrological idea. That idea was the "great conjunction" theory of history, as first set forth in the writings of the Persians, elaborated by the Arabs, and adopted by the Latin West. Columbus had encountered it in the work of the French cardinal, theologian, and astrologer Pierre d'Ailly.</p><p>According to this theory, important historical events such as the rise and fall of empires, the birth of religions, and cultural transformations were marked by the "great planetary conjunctions" of Jupiter and Saturn as they revolved through their cycles in the sky. Such great conjunctions occurred once every 960 years -- a principal source of our idea of the millennium -- as the planets completed a circuit of the zodiac, combining and recombining in the signs. In the course of that round, the two conjoined -- that is, occupied the same degree of celestial longitude -- forty-eight times. For d'Ailly, human history was explained by the unfolding impact of these conjunctions, according to their scale. Shifts between triplicities or elements (earth, air, fire, and water, by which the signs of the zodiac were grouped) were associated with dynastic change; the greater or near-millennial conjunctions were linked to epochal change as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes and overwhelming floods. In d'Ailly's view, such great conjunctions had heralded or coincided with the Great Flood, the fall of Troy, the death of Moses, the foundation of Rome, and the advent of Christ. "All astronomers are agreed in this," he declared, "that there never was one of those conjunctions without some great and notable change in this world."</p><p>D'Ailly's work had convinced Columbus that the end of the world was near, and that it would be accompanied by the conversion of all heathenkind to Christ. For that reason, he called himself Christophorus (or "Christo-ferens," as he came to sign his name), "the Christ-bearer," and conceived himself the agent of God's work as the world approached its final days. All this he explained in a letter to his royal patrons, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. He wrote of the Indies: "These vast realms are peopled with immortal souls, for whose redemption Christ, the Son of God, has made an atoning sacrifice. It is the mission which God has assigned to me to search them out, and to carry to them the Gospel of Salvation." He took as his text Isaiah 11:10-12 -- "The Lord shall...recover the remnant of his people...and gather together the dispersed...from the four corners of the earth" -- and his historic first voyage itself seemed emblematic of that charge.</p><p>On the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail with three small ships -- the <i>Ni�a</i>, the <i>Pinta</i>, and the <i>Santa Mar�a</i> -- from Palos, Spain, and steered for the Canary Islands, where he reprovisioned before striking due west. After a difficult voyage of two months with a near-mutinous crew, on October 12 he at length sighted land. At two o'clock in the morning, a gun was fired to give the signal. All three vessels then took in their sails and laid to, "waiting impatiently for the dawn." Upon making landfall, "the voice of prayer and the melody of praise rose from his ships," and his own first action was to prostrate himself upon the ground. To Columbus, his journey's end was heaven-sent. For their part, the natives on the small Bahamian island were not wholly mistaken, perhaps, when they cried out at dawn to their brethren, "Come see the people from the sky."</p><p>Columbus would later say that he owed all he had achieved to the grace of God and "God-given" arts of astrology, geometry, navigation, and arithmetic.</p><p>His own heavily annotated copy of d'Ailly's work, <i>Treatise on the Image of the World</i>, may still be seen in the Columbine Library at Seville.</p><p>***</p><p>According to an ancient tradition, common to both Gnostic and Syriac Christians as well as to the Persians and Jews, Adam received the doctrines and mysteries of astrology directly from the Creator, and by knowledgeably scanning the constellations in the skies foretold that the world would one day be destroyed by water, then by fire. As a memorial to those who came after him, he (or his descendants, Seth and Enoch) had this knowledge engraved upon two pillars, one of brick, the other of stone. According to Flavius Josephus, the Jewish historian and near contemporary of Christ, the second pillar could still be seen in Syria in a.d. 63.</p><p>Astrology is the oldest of the occult sciences. It is also the origin of science itself. From astrology are derived astronomy, calculation of time, mathematics, medicine, botany, mineralogy, and (by way of alchemy) modern chemistry, among other disciplines. Logarithms were originally devised to simplify the calculations necessary in casting horoscopes; the ray theory of vision -- the foundation of modern optics -- developed from astrological theories of the effect of stellar rays on the soul. For five thousand years, from ancient Sumeria and Babylonia to the present day, the stars have been viewed as shaping, by divine power, the course and destiny of human affairs. Indeed, according to the <i>New Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, the earliest symbol of deity known to us -- the cuneiform sign for "god" -- was a star (*).</p><p>Astrological terms permeate our language: <i>conjunction, opposition, forecast, aspect, lunatic, venereal, disaster, influence</i> -- as in <i>influenza</i>, since all epidemics were once ascribed to celestial effects; we speak of "mercurial," "saturnine," or "jovial" temperaments; and people thank their "lucky stars," or consider a person "ill-starred" if his luck is bad. The Hebrew word <i>mazzal</i> means "sign" or constellation; so "Mazzal tov" (the colloquial "Congratulations!") really means, "May you have good stars!" The term <i>fall</i> is astrological, for the fall or autumn equinox marks the descendant of the zodiac year; and <i>revolution</i> is taken from an astrological calculation called a "solar return." The star-shaped halo that once encompassed the Roman emperor's posthumous image -- according to the belief that he ascended to heaven as a star -- was later transformed into the halo of the Christian saint. The pharmaceutical symbol Rx -- commonly said to be an abbreviation for the Latin verb <i>recipere</i> (from which we get <i>recipe</i> or compound) -- is derived from the ancient symbol for the Roman god Jupiter, based on the "Eye" of Horus, an Egyptian god with magical healing powers.</p><p>***</p><p>Astronomy studies the heavenly bodies in order to formulate the natural laws that govern them and to understand how the physical structure of the universe evolved; astrology describes the influence of those bodies upon human character and life. Or, as Ralph Waldo Emerson reputedly remarked, "Astrology is astronomy brought down to earth and applied to the affairs of men." It is an applied science, insofar as it is based on astronomy; an exact science, insofar as its judgments are based on mathematical calculations; and an empirical science, insofar as its deductions are based on data gathered over the course of time.</p><p>Its method is a horoscope, which is a map or diagram of the heavens cast for a particular moment of time, and read according to well-established rules. Those rules, if properly applied, are free from the elements of chance or divination; moreover, they are substantially based on a written tradition that derives its authority not just from dogma and belief, but from thousands of years of observation. The idea at the heart of astrology is that the pattern of a person's life -- or character, or nature -- corresponds to the planetary pattern at the moment of his birth. Such an idea is as old as the world is old -- that all things bear the imprint of the moment they are born.</p><p>Whether this is true or not may be subject to debate. But the belief that it is has proved to have enduring power.</p><p>Astrology in modern times has undergone a remarkable resurgence, and is now (as Carl Jung predicted it would) knocking again at the doors of academe. Astrologers are attempting to verify traditional doctrine by scientific methods and in general to meet the demand of Johannes Kepler (...</p></p><h2>Foam Roller Workbook, 2nd Edition: A Step-by-Step Guide to Stretching, Strengthening and Rehabilitative Techniques</h2><p><b>A full-color, step-by-step guide to end pain, regain range of motion, and prevent injury using the foam roller</b><br><br>With this helpful full-color guide, you can learn how to use your foam roller to remediate muscle strain caused by everything from sitting long hours at your desk to overdoing it at the gym.

On virtually every issue, from climate change to immigration, tens of millions of Americans have opinions and beliefs wildly at odds with fact, rendering them unable to think sensibly about politics. In <i>How America Lost Its Mind</i>, Thomas E. Patterson explains the rise of a world of &#x201c;alternative facts&#x201d; and the slow-motion cultural and political calamity unfolding around us.<br><br> We don&#x2019;t have to search far for the forces that are misleading us and tearing us apart: politicians for whom division is a strategy; talk show hosts who have made an industry of outrage; news outlets that wield conflict as a marketing tool; and partisan organizations and foreign agents who spew disinformation to advance a cause, make a buck, or simply amuse themselves. The consequences are severe. <i>How America Lost Its Mind</i> maps a political landscape convulsed with distrust, gridlock, brinksmanship, petty feuding, and deceptive messaging.<br><br> As dire as this picture is, and as unlikely as immediate relief might be, Patterson sees a way forward and underscores its urgency. A call to action, his book encourages us to wrest institutional power from ideologues and disruptors and entrust it to sensible citizens and leaders, to restore our commitment to mutual tolerance and restraint, to cleanse the Internet of fake news and disinformation, and to demand a steady supply of trustworthy and relevant information from our news sources.<br><br> As philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote decades ago, the rise of demagogues is abetted by &#x201c;people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists.&#x201d; In <i>How America Lost Its Mind</i>, Thomas E.

Why cookies? Why not cake, or meat? But that&#x2019;s what my subconscious chose as I dreamt. We were eating in the tiny kitchen of my Los Angeles apartment&#x2014;an apartment I didn&#x2019;t live in anymore, outside of dreams. The we were me, Princess Meredith&#x2014;the only faerie royal ever born on American soil&#x2014;and my royal guards, over a dozen of them.<br><br>They moved me around with skin the color of darkest night, whitest snow, the pale of newborn leaves, the brown of leaves that have gone down to die on the forest floor, a rainbow of men moving nude around the kitchen.<br><br>The real apartment kitchen would have barely held three of us, but in the dream everyone walked through that narrow space between sink and stove and cabinets as if there were all the room in the world.<br><br>We were having cookies because we&#x2019;d just had sex and it was hungry work, or something like that. The men moved around me graceful and perfectly nude. Several of the men were ones I&#x2019;d never seen nude. They moved with skin the color of summer sunshine, the transparent white of crystals, colors I had no name for, for the colors did not exist outside of faerie. It should have been a good dream, but it wasn&#x2019;t. I knew something was wrong, that feeling of unease that you get in dreams when you know that the happy sights are just a disguise, an illusion to hide the ugliness to come.<br><br>The plate of cookies was so innocent, so ordinary, but it bothered me. I tried to pay attention to the men, touching their bodies, holding them, but each of them in turn would pick up a cookie and take a bite, as if I weren&#x2019;t there.<br><br>Galen with his pale, pale green skin and greener eyes bit into a cookie, and something squirted out the side. Something thick and dark. The dark liquid dripped down the edge of his kissable mouth and fell onto the white countertop. That single drop splattered and spread and was red, so red, so fresh. The cookies were bleeding.<br><br>I slapped it from Galen&#x2019;s hand. I picked up the tray to keep the men from eating any more. The tray was full of blood. It dripped down the edges, poured over my hands. I dropped the tray, which shattered, and the men bent as if they would eat from the floor and the broken glass. I pushed them back, screaming, &#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>Doyle looked up at me with his black eyes and said, &#x201c;But it is all we have had to eat for so long.&#x201d;<br><br>The dream changed, as dreams will. I stood in an open field with a ring of distant trees encircling it. Beyond the trees, hills rode up into the paleness of a moonlit winter&#x2019;s night. Snow lay like a smooth blanket across the ground. I was standing ankle-deep in snow. I was wearing a loose sweeping gown as white as the snow. My arms were bare to the cold night. I should have been freezing, but I wasn&#x2019;t. Dream, just a dream.<br><br>Then I noticed something in the center of the clearing. It was an animal, a small white animal, and I thought, That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t see it, for it was white, whiter than the snow. Whiter than my gown, than my skin, so white that it seemed to glow.<br><br>The animal raised its head, sniffing the air. It was a small pig, but its snout was longer, and its legs taller, than those of any pig I&#x2019;d ever seen. Though it stood in the middle of the snowy field, there were no hoofprints in that smooth snow, no way for the piglet to have walked to the center of the field. As if the animal had simply appeared there.<br><br>I glanced at the circle of trees, for only a moment, and when I looked again at the piglet, it was bigger. A hundred pounds heavier, and taller than my knees. I didn&#x2019;t look away again, but the pig just got bigger. I couldn&#x2019;t see it happening, it was like trying to watch a flower bloom, but it was growing bigger. As tall at the shoulder as my waist, long and broad, and furry. I&#x2019;d never seen a pig so fuzzy before, as if it had a thick winter coat. It looked positively pettable, that pelt. It raised that strangely long-snouted face toward me, and I saw tusks curving from its mouth, small tusks. The moment I saw them, gleaming ivory in the snow light, another whisper of unease washed through me.<br><br>I should leave this place, I thought. I turned to walk out through that ring of trees. A ring of trees that now looked entirely too even, too well planned, to be accidental.<br><br>A woman stood behind me, so close that when the wind blew through the dead trees her hooded cloak brushed against the hem of my gown. I formed my lips to say, Who? but never finished the word. She held out a hand that was wrinkled and colored with age, but it was a small, slender hand, still lovely, still full of a quiet strength. Not full of the remnants of youthful strength, but full of the strength that comes only with age. A strength born of knowledge accumulated, wisdom pondered over many a long winter&#x2019;s night. Here was someone who held the knowledge of a lifetime&#x2014;no, several lifetimes.<br><br>The crone, the hag, has been vilified as ugly and weak. But that is not what the true crone aspect of the Goddess is, and it was not what I saw. She smiled at me, and that smile held all the warmth you would ever need. It was a smile that held a thousand fireside chats, a hundred dozen questions asked and answered, endless lifetimes of knowledge collected and remembered. There was nothing she would not know, if only I could think of the questions to ask.<br><br>I took her hand, and the skin was so soft, soft the way a baby&#x2019;s is. It was wrinkled, but smooth is not always best, and there is beauty in age that youth knows not.<br><br>I held the crone&#x2019;s hand and felt safe, completely and utterly safe, as if nothing could ever disturb this sense of quiet peace. She smiled at me, the rest of her face lost in the shadow of her hood. She drew her hand out of mine, and I tried to hold on, but she shook her head and said, though her lips did not move, &#x201c;You have work to do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; I said, and my breath steamed in the cold night, though hers had not.<br><br>&#x201c;Give them other food to eat.&#x201d;<br><br>I frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Turn around,&#x201d; she said, and this time her lips did move, but still her breath did not color the night. It was as if she spoke but did not breathe, or as if her breath were as cold as the winter night. I tried to remember if her hand had been warm or cold, but could not. All I remembered was the sense of peace and rightness. &#x201c;Turn around,&#x201d; she said again, and this time I did.<br><br>A white bull stood in the center of the clearing&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s what it looked like at first glance. Its shoulder stood as tall as the top of my head. It must have been more than nine feet long. Its shoulders were a huge broad spread of muscle humped behind its lowered head. The head raised, revealing a snout framed by long, pointed tusks. This was no bull, but a huge boar&#x2014;the thing that had begun as a little pig. Tusks like ivory blades gleamed as it looked at me.<br><br>I glanced back, but knew the crone was gone. I was alone in the winter night. Well, not as alone as I wanted to be. I looked back and found the monstrous boar still standing there, still staring at me. The snow was cold under my bare feet now. My arms ran with goose bumps, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure if I shivered from cold, or fear.<br><br>I recognized the thick white hair on the boar now. It still looked so soft. But its tail stuck straight out from its body, and it raised that long snout skyward. Its breath smoked in the air as it sniffed. That was bad. That meant it was real&#x2014;or real enough to hurt me, anyway.<br><br>I stood as still as I could. I don&#x2019;t think I moved at all, but suddenly it charged. Snow plumed underneath its hooves as it came for me.<br><br>It was like watching some great machine barreling down. Too big to be real, too huge to be possible. I had no weapon. I turned and ran.<br><br>I heard the boar behind me. Its hooves sliced the frozen ground. It let out a sound that was almost a scream. I glanced back; I couldn&#x2019;t help it. The gown tangled under my feet, and I went down. I rolled in the snow, fighting to come to my feet, but the gown tangled around my legs. I couldn&#x2019;t get free of it. Couldn&#x2019;t stand. Couldn&#x2019;t run.<br><br>The boar was almost on top of me. Its breath steamed in clouds. Snow spilled around its legs, bits of frozen black earth sliced up in all that white. I had one of those interminable moments where you have all the time in the world to watch death come for you. White boar, white snow, white tusks, all aglow in the moonlight, except for the rich black earth that marred the whiteness with dark scars. The boar gave that horrible screaming squeal again.<br><br>Its thick winter coat looked so soft. It was going to look soft while it gored me to death and trampled me into the snow.<br><br>I reached behind me, feeling for a tree branch, anything to pull myself up out of the snow. Something brushed my hand, and I grabbed it. Thorns cut into my hand. Thorn-covered vines filled the space between the trees. I used the vines to drag myself to my feet. The thorns were biting into my hands, my arms, but they were all I could grasp. The boar was so close, I could smell its scent, sharp and acrid on the cold air. I would not die lying in the snow.<br><br>The thorns bled me, spattered the white gown with blood, the snow covered in minute crimson drops. The vines moved under my hands like something more alive than a plant. I felt the boar&#x2019;s breath like heat on the back of my body, and the thorny vines opened like a door. The world seemed to spin, and when I could see again, be sure of where I was again, I was standing on the other side of the thorns. The white boar hit the vines hard and fast, as if it expected to tear its way through. For a moment I thought it would do just that; then it was in the thorns, slowing. It stopped rushing forward and started slashing at the vines with its great snout and tusks. It would tear them out, trample them underfoot, but its white coat was bedecked with tiny bloody scratches. It would break through, but the thorns bled it.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never owned any magic in dream, or vision, that I didn&#x2019;t own in waking life. But I had magic now. I wielded the hand of blood. I put my bleeding hand out toward the boar and thought, Bleed. I made all those small scratches pour blood. But still the beast fought through the thorns. The vines ripped from the earth. I thought, More. I made a fist of my hand, and when I opened it wide, the scratches slashed wide. Hundreds of red mouths, gaping on that white hide. Blood poured down its sides, and now its squeal was not a scream of anger, or challenge. It was a squeal of pain.<br><br>The vines tightened around it of their own accord. The boar&#x2019;s knees buckled, and the vines roped it to the frozen ground. It was no longer a white boar, but a red one. Red with blood.<br><br>There was a knife in my hand. It was a shining white blade that glowed like a star. I knew what I needed to do. I walked across the blood-spattered snow. The boar rolled its eyes at me, but I knew that if it could, even now, it would kill me.<br><br>I plunged the knife into its throat, and when the blade came out, blood gushed into the snow, over my gown, onto my skin. The blood was hot. A crimson fountain of heat and life.<br><br>The blood melted the snow down to rich black earth. From that earth came a tiny piglet, not white this time, but tawny and striped with gold. It was colored more like a fawn. The piglet cried, but I knew there would be no answer.<br><br>I picked it up, and it curled up in my arms like a puppy. It was so warm, so alive. I wrapped the hooded cloak I now wore around us both. My gown was black now, not black with blood, but simply black. The piglet settled into the soft warm cloth. I had boots that were lined with fur, soft and warm. The white knife was still in my hand, but it was clean, as if the blood had burned away.</p><h2>Talking about God: Honest Conversations about Spirituality</h2><p>&#x201c;And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way&#x201d; (1 Peter 3:15-16, NLT).<br><br><i>Talking About God</i> demonstrates that spiritual conversations have the potential to profoundly impact someone&#x2019;s faith journey, when we simply engage people with honesty and respect. For people who are intimidated or fatigued by the idea of talking about matters of faith, <i>Talking about God</i> offers story after gripping story about conversations that avoid offering platitudes and unnecessary divisiveness, and instead draw people organically and relationally toward the Good News of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Discover refreshing portraits of natural, authentic, God-directed dialogues that protect the dignity of the people we love and lead them into life-changing conversations.</p><p>Steven Saccone is executive pastor at Awakening Church in Silicon Valley. &nbsp;Cheri Saccone is a freelance writer and a registered nurse with a background in psychology.My friend Steve and his wife, Cheri, have written one of the most refreshing, thought-provoking, insightful, and practical books about building genuine relationships with people far from God that I&#x2019;ve ever read. In a world that is polarized and hostile when addressing topics such as sexuality, politics, morality, and religion, this book provides fresh wisdom and practical tools. It will help you break down the barriers and build authentic friendships with those whose worldview could not be more different from your own. I highly recommend it! (Chip Ingram, author and pastor)<br><br>I wish I had had friends like Steve and Cheri to patiently listen and speak grace and wisdom into my life as I journeyed toward Christ. The precious and sensitive conversations that they share in <i>Talking about God</i> are at once heartwarming and a road map for the posture and care that Christians have the privilege of offering to spiritual seekers. I love this book, and I&#x2019;m learning! When is volume 2 coming out? (Caesar Kalinowski, author of The Gospel Primer)<br><br><i>Talking about God</i> is a d�j� vu experience. You will find yourself thinking, <i>I just had this conversation with someone!</i> This is why this book is so important; it is so vividly real and not theoretical. You can now avoid the &#x201c;I wish I had read this before and had some ways to respond&#x201d; experiences&#x2015;because Steve and Cheri show how to respond to and converse about questions that come up in today&#x2019;s world. (Dan Kimball, author of Adventures in Churchland)<br><br>I have several reasons to love this book. First, it&#x2019;s honest. Steve and Cheri gain authenticity through their transparency in dealing with difficult subjects. Second, the power of story is unleashed: In their conversations with people about their life journeys, we find ourselves having conversations with ourselves and with God about our own pilgrimage. &#x201c;What would I have said and done?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How would I have reacted?&#x201d; inevitably lead us to discover something about our own beliefs and attitudes. Finally, I appreciate that this couple still understands who really is the Main Character in everyone&#x2019;s plot. (Reggie McNeal, leadership consultant and author)<br><br>I&#x2019;ve known Steve and Cheri for more than twenty years and have watched them live out what you will read on these pages. Through six unique narratives, they remind us that &#x201c;sharing our faith&#x201d; has never been about power or rightness, but rather about a reflection of Jesus that moves us toward honest and caring engagement. I hope these stories will inspire and educate you as they have for me.

His wife, Jane, has fallen out of love with him, and it is entirely his fault. Despite the shining example of his in-laws, Noah and Allie Calhoun, and their fifty-year love affair, Wilson himself is a man unable to express his true feelings. He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again. <br><br>In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters.<br></p><p>With over 100 million copies of his books sold, Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's most beloved storytellers. His novels include fifteen #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, and all of his books, including <i>Three Weeks with My Brother</i>, the memoir he wrote with his brother, Micah, have been <i>New York Times</i> and international bestsellers, and were translated into more than fifty languages.

Using strong characterizations, Wopat seamlessly switches from male to female roles as June grows to believe that her twenty-nine-year marriage is over. Instead of arguing when Lewis forgets their wedding anniversary, Wopat shows June's depression through sighs, half-uttered sentences, and flat tones. Lewis truly loves June, and, with the same devotion he gives to work, he now sets about winning back his wife. This intense love story portrays the dilemma of feeling taken for granted by the most important person in one's life and ends with a dramatic twist that brings a smile.

Molly is originally from 1935 but became Miri's fraternal twin in Miri's contemporary family (with two other sets of twins; one older, one younger) when they traveled through time. The girls travel first to 1918, where Molly meets her mother and wonders if she's supposed to prevent her parents from meeting in order to save her mother from dying in childbirth. But there seems to be another task in store for the girls. They travel to the 1860s, accidentally joined by their brothers, who are dressed as Union soldiers for a Civil War reenactment and are captured by Confederate soldiers. The girls must figure out how to save their brothers and return to their own time. The fast-paced plot is dramatically narrated by Cris Dukehart, with Southern accents, deep voices, or a snarky tone for villains and much lighter voices for the children. The narration accentuates the drama of the action and the children's contemporary language. Not all questions are addressed, however, leaving open the possibility of another time-travel tale.&#x2014;Maria Salvadore, District of Columbia</p><h2>Christmas Parade</h2><p><b>A delightful Christmas picture book filled with hilarious characters and dynamic art from the one and only Sandra Boynton!</b><br><br><i>BOOM biddy BOOM biddy BOOM BOOM BOOM!</i><br><i>What&#x2019;s that noise filling the room? </i><br>From this rousing beginning unfolds <i>Christmas Parade</i>, a merry picture book from Sandra Boynton<i>.<br></i>As the dynamic parade of forty-six spiffy and intent animal musicians marches by, young readers will see animals and their instruments in turn: chickens with bassoons, ducks with trombones, mice with piccolos, cow saxophonists, a tiny bird with a large tuba, a glockenspiel pig, even a trumpet-playing Santa rhino&#x2014;all underscored by marching snares (fifteen hippos, one cat) and one booming bass drum (an intrepid elephant).<br>Written with the irresistible rhythm of a lively marching band and illustrated by the author with those signature Boynton characters, <i>Christmas Parade</i> is a superb present for young children and families everywhere.

Three of her albums have been certified Gold, and <i>Philadelphia Chickens</i>, nominated for a Grammy, is nearing Platinum. In 2008, she was awarded the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Cartoonists Society.If it&#x2019;s true that everybody loves a parade, then why not have one at Christmastime? In Boynton&#x2019;s latest venture, a piglet hears the following noise outside his window: &#x201c;BOOM biddy BOOM biddy BOOM BOOM BOOM!&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the sound of the Christmas parade marching down the street, led by a bass-playing elephant in full-on band regalia. On each colorful spread, a new animal&#x2014;and new instrument&#x2014;is introduced, from silver-bassoon-blowing chickens to a drummer cat. Then there&#x2019;s a pause in the action before more animals enter, this time by numbers: one Santa rhino (sans beard), two cow saxophonists, three mice flautists, and four trombone-playing ducks. Little ones will appreciate the bouncy rhyming text, the large-type sound effects, and the charismatic cast&#x2014;and they may even learn to differentiate a trombone from a tuba. The long, narrow pages allow the parade to tromp gaily across the pages, and the ending plays up the Christmas theme nicely with the motley crew caroling at pig&#x2019;s door. Bring on the seasonal cheer.

[The American Mental Health Foundation's Fromm titles] are timely, directly relevant to modern psychological and social issues, and bring absolutely invaluable humanist messages to temper psychology's scientific and healing discipline. Highly recommended, especially for college library collections."<br><p>&#x2015;<i><b>Midwest Book Review</b></i></p><br>Fromm&#x2019;s follow-up to <i>Escape from Freedom</i> and <i>The Art of Loving</i> is a keen study of violence on a small scale leading to the specter of mass destruction.</p><p><b>Erich Fromm</b> (1900-1980) was a German social psychologist, psychoanalyst, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. He was associated with what became known as the Frankfurt School of critical theory. His best known work, <i>Escape from Freedom</i> (1941), focuses on the human urge to seek a source of authority and control upon reaching a freedom that was thought to be an individual&#x2019;s true desire. Fromm&#x2019;s critique of the modern political order and capitalist system led him to seek insights from medieval feudalism.

This is the story of the Army of the Potomac during that period: the initial enthusiasm dashed by sudden defeat at Bull Run; the pride at being shaped into an army by George McClellan and the frustration with his&#x2014;and his successors'&#x2014;inability to defeat Robert E. Lee; and, finally, the costly battle of Gettysburg, the decisive battle in which the First Minnesota played a crucial, and tragic, role. Drawing on a wide array of letters, diaries, and personal reminiscences, Moe tells the story anew through the experiences of the men who lived it. As James MacGregor Burns notes in his foreword, "Like Tolstoy's War and Peace, this work sticks close to the men in battle, and hence, like Tolstoy, the author keeps close to the human size of war."<br><br>Praise for The Last Full Measure<br><br>"Richard Moe, in this wonderfully told regimental history, manages to rescue that which Civil War studies so often neglects: the people."&#x2014;Ken Burns, co-producer of The Civil War<br><br>"Exceptional . . . a vigorous, haunting celebration of the Men."&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Regimental history at its best."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Highly recommended. . . . Thoroughly researched and excellently incorporating the soldier's-eye view of the war. . . . The best volume of Civil War historiography to appear in some time."&#x2014;Booklist<br><br>"A tribute to the men who helped save the Union. . . . If ever a regiment deserved to be remembered, it is the First Minnesota. . . . Richard Moe has a passion for history. He clearly also has a talent for writing it."&#x2014;Minneapolis Star Tribune</p><p>"This is Civil War combat history as it should be written. . . . The story of one of the war's best fighting regiments is told from the viewpoint of the men who did the fighting. . . . Both they and the author are eloquent without being orotund. The chapter on the First Minnesota's moment of supreme sacrifice at Gettysburg is the best thing of its kind that I have ever read." &#x2014; James M. McPherson, author of BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOMAs the first troops offered to President Abraham Lincoln after the fall of Fort Sumter, the brave men of the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment fought in virtually every major battle of the eastern theater during the first three years of the Civil War. From Bull Run to Antietam to Fredericksburg to their famed suicide charge at Gettysburg, these stalwart soldiers defended the Union and helped change the course of the war and their country's history. <p>Drawing on personal letters, diaries, and recollections, author Richard Moe tells a dramatic and unforgettable true story that follows the members of the First Minnesota from their early days as raw recruits through their seasoning under fire and by hardship. Of the thousand who had responded to the call to enlist in 1861, only a handful survived the war unscathed. Their voices, and those of their fallen comrades, enhance a masterful narrative that vividly recreates the glory and despair of a nation's tragic struggle.</p></p><h2>Ever</h2><p><p>Falling in love is easy . . .</p><p>. . . for Kezi, a beautiful mortal, dancer, and rug weaver, and for Olus, Akkan god of the winds. Their love brings Kezi the strength to fight her fate, and it gives Olus the strength to confront his fears. Together&#x2014;and apart&#x2014;they encounter spiders with webs of iron, the cruel lord of the land of the dead, the mysterious god of destiny, and the tests of the Akkan gods. If they succeed, they will be together; but if they fail, Olus will have to endure the ultimate loss, and Kezi will have to make the supreme sacrifice. </p><p>Newbery Honor author Gail Carson Levine has created a stunning world of flawed gods, unbreakable vows, and ancient omens. Her story of love, fate, and belief is spellbinding. </p></p><p><p>Gail Carson Levine's first book for children, <em>Ella Enchanted</em>, was a Newbery Honor Book. Levine's other books include <em>Ever</em>, a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller; <em>Fairest</em>, a Best Book of the Year for <em>Publishers Weekly</em> and <em>School Library Journal</em>, and a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller; <em>Dave at Night</em>, an ALA Notable Book and Best Book for Young Adults; <em>The Wish</em>; <em>The Two Princesses of Bamarre</em>; <em>A Tale of Two Castles</em>; and the six Princess Tales books. She is also the author of the nonfiction books <em>Writing Magic: Creating Stories That Fly</em> and <em>Writer to Writer: From Think to Ink</em>, as well as the picture books <em>Betsy Who Cried Wolf</em> and <em>Betsy Red Hoodie</em>. Gail Carson Levine and her husband, David, live in a two-centuries-old farmhouse in the Hudson Valley of New York State.</p>Good narration pulls listeners into a somewhat muddled story and creates heartfelt, likable characters. Jenna Lamia does an outstanding job with heroine Kezi, giving her a joyful lilt of loosely contained exuberance that has her dancing while others walk. Oliver Wyman, in the role of handsome Olus, god of the winds, is steadfast and strong. This tale will appeal to fans of classic mythology. The same shortcomings that have mystified us amid Greek and Roman shenanigans show up as a father&#39;s willingness to sacrifice his own daughter over a rashly made promise to the gods. But listeners will quickly get beyond that to adventure and romance as Kezi and her would-be savior, Olus, set off on their quest.

From interactions between the band and other stars&#x2014;Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, and Dennis Wilson&#x2014;to the chaotic animosity between band members, this memoir combines the sensational account of some of the world&#x2019;s most famous musicians with a thrilling love story.&nbsp;The parties, fights, drug use, shenanigans, and sex lives of Fleetwood Mac are presented in intimate detail and illustrated with never-before-seen photographs.&nbsp;With the exception of one brief interview,&nbsp;Carol Ann Harris has never before spoken about her time with Fleetwood Mac.</p><p><strong>Carol Ann Harris is a former recording engineer and&nbsp;model who is currently an A-list costume designer for music videos, films, and commercials. </strong>This is a fascinating if overlong look at the megasuccess of Fleetwood Mac in the mid-1970s, after the former British blues band recorded the laid-back rock songs of guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks that made the album <i>Rumours</i> one of the most popular of its era. While working at the band's recording studio, Harris, currently a music business costume designer, became Buckingham's girlfriend and constant companion from 1976 through 1984, and she gives a detailed look&#x2014;more so than drummer and original member Mick Fleetwood's biography&#x2014;at this already well-chronicled story of how the success of <i>Rumours</i> provided the income for extravagant cocaine-fueled excesses before, during and after performances. Harris too often uses clich�s, such as her view of the band's beautiful insanity. But she does candidly recount Buckingham's rage and his repeated physical assaults on her. Along the way, she offers great descriptions of the band's recording sessions, especially her account of Buckingham's desire to create something new, something completely different for <i>Tusk</i>, the more experimental (and less profitable) follow-up to <i>Rumours</i>. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Branson first leads readers through the foundations of Appreciative Inquiry and bracingly explores biblical texts for understanding the practice in a faith context.</p><p>Mark Lau Branson is Homer L. Goddard Professor of Ministry of the Laity at Fuller Theological Seminary and a consultant with The Missional Network. His other publications include Starting Missional Churches and Churches, Cultures, and Leadership.Many churches today are struggling to discern a hopeful future. The process of Appreciative Inquiry invites a community to identify what is most life-giving in its past and carry it forward. There is no better book on this topic than Mark Lau Branson's Memories, Hopes, and Conversations. This expanded edition is full of concrete stories of actual churches, biblical and theological insights, and even agendas and scripts to make the process easy and accessible. This is one of the most helpful books I know of for church leadership today. (Dwight Zscheile, Luther Seminary)<br><br>The original edition of Memories, Hopes, and Conversations was a major contribution to congregational studies and practical theology with its inventive juxtaposition of Appreciative Inquiry and the compelling stories of a local community. This revised edition, with its profusion of new narratives in dialogue with AI, cements its place as a visionary, modern day classic in ministries studies. Bravo! (Edward Foley, capuchin, Catholic Theological Union)<br><br>At last! Many of us have been waiting for this book. Grounded in solid theory and shaped by real-life experience, demonstrated in multiple stories of how leaders and churches are applying Appreciative Inquiry, Mark Lau Branson has not simply updated his original book but given us a new handbook for applying AI in our own contexts. I am particularly excited about the new stories that deepen the original theory behind AI. For the many leaders who have used the original book this is a welcome and expansive new resource. For readers new to the AI process and church leadership it is an important resource. (Alan J. Roxburgh, president, The Missional Network)<br><br>I have long had the hunch that there is more missional activity going on in congregations than meets the eye, and that reinvigorating a church&#x2019;s mission might have more to do with fanning the flame of what is already happening than bemoaning what&#x2019;s not happening. Now, Mark Lau Branson has proved me right. And not only does he reveal the impact that Appreciative Inquiry can have on church revitalization but he also shows it can help you fall in love with your church all over again. (Michael Frost, Morling College, author of The Shaping of Things to Come)<br><br>In this invigorating book, Mark Lau Branson and his colleagues prove Kurt Lewin's famous aphorism, "There's nothing so practical as a good theory." Drawing on the theory of Appreciative Inquiry in relation to congregational mission and leadership, Branson deftly guides the reader in applied research for the sake of participating in God's mission of mercy and justice for all creation. Branson's decades straddling the academic-ecclesial divide make his writing constantly provocative and useful for local churches seeking ventures both faithful and imaginative. This second edition includes not only revisions based on Branson's congregational consulting but also additional wise case studies from diverse leaders and congregations, aiding readers in taking up the process for themselves. Highly recommended! (Christian Scharen, Auburn Theological Seminary)<br><br>Wise, hopeful, practical, spiritually fueled, and abounding in grace, Memories, Hopes, and Conversations brings together theology, scripture, Appreciative Inquiry, and the realities of lived experience to create space for a gracious and effective process of discernment and action that any community of faith can engage. I wish every congregation in the synod I serve could have a copy of this book and use its wise and hopeful guidance to initiate, inquire, imagine, and innovate new ways of being God&#x2019;s people in the world. (Bishop William O. Gafkjen, Indiana-Kentucky Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America)<br><br>Memories, Hopes, and Conversations renewed my leadership vision as a local church pastor during a challenging time of leadership transition. Now as a professor teaching young church leaders, I find that the book continues to offer positive, life-giving processes for mission to arise from the people of God in local communities. The added stories and strategies of varied congregations in this wonderful revised edition further spark a holy imagination for the future of the changing church.

Drawing on the disciplines of history, anthropology, botany, archaeology, and the behavioral sciences, Jeanne Achterberg discusses the ancient cultures in which women worked as independent and honored healers; the persecution of women healers in the witch hunts of the Middle Ages; the development of midwifery and nursing as women&#39;s professions in the nineteenth century; and the current role of women and the state of the healing arts, as a time of crisis in the health-care professions coincides with the reemergence of feminine values.</p><p>Jeanne Achterberg, PhD, (1942&#x2013;2012) was a professor of psychology at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology (now Sofia University) and served as associate professor and director of research in rehabilitation science at Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.We must be fearlessly willing to manifest in our lives and healing arts what women have always known-the unity of being and the reality of the invisible spaces. We can neither exclude nor can we accept unconditionally and exclusively the products of the intuition and the products of intellect; instead we can unite these and all other polarities that characterize the myth that has divided us....Women healers can know power and compassion; they can, like the women healers of the past, be gentle warriors. There is no incompatibility here, but only wholeness and completion. <p> To say that the stereotypic witch-hunts were crimes against humanity misses the point. These were crimes against one-half of humanity that guaranteed that all women who chose healing as a vocation would be placed in the limelight of suspicion. The church fathers had predetermined much earlier that witchcraft was a woman's crime.</p></p><h2>The Winter Palace: A Novel of Catherine the Great</h2><p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY</b><br> <b><i>The Wall Street Journal � The Washington Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> From award-winning author Eva Stachniak comes this passionate novel that illuminates, as only fiction can, the early life of one of history&#x2019;s boldest women. <i>The Winter Palace</i> tells the epic story of Catherine the Great&#x2019;s improbable rise to power&#x2014;as seen through the ever-watchful eyes of an all-but-invisible servant close to the throne.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her name is Barbara&#x2014;in Russian, Varvara. Nimble-witted and attentive, she&#x2019;s allowed into the employ of the Empress Elizabeth, amid the glitter and cruelty of the world&#x2019;s most eminent court. Under the tutelage of Count Bestuzhev, Chancellor and spymaster, Varvara will be educated in skills from lock picking to lovemaking, learning above all else to listen&#x2014;and to wait for opportunity. That opportunity arrives in a slender young princess from Zerbst named Sophie, a playful teenager destined to become the indomitable Catherine the Great. Sophie&#x2019;s destiny at court is to marry the Empress&#x2019;s nephew, but she has other, loftier, more dangerous ambitions, and she proves to be more guileful than she first appears.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Sophie needs is an insider at court, a loyal pair of eyes and ears who knows the traps, the conspiracies, and the treacheries that surround her. Varvara will become Sophie&#x2019;s confidante&#x2014;and together the two young women will rise to the pinnacle of absolute power. <br> &nbsp;<br> With dazzling details and intense drama, Eva Stachniak depicts Varvara&#x2019;s secret alliance with Catherine as the princess grows into a legend&#x2014;through an enforced marriage, illicit seductions, and, at last, the shocking coup to assume the throne of all of Russia. <br> &nbsp;<br> Impeccably researched and magnificently written, <i>The Winter Palace</i> is an irresistible peek through the keyhole of one of history&#x2019;s grandest tales.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>The Winter Palace</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A majestic and splendidly written tale of pride, passion, intrigue, and deceit that is brought alive from the first page to the last.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rosalind Laker<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At the same time baroque and intimate, worldly and domestic, wildly strange and soulfully familiar, <i>The Winter Palace</i> offers a flickering glimpse of history through the gauze of deft entertainment.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A thrilling point of view . . .

This superb biographical epic proves the Tudors don&#x2019;t have a monopoly on marital scandal, royal intrigue, or feminine triumph.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p><p><strong>Tasha Alexander Reviews <i>The Winter Palace</i></strong> <p><b>Tasha Alexander is the author of the bestselling Lady Emily series. She attended the University of Notre Dame, where she signed on as an English major in order to have a legitimate excuse for spending all her time reading. A confirmed Anglophile from birth, she and her husband, novelist Andrew Grant, divide their time between Chicago and the UK.</b></p> <p></p> <p>Like most lovers of historical fiction, I&#x2019;m on constant lookout for a book into which I can completely disappear, one that will engulf all my senses and, in effect, turn my couch into a time machine. I want the history to be accurate, the characters to be compelling, and the story to make me reconsider preconceived notions about a period outside the area of my expertise. Eva Stachniak&#x2019;s <i>The Winter Palace</i> does all that in spectacular fashion.</p> <p>The scandal, luxury, and political unrest rife in eighteenth century Russia provide a rich backdrop, and Stachniak takes full advantage of all of it without sticking to the ordinary and expected. Instead of presenting Catherine the Great at the peak of her powers, she gives us the infamous empress during her youth, when she was Sophie, a young German duchess betrothed to the future Tsar Peter III. A not entirely welcome foreigner, Sophie is thrust into a court full of corruption and deceit, where nothing is more important than have a source of reliable information. It is by taking advantage of this circumstance that Stachniak gives her novel extra depth. Catherine is not the protagonist of <i>The Winter Palace</i>. Stachniak tells her story through Barbara, a young woman whose heartbreaking life has led her to employment as an ill-treated seamstress at the palace.</p> <p>Until someone realizes she&#x2019;d make a better spy.</p> <p>Stachniak&#x2019;s well-chosen protagonist enables her to give the novel a full and satisfying depiction of the Imperial Court, seen not only through the eyes of the privileged nobility, but through a woman who is keenly aware of what goes on above and below stairs. She brings to life the plight of the less fortunate and the delicate balance of truth and lies necessary to survive in the murky labyrinth of Barbara&#x2019;s world. Stachniak fills her novel with intricate details--the opulence is all but tangible--but never does so at the expense of her story, which moves along at a clipped pace. Her prose, lush and evocative, is as elegant as the fabled Amber Room at Catherine&#x2019;s summer palace.</p> <p><i>The Winter Palace</i> should secure Stachniak a place among the best historical novelists. It is one of those rare books that grabs the reader and won&#x2019;t let go, one that begs to be read again, one that lingers pleasantly in the mind long after the finishing the last page. And for me, it proved itself in a more simple way: the minute I closed the book, I wanted to get my hands on everything else Stachniak has written.</p><b>Eva Stachniak</b> was born in Wroc&#x142;aw, Poland.

What&#x2019;s a half-guy, half-girl to do?<br><br> Ten years ago, Ukyo made a special okonomiyaki sauce&#x2014;which Ranma secretly ruined. Unaware of what Ranma had done, Ukyo to this day can&#x2019;t quite understand why Ranma&#x2019;s being extra nice to her despite the phenomenal failure of her special sauce. Akane&#x2019;s onto Ranma, though, and one way or another he&#x2019;s going to pay.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi&#39;s career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan&#39;s annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.</p><h2>The Message Large Print (Leather-Look, Brown Trio): The Bible in Contemporary Language</h2><p>Enjoy the surprising clarity of <i>The Message</i> . . . with a font size to match.<br><br>This large-print edition of <i>The Message</i> is designed for anyone who prefers larger type for clearer, more enjoyable reading.<br><br><i>The Message</i> is a reading Bible translated from the original Greek and Hebrew Scriptures by scholar, pastor, author, and poet Eugene Peterson.

He lives near Toronto with his wife and has two grown children.<b>PROLOGUE</b><p></p><p>It was just by chance he turned down Orchard Street and saw the window when he did. It easily could have been a week from now, or a month, even a year. But it turned out that this was going to be the day.</p><p>Sure, he would have wandered down here eventually. Sooner or later, when he got to a new city, he hit every street. He always started out intending to be methodical about it&#x2014;follow one street from beginning to end, then head over a block and backtrack on a parallel street, like doing the aisles in a grocery store&#x2014; but then he'd get to a cross street and something would catch his eye, and all good intentions would be abandoned.</p><p>That was how it turned out when he got to Manhattan, even though, of all the cities he'd visited, it was the one that most lent itself to being explored in an orderly fashion, at least those parts of the city north of Fourteenth Street, which was laid out in that perfect grid of streets and avenues. South of that, once you got into the West Village and Greenwich Village and SoHo and Chinatown, well, it was chaos down there, but that didn't bother him. It certainly wasn't any worse than in London or Rome or Paris or even Boston's North End, and he'd loved exploring those cities.</p><p>He'd turned south onto Orchard from Delancey, but his actual starting point for this stroll had been Spring and Mulberry. He'd gone south to Grand, west to Crosby, north back to Prince, east to Elizabeth, south to Kenmare, then east, continuing along Delancey, then, when he got to Orchard, decided to hang a right.</p><p>It was a beautiful street. Not in the sense that there were gardens and fountains and lush trees lining the sidewalk. Not beautiful like, say, Vaci Street in Budapest, or the Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris, or Lombard Street in San Francisco, but it was a street rich in texture and steeped in history. Narrow, one-way, running north. Old brick tenement buildings, few more than five stories, many only three or four, dating back a century and a half. A street that represented so many different times in the city's history. The buildings, with their skeletal fire escapes clinging to the fronts, reflected the Italianate style popular in the mid-to late nineteenth century, with arches above the windows, stone lintels projecting outward, ornate carved leaves in the trim work, but their ground floors housed everything from trendy caf�s to designer dress shops. There were older, more conventional businesses, too. A uniform shop, a real estate agent, a hair salon, a gallery, a place that sold luggage. Many of the closed stores were shielded with drawn-down steel doors.</p><p>He meandered down the center of the street, not particularly worried about traffic. It wasn't a problem right now. He always found you got the sense of a place by walking down the middle of the road. It offered the best vantage point. You could look ahead or from side to side, or whirl around 360 degrees and see where you'd been. It was good to know your surroundings and your options, in case you had to make a fast move.</p><p>Because the building blocks of a city were his primary concern&#x2014;its architecture, its layout, its infrastructure&#x2014;he paid little attention to the people he came across in his travels. He didn't strike up conversations. He wasn't interested in saying so much as hello to that redheaded woman standing on the corner, smoking a cigarette. He didn't care what kind of fashion statement she was trying to make with her leather jacket, short skirt, and what looked like deliberately laddered black tights. He wasn't going to ask the athletic-looking woman in the black baseball cap who was darting across the street in front of him how she thought the Yankees were going to do this year. He never watched baseball, and cared nothing about it. And he was not about to ask why a dozen people with guidebooks sticking out of their pockets were listening to one woman in the center of the group, although he guessed she was a tour guide of some sort.</p><p>When he got to Broome Street he spotted an inviting-looking restaurant on the southeast corner with small white tables and yellow plastic chairs set up on the sidewalk. But there was no one sitting outside. The sign in the window read: "Come in and get warm." He went up close, peering through the glass at the people drinking coffee, working on laptops, reading newspapers.</p><p>Reflected in the restaurant's window was that car he'd been seeing throughout his travels. Nondescript sedan. Maybe a Civic. With the apparatus on the roof. He'd seen the car before. Many times. If he didn't know better, he'd think it was following him. He put it out of his mind and looked through the glass, into the restaurant.</p><p>He wished it were possible for him to go inside and have a latte or a cappuccino. He could almost smell the coffee. But he had to keep going. So much of the world to see and so little time. Tomorrow he had plans to be in Montreal, and, depending how much ground he covered there, maybe Madrid the day after.</p><p>But he would remember this place. The sign in the window, the tables and chairs outside. The other businesses on Orchard. The narrow alleyways between the buildings. Plus everything that he had seen on Spring and Mulberry and Grand and Crosby and Prince and Elizabeth and Kenmare and Delancey.</p><p>He would remember it all.</p><p>He was about a third of the way down the block from the Broome cross street when he made that upward glance.</p><p>That was really where the element of chance entered into it. It wasn't at all remarkable that he ended up on Orchard. It was the fact that he looked above the storefronts. He didn't always do that. He scoped out the businesses and read the signs in their windows, studied the people in the coffee shops, made a mental note of the numbers above the doors, but he didn't always cast his eyes above the first or second floors. Sometimes he forgot, and sometimes he was short of time. He might easily have gone down this street and never glanced upon that particular window of that particular tenement building.</p><p>Then again, he thought, chance might have had nothing to do with it. Maybe he was meant to see this window. Maybe, in some strange way, it was a test. To determine whether he was ready, even though he believed he was. But those who would make use of his talents&#x2014;they might need some convincing before taking him on.</p><p>The window was on the third floor, above a place that sold cigarettes and newspapers&#x2014;there was that car again, reflected in the window&#x2014;and a second shop specializing in women's scarves. It was divided into two panes. An air-conditioning unit stuck out from the sill, taking up half of the lower pane. Something white, above the air conditioner, had caught his eye.</p><p>At first, it looked like one of those white Styrofoam heads department stores and hair salons use to display wigs. He thought, <i>Isn't that funny, to put one of those in a window</i>. A bald, featureless white head keeping watch over Orchard Street. He supposed that in New York you could find just about anything in someone's window. If it had been his, he would have at least put a pair of sunglasses on it, to give the head some personality. A hint of whimsy. Although, he had to admit, people did not tend to think of him as whimsical.</p><p>But the more he looked at it, the less sure he was that it was a white foam head. The surface appeared more shimmery, slippery even. Perhaps plastic, like the bags the grocery stores used, or a dry cleaning bag, but not one of the clear ones.</p><p>He attempted to get a better look, zero in.</p><p>The thing was, this white, almost circular object in the window still had the shape of a head. The plastic material strained against a protuberance that could only be a nose. It hugged tight across what appeared to be a brow near the top, a chin at the bottom. There was even a trace of mouth, the lips open as though gasping for air.</p><p>Or screaming.</p><p>It was, he thought, as though a white stocking had been pulled down over someone's head. But the material's sheen still made him think it was plastic.</p><p>That wasn't a very smart thing for someone to do. To put a plastic bag over their head. You could suffocate yourself doing something stupid like that.</p><p>A person would have to be pulling on the plastic bag, twisting it from behind, to make it conform so tightly to the contours of their face. But he didn't see this person's arms or hands doing anything like that.</p><p>Which made him wonder if someone else was doing it.</p><p>Oh. Oh, <i>no</i>.</p><p>Was that what he was witnessing? Someone putting a bag over another person's head? Cutting off their air supply? Smothering them? Could this account for the mouth that seemed to be struggling for air?</p><p>Who was this happening to? A man? A woman? And who was doing it to them?</p><p><i>Suddenly he was thinking about the boy in the window. A different window. Many years ago</i>.</p><p>But the person in this window, right now, didn't look like a boy, or a girl. This was an adult. An adult whose life was coming to an end. That certainly was how it looked to him. He felt his heart begin to beat more quickly. He'd seen things before on his travels. Things that weren't right. But they were minor compared to this. Never a murder. That's what he was sure this was.</p><p>He didn't shout out. He didn't reach into his jacket for a cell phone to call 911. He didn't spring into the nearest shop and tell someone to call the police. He didn't charge into the building and race up two flights of stairs in a bid to stop what was happening behind this third-floor window.</p><p>All he did was reach out, tentatively, as though it were possible to touch the smothered face of this person on the third floor, to feel what was wrapped around his or her head, make some sort of assessment as to&#x2014;</p><p><i>Knock knock</i>.</p><p>Then, maybe then, he'd have a better idea what was actually happening to this person in&#x2014;</p><p><i>Knock knock</i>.</p><p>He'd been so transfixed by what was happening at the window that he did not, at first, realize someone was trying to get his attention. Someone was at the door.</p><p>He took his hand off the mouse, spun around in his padded computer chair, and said, "Yes?" The door opened an inch. From the hallway, someone said, "Get your ass down for dinner, Thomas." "What are we having?" he asked. "Burgers. From the barbecue." The man sitting in the computer chair said flatly, "Okay."</p><p>He spun around and resumed looking at the frozen image of the window on his oversized computer monitor. The blurry, white, wrapped head suspended there. A ghostly visage.</p><p>Had anyone seen this at the time? Had anyone looked up?</p><p><i>No one had seen the boy when he was in the window. No one had looked up. No one had helped him</i>.</p><p>The man left the image on his screen so he could study it more closely when he came back up after dinner. Then he'd make a decision about what to do.</p><p></p><b>TWO WEEKS EARLIER</b><p></p><p></p><b>O N E</b><p></p><p>"COME on in, Ray."</p><p>Harry Peyton shook my hand and led me into his law office, pointing me toward the red leather chair opposite his desk. About the same age as my father, he looked years younger than Dad had. He was six feet, trim, with a head smooth as a melon. Baldness aged some guys, but not Harry. He was a long-distance runner, and his expensive suit fit him like a second skin. His desk was a testament to orderliness. A computer monitor, keyboard, one of the latest smartphones. And one legal file folder. The rest of the desk was as clean as a canvas before the first brushstroke.</p><p>"Again, I'm so sorry," Harry said. "There are a hundred things one could say about your dad, but Reverend Clayton summed it up nicely. Adam Kilbride was a good man."</p><p>I forced a smile. "Yeah, the minister did a pretty good job, considering he'd never met Dad. He wasn't much of a churchgoer. I guess we were lucky to find anyone to preside. Thanks for coming to the service. It almost got us up to a dozen."</p><p>Eleven people showed up for the funeral, and that was counting the minister and myself. There was Harry, and three of Dad's coworkers from the company he'd worked for, including his onetime boss, Len Prentice, and Len's wife, Marie. Also there were a friend of Dad's who ran a hardware store in Promise Falls before the Home Depot opened up outside of town and put him out of business, Dad's younger brother Ted and his wife, Roberta, from Cleveland, and a woman named Hannah whose last name I never got who lived just down the road from Dad. And there was a woman Thomas and I knew from high school, Julie McGill, who worked for the local paper, the <i>Promise Falls Standard</i>, and had written the story about Dad's accident. She hadn't come to report on the funeral&#x2014;how Dad died had made him a small news item, but he wasn't citizen of the year or head of the Rotary or anything. His service to the community was not newsworthy. Julie had come to pay her respects, simple as that.</p><p>The funeral home had a lot of egg salad sandwiches left over. They insisted I take some back to the house for my brother. I'd explained his absence by saying he wasn't feeling well, but no one, at least no one who knew my brother, believed it. I was tempted to pitch the sandwiches out the car window on the way home. Let the birds enjoy them, instead of my brother. But I didn't. I took them home, and they all got eaten.</p><p>"I'd hoped your brother might have come," Harry said. "It's been some time since I've seen him." At first I thought he meant to this meeting, which puzzled me, since my brother was not an executor. Then I realized Harry meant the funeral.</p><p>"Yeah, well, I gave it my best shot," I said. "He wasn't really sick."</p><p>"I figured."</p><p>"I tried to talk him into it, but it was pointless."</p><p>Peyton shook his head sympathetically. "Your father, he tried to do his best by him. Just like when your mother&#x2014;Rose, God bless her&#x2014;was still with us. How long's it been?"</p><p>"She passed away in 2005."</p><p>"After that, it must have been even more difficult for him."</p><p>"He was still with P&amp;L then," I said. Prentice and Long, the printers. "I think, maybe, after he took that early retirement not long after that, it got tougher. Being there, all the time. It got to him, but he wasn't the kind of man to run away from something." I bit my lip. "Mom, she found ways not to let it bother her, she had a way of accepting things, but it was tougher for Dad."</p><p>"Adam was a young man, really," Harry said. "Sixty-two, for Christ's sake. I was stunned when I heard."</p><p>"Yeah, well, me, too," I said. "I don't know how many times Mom told him, over the years, that cutting grass on that steep hill, on the lawn tractor, was dangerous. But he always insisted he knew what he was doing. Thing is, that part of the property, it's way back of the house you can't see it from the road or any of the neighbors' places. The ground slopes almost forty-five degrees down to the creek. Dad would mow along there sideways, leaning his body into the hill so the tractor wouldn't tip over."</p><p>"How long do they think your father was out there before they found him, Ray?"</p><p>"Dad probably went out to cut the grass after lunch, and wasn't discovered until nearly six. When the tractor flipped over on top of him, the ...</p></p><h2>Hello Reader: Make Your Way For Tooth Decay (Level 3)</h2><p>Meet your guests. / We're called bacteria. / Your mouth is our cafeteria.<br><br>In this witty, easy-to-read story, children learn what bacteria is, how it causes tooth decay, and how they can fight against it.

It turned out to be the right choice, as Alcindor and his teammates won an unprecedented three NCAA championship titles. But it also marked the beginning of one of the most extraordinary and enduring friendships in the history of sports. In COACH WOODEN AND ME, Abdul-Jabbar reveals the inspirational story of how his bond with John Wooden evolved from a history-making coach-player mentorship into a deep and genuine friendship that transcended sports, shaped the course of both men's lives, and lasted for half a century.<br>COACH WOODEN AND ME is a stirring tribute to the subtle but profound influence that Wooden had on Kareem as a player, and then as a person, as they began to share their cultural, religious, and family values while facing some of life's biggest obstacles. From his first day of practice, when the players were taught the importance of putting on their athletic socks properly; to gradually absorbing the sublime wisdom of Coach Wooden's now famous "Pyramid of Success"; to learning to cope with the ugly racism that confronted black athletes during the turbulent Civil Rights era as well as losing loved ones, Abdul-Jabbar fondly recalls how Coach Wooden's fatherly guidance not only paved the way for his unmatched professional success but also made possible a lifetime of personal fulfillment.<br>Full of intimate, never-before-published details and delivered with the warmth and erudition of a grateful student who has learned his lessons well, COACH WOODEN AND ME is at once a celebration of the unique philosophical outlook of college basketball's most storied coach and a moving testament to the all-conquering power of friendship.</p><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the NBA's all-time leading scorer and a six-time NBA champion. He is also one of a handful of influential and respected black men in America who has a national platform as a regular contributing columnist for the <i>Washington Post </i>and <i>TIME</i>, where he shares his thoughts on some of the most socially relevant and politically controversial topics facing our nation today. After 50 years as an athlete, activist, and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author, he offers his perspectives on how we can work together to solve some of these issues as a nationally recognized speaker who regularly appears on the lecture circuit. His book, <i>Writings on the Wall</i> was just released in Fall 2016 by Time Books and offers his personal perspectives on political issues facing America today. <br>In 2012, Kareem was appointed to be the U.S. Cultural Ambassador by then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Currently he serves as the chairman of his Skyhook Foundation whose mission is to "Give Kids a Shot That Can't be Blocked" by bringing educational opportunities to under-served communities through innovative outdoor environmental learning. Kareem's most recent projects include the HBO Sports documentary, <i>Kareem: Minority of One</i>, which debuted in early November 2015 as HBO's most watched and highest rated sports documentary. His debut novel <i>Mycroft Holmes</i>-a mystery novel and the first of an action/mystery series based on Sherlock Holmes's savvy older brother-was released by Titan Publishing in September 2015. Following the success of his novel, the comic, <i>Mycroft Holmes &amp; the Apocalypse Handbook</i> was developed into a series of 5 comic books."This latest masterpiece by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is even better than all the rest...

Ruth Schwartz Cowan and Matthew H. Hersch demonstrate how technological change has always been closely related to social and economic development, and examine the important mutual relationships between social history and technological change. They explain how the unique characteristics of American cultures and American geography have affected the technologies that have been invented, manufactured, and used throughout the years and also the reverse: how those technologies have affected the daily lives, the unique cultures, and the environments of all Americans.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ruth Schwartz Cowan</strong> is Janice and Julian Bers Professor Emerita of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania.<br> <br><strong>Matthew H.

Michael J. Seth explores the origins and development of Korean society, politics, and still little-known cultural heritage from their inception to the two Korean states of today. Telling the remarkable story of the origins and evolution of a society that borrowed and adopted from abroad, Seth describes how various tribal peoples in the peninsula came together to form one of the world&#x2019;s most distinctive communities. He shows how this ancient, culturally and ethnically homogeneous society was wrenched into the world of late-nineteenth-century imperialism, fell victim to Japanese expansionism, and then became arbitrarily divided into two opposed halves, North and South, after World War II. <br><br><br>Tracing the post-war years since 1945, the book explains how the two Koreas, with their deeply different political and social systems and geopolitical orientations, evolved into sharply contrasting societies. South Korea, after an unpromising start, became one of the few postcolonial developing states to enter the ranks of the first world, with a globally competitive economy, a democratic political system, and a cosmopolitan and dynamic culture. North Korea, by contrast, became one of the world&#x2019;s most totalitarian and isolated societies, a nuclear power with an impoverished and famine-stricken population. Seth describes and analyzes the radically different and historically unprecedented trajectories of the two Koreas, formerly one tight-knit society. Throughout, he adds a rare dimension by placing Korean history into broader global perspective. All readers looking for a balanced, knowledgeable history will be richly rewarded with this clear and concise book.</p><p>Michael J. Seth is professor of history at James Madison University.Michael Seth&#x2019;s text remains the most accessible overview of Korean history. Going beyond the platitudes about the &#x2018;land of the morning calm&#x2019; or the &#x2018;hermit kingdom,&#x2019; it is a useful and clear guide to the Korean peninsula&#x2019;s turbulent past. (John Lie, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>Whenever I'm asked to recommend a textbook on Korean history, I always put Michael Seth&#x2019;s A Concise History of Korea at the top of my list. Now in its third edition, the book provides the most up-to-date survey of Korean history, introducing fresh research and interpretations. Seth places Korea clearly within the East Asian world and highlights the unique aspects of Korea&#x2019;s past. As with the previous edition, Michael Seth succeeds in this history in every way. (Edward Shultz, emeritus, University of Hawaii at Manoa)<br><br>Michael Seth&#x2019;s A Concise History of Korea remains the best overview of Korean history in the English language. Both thorough and readable, it is the ideal book to use in undergraduate-level Korean history courses. It is also great for anybody who wants to know more about almost any aspect of Korean history.

The fruits of geology provide most of the materials that give us shelter, and most of the energy that drives our modern lives. Within the study of geology lie some of the clues to the extraordinary impact our species is going to play out on the planet, in centuries and millennia to come.<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Jan Zalasiewicz gives a brief introduction to the fascinating field of geology. Describing how the science developed from its early beginnings, he looks at some of the key discoveries that have transformed it, before delving into its various subfields, such as sedimentology, tectonics, and stratigraphy. Analyzing the geological foundations of the Earth, Zalasiewicz explains the interlocking studies of tectonics, geophysics, and igneous and metamorphic petrology and geochemistry; and describes how rocks are dated by radiometric dating. Considering the role and importance of geology in the finding and exploitation of resources (including fracking), he also discusses its place in environmental issues, such as foundations for urban structures and sites for landfill, and in tackling issues associated with climate change. Zalasiewicz concludes by discussing the exciting future and frontiers of the field, such as the exploration of the geology of Mars.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Shear walls resist wind and earthquake forces to protect buildings from collapse. This book explains the engineering principles involved with shear wall design and proper construction. It is written in non-technical language intended for carpenters and builders. The basic, unchanging physical principles are explained with illustrated examples. This guide goes into detail that no other book on the subject even approaches. Over 180 pages and 150 color photos and illustrations show actual construction conditions and examples of proper and improper installations. It is extensively indexed for quick reference to specific topics. A detailed two-page illustration shows many basic requirements in graphical format for easy guidance. Specific sections of the International Building Code and International Residential Code are referenced where appropriate. This edition includes a new chapter on earthquake strengthening methods for existing buildings. This chapter was itself expanded into a completely separate book (over 250 pages) titled &#34;Earthquake Strengthening for Vulnerable Homes.&#34; The book is intended mostly for carpenters and builders, but engineers and building inspectors also find the information very useful. Engineers may learn methods to make their shear wall designs more efficient and effective. An extensive inspection checklist (over 70 items) is included. This checklist is the basis for Special Inspection Guidelines for Wood-Frame Construction, currently under development by the Structural Engineers Association of Northern California.</p><p></p><h2>Poet of Revolution: The Making of John Milton</h2><p>Date not stated</p><p></p><h2>Cimarron Rose (A Holland Family Novel)</h2><p>Texas attorney Billy Bob Holland must confront the past in order to save his illegitimate son from a murder conviction in this brilliant, fast-paced thriller from beloved <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author James Lee Burke.<br><br>Lucas Smothers, nineteen and from the wrong end of town, has been arrested for the rape and murder of a local girl. His lawyer, former Texas Ranger Billy Bob Holland, is convinced of Lucas&#x2019;s innocence&#x2014;but proving it means unearthing the truth from the seething mass of deceit and corruption that spreads like wildfire in a gossipy small town where everybody knows everybody else&#x2019;s business.<br> <br>Billy Bob&#x2019;s relationship with Lucas&#x2019;s family is not an easy one. Years back he was a close friend of Mrs. Smothers&#x2014;too close, according to her husband. But when Lucas overhears gruesome tales of serial murder from a neighboring cell in the local lock-up, he himself looks like a candidate for an untimely death, and Billy Bob incurs enemies far more dangerous than any he faced as a Ranger.<br> <br>With the same electric language and hard-edged style that brought James Lee Burke&#x2019;s Dave Robicheaux novels to the forefront of American crime fiction, <i>Cimarron Rose</i> explodes with a harsh, evocative setting and unforgettable characters.</p><p>Billy Bob Holland, the protagonist of <i>Cimarron Rose</i>, is an attorney in the dusty Texas town of Deaf Smith. An ex-Texas Ranger (cop, not ball-player) who mistakenly killed his partner during a drug bust, Holland is jolted from his brooding when his estranged illegitimate son is accused of the rape and murder of a party girl. He takes the case, of course, and things get complicated mighty quick. On a hunch only a father could believe, Holland is sure his son is being railroaded. Doggedly pursuing the truth, he runs afoul of sadistic cops, a powerful family, and the euphoniously-named Garland T. Moon, a feral thug with something to hide. Luckily, the folks on his team are just as tough. Burke's book isn't gritty realism--Holland's dead partner visits him often--but the characters ring true in a weird way. They are quirky and appealing, and even the criminals make good company while the whodunit unfolds.<p>Texas attorney and former Texas Ranger Billy Bob Holland has many secrets. Among them is Vernon Smother's son, Lucas, a now-teenaged boy about whom few know the truth -- Lucas is really Billy Bob's illegitimate son. When Lucas is arrested for murder, Billy Bob must confront the past and serve as the boy's criminal attorney. </p><p>Billy Bob knows the propensity of the town, Deaf Smith, Texas, to make scapegoats out of the innocent and to exploit and sexually use the powerless. During Lucas's trial, Billy Bob realizes that he will have to bring injury upon Lucas as well as himself in order to save his son. As a result, Billy Bob incurs enemies that are far more dangerous than any he faced as a Texas Ranger. </p><p>With the same electric language and hard-edged style that brought James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux novels to the forefront of American crime fiction, <i>Cimarron Rose</i> explodes with a new, evocative setting that will establish Billy Bob Holland as James Lee Burke's next great character.</p></p><h2>Alcoholics Anonymous - Big Book Special Edition - Including: Personal Stories</h2><p>It's more than a book.

We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living has its advantages for all. It is important that we remain anonymous because we are too few, at present to handle the overwhelming number of personal appeals which may result from this publication. Being mostly business or professional folk, we could not well carry on our occupations in such an event. We would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an avocation. When writing or speaking publicly about alcoholism, we urge each of our Fellowship to omit his personal name, designating himself instead as "a member of Alcoholics Anonymous." Very earnestly we ask the press also, to observe this request, for otherwise we shall be greatly handicapped. We are not an organization in the conventional sense of the word. There are no fees or dues whatsoever. The only requirement for membership is an honest desire to stop drinking. We are not allied with any particular faith, sect or denomination, nor do we oppose anyone. We simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted. We shall be interested to hear from those who are getting results from this book, particularly form those who have commenced work with other alcoholics. We should like to be helpful to such cases.

Now Wells must find out who is killing them. Islamic terrorists are the likeliest suspects, and Wells is uniquely qualified to go undercover and find them. But the trail of blood leads him to a place he couldn&#x2019;t have imagined: Home.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Alex Berenson Talks About His New Novel, <em>The Midnight House</em></strong> <br> <br> <b> As a reporter for <i>The New York Times, </i> Alex Berenson has covered topics ranging from the occupation of Iraq to the flooding of New Orleans to the financial crimes of Bernie Madoff. His previous novels include <em>The Faithful Spy</em>, winner of the 2007 Edgar Award for best first novel, <em>The Ghost War</em>, and <em>The Silent Man</em>. </b> <br> <br> John Wells has been through a lot. <br> <br> Over the course of his first three missions&#x2014;chronicled in <em>The Faithful Spy</em>, <em>The Ghost War</em>, and <em>The Silent Man</em> &#x2014;he&#x2019;s been shot. Twice. He&#x2019;s been beaten nearly to death in a prison in Beijing. He&#x2019;s fought hand-to-hand against Russian special forces soldiers in a cave in Afghanistan. He&#x2019;s repelled an assassination attempt in a traffic jam in Washington. <br> <br> And, of course, there was that time he was infected with the plague. <br> <br> Just writing this list makes me wince a little bit, too. You see, John is real to me&#x2014;and, based on the e-mail I receive, to lots of readers, too. Unlike a typical action hero, he&#x2019;s not a human Etch-a-Sketch. He can&#x2019;t shake himself clean, forget everything he&#x2019;s seen and done, and wake up ready for his next mission. He has nightmares and fits of depression. Yet he will never give up his roles as protector and&#x2014;unique to Wells&#x2014;infiltrator, each of which brings with it specific and intense psychological stresses, and so he has no choice but to soldier on. <br> <br> Put simply, Wells, like many veterans, has posttraumatic stress disorder. The syndrome has gone by different names over the years: &#x201c;shell shock,&#x201d; &#x201c;the thousand-yard stare,&#x201d; &#x201c;combat fatigue.&#x201d; Most soldiers don&#x2019;t like talking about it, especially to civilians. And with the help of their families and fellow soldiers, the great majority eventually find a way to put their experiences behind them. But some suffer terribly. The number of suicides in the Army has more than doubled since the Iraq war began, rising from 67 in 2003 to at least 150 in 2009. <br> <br> So in writing my fourth novel, <i>The Midnight House,</i> I wanted to respect the real-world impact that war has on the men and women who fight it. I hear from soldiers and veterans who read these novels, and who see themselves in Wells. I would hate to betray them by turning him into a comic-book character. And I am very conscious of the trauma Wells has accumulated, both physical and psychic. It&#x2019;s just not realistic to bring him to the edge of death over and over and expect him to survive. I also wanted to give him a break from killing, to the extent I could. Not that he&#x2019;s become a pacifist; far from it. But, without giving too much away, he is a detective as much as a soldier in this book, and he tries to avoid using force whenever he can. (In <em>The Silent Man</em> in contrast, he deliberately seeks out revenge even when Jennifer Exley, his then fianc�e, asks him not to.) <br> <br> Don&#x2019;t worry, though. From start to finish, The Midnight House has plenty of excitement, and the early reviews have been great. <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> called the novel &#x201c;a superbly crafted spy thriller that doubles as a gripping mystery,&#x201d; and <i>Publishers Weekly</i> said it is &#x201c;exceptional&#x201d; and &#x201c;compelling.&#x201d; I hope you&#x2019;ll agree. And I hope that when you&#x2019;re done reading, you&#x2019;ll remember that although John Wells is only as real as the pages (or screens) of these novels, the valor and sacrifice that he represents is alive every day in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in the homes of soldiers and veterans across America. <br> <br> <em>--Alex Berenson</em> <br> <br> (Photo of Alex Berenson � Sigrid Estrada)<b>Alex Berenson</b>&nbsp;is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the John Wells series, including&nbsp;<i>The Faithful Spy</i>, which&nbsp;won the 2007 Edgar Award for best first novel.&nbsp;As a reporter for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;Berenson&nbsp;covered topics ranging from the occupation of Iraq&#x2014;where he was stationed for three months&#x2014;to the flooding of New Orleans, to the world pharmaceutical industry, to the financial crimes of Bernie Madoff.

Being a grandmother is a constant learning and teaching experience, because as grandmothers, women must learn to apply yesterday&#x2019;s wisdom to today&#x2019;s challenges. &#x2014;Kristen Johnson Ingram, I&#x2019;ll Ask My Grandmother&#x2014;She&#x2019;s Very Wise Mom, you&#x2019;re going to be a grandmother!" When you first hear these words, the prospect of seeing a new generation raised up ignites hope, love, and purpose in your life. A grand opportunity awaits you to immediately begin praying for the spiritual, physical, and emotional well-being of your grandchild. Perhaps you&#x2019;re wondering whether your prayers can actually make a difference in your grandchild&#x2019;s life. I (Quin) had an encounter one day that reminded me how much of a difference a grandmother&#x2019;s prayers can make. "She Was Always Praying for Me" "I&#x2019;ll bet you had a praying grandmother," I said to the professional basketball player I&#x2019;d been chatting with while we were waiting in the Atlanta airport for our flight to be called. "I did, but how did you know?" he asked, looking surprised. "While we&#x2019;ve been talking, you mentioned her several times and spoke about how much you love and admire her," I answered. "Yes," he said softly, dropping his head. "When my mom left, my grandmother took me in to live with her. Through all those years, she prayed for me and encouraged me in every sport I ever tried. She always told me I could become a professional athlete if I set a goal, practiced for hours, and depended on God to strengthen me." "And it looks like some of those prayers have been answered," I replied. "She was always praying for me," he continued with a smile. "I could call her from anywhere I was playing a game, and she&#x2019;d pray on the phone for me right then. She was a wonderful grand-mother&#x2014; old now but still praying." What a tribute to a quiet little grandmother who poured her life and prayers into an abandoned grandson, never dreaming he would one day become a well-known athlete. And what an encouragement to praying grandmothers that their efforts are not in vain! When the apostle Paul wrote to his spiritual son, Timothy (in the verse quoted at the beginning of this chapter), he acknowledged&#x2014; for all generations to follow&#x2014;the powerful influence of a godly grandmother. In this book, we hope to expand your vision to see just how far-reaching your spiritual influence upon your grand-children can be. Keeping a heart connection with them is the important thing, whether they live close to you or many miles distant. We&#x2019;ll share creative ideas through stories of other grandmothers to show you how. Also, we&#x2019;ll provide guidelines to help you establish a scriptural strategy for praying for your grandchildren. Impacting the Next Generation Most grandmothers probably have given their best years to rearing their children. They&#x2019;ve sacrificed, worried, scolded, and encouraged&#x2014;and through it all prayed that God would keep their children safe and help them become mature adults. As author Barbara Johnson says, "We&#x2019;re always hoping that something we instilled in them might show up, even when we&#x2019;ve started to think it&#x2019;s too late." Some, feeling their work is now over, may sigh with relief when their children leave home and later start families of their own. Others may be tempted to spend their best energy pursuing a relaxing lifestyle filled with travel and hobbies. A few may feel a bit depressed, wondering why they seem to have no purpose now that their children are out of the nest. Whatever our situation, God still has more kingdom work for us moms to do, especially when it comes to our grandchildren. Even if you don&#x2019;t yet have any, it&#x2019;s never too early to begin praying for your grandchildren. Whether a child is in the womb or is only a dream, you can influence your future grandchildren for good through your prayers. They are our link to the future, and our faithfulness to pray for them can greatly impact this new generation. With the pressure on families today, grandchildren need our hugs, reassurance, and wisdom more than ever. And most of all, they need our prayers and godly influence. Grandmothers usually are fond of giving gifts to their grandchildren, but the greatest and most lasting gift they can give is one of faithful prayer. Many children have no one except a grandma to pray for them. "What Grandma Meant to Me" When we asked people to share what a grandmother&#x2019;s spiritual influence has meant in their lives, we got a variety of answers. � "My grandmother gave me a sense of security and stability and taught me many practical things. Because my mom was a teenager when I was born, she was too young and immature to add that dimension to my life." � "Granny was my hero; she always remembered my birthday and other special moments in my life. But most of all, she prayed for me." � "My grandmother read my favorite stories to me over and over; then I&#x2019;d let her read me her favorite ones from her well-worn Bible." � "Grandma Jessie had twelve children and helped manage a farm for much of her life, yet she always seemed calm and serene. I never saw her get upset or raise her voice. She left me with an enduring sense that whatever comes, faith in God remains imperturbable. Nothing ever wins against it." � "My great-grandmother&#x2019;s prayers have followed me from the day I was born. Like a heavenly searchlight, her prayers have exposed darkness in my life."</p><h2>Mouse House Hunter (Geronimo Stilton #61) (61)</h2><p>When you're with me, Geronimo Stilton, it's always a fabu-mouse adventure!<br><br>Sally Ratmousen broke some shocking news: <i>The Rodent's Gazette</i> was out of money and in danger of closing.

If you do not bring forth <br>what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.<br>&#x2015;The Gnostic Gospel of St. Thomas</p> <p>ij </p> <p>As warped as Scrooge's behavior may seem, his actions make perfect sense when viewed in the context of his beliefs about money. Several hidden beliefs are at the root of Scrooge's misery. For example, Scrooge believed 'You can't trust anyone with your money.' He didn't even trust his loyal clerk, Bob Cratchit. We can see this clearly in the first chapter of A Christmas Carol:</p> <p>'The door of Scrooge's counting house was open<br>that he might keep his eye upon his clerk.'</p> <p>Scrooge also believed that you 'Don't spend money on yourself or others.' He lived this belief to the extreme. He barely heated his office and lit his sparse apartment with a single candle:</p> <p>'Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it.'</p> <p>These and other similar behaviors certainly appear severe, but not when you look at his perspective of the world. In view of these underlying and mostly unconscious beliefs, Scrooge's actions are perfectly logical, at least from his perspective. In our work, we have come to believe that every financial behavior, no matter how seemingly illogical, makes perfect sense when we understand the underlying beliefs. Scrooge's excessive behaviors merely reflected what he believed to be true.<br><br>We call these powerful beliefs money scripts.</p> <p><br><strong>Money Scripts</strong></p> <p>Very early in life, people begin to internalize messages about money's purpose&#x2015;how it works, what it promises, its overall significance&#x2015;and develop their relationship to it. Since children can't fully grasp adult reality, they translate what they see and hear into unconscious rules about life, including any internalized messages about money. These messages about money, or money scripts, don't necessarily reflect reality from the adult perspective. Instead, they may represent only a distorted or partial truth as seen through the eyes of a child. As children grow into adulthood, they often behave as though these partial truths are absolute truths. They may find themselves unable to change destructive behaviors that, at a very basic level, somehow feel right and make perfect sense.<br><br>Think of a money script like the script for a play with several roles in it. The script is written by one person, and a specific role in the script is memorized by another person&#x2015;an actor who plays one character in that particular play. If the actor memorizes the script and executes his lines well, the result will be exactly what the playwright intended. However, if the actor attempts to use the same script for any other role, or in any other play, the results will be disastrous. It is the same with money scripts.<br><br>To learn their lines, actors must repeat them over and over. Few actors, no matter how talented, can read a script once and then deliver a flawless performance. They must practice frequently. In a similar way, the depth of any money script depends on the frequency and intensity of the original event or financial trauma. A child who hears his mother voice concern once about how the family business may fail and that they may not have money for food will probably not internalize a damaging money script. However, if the child hears his mother voice that fear monthly, weekly or daily, the result could be a deeply held belief that will influence the child's behavior well into adulthood. Our deepest, most ingrained money scripts are often formed by such examples of financial trauma.<br><br>For example, when Brenda was eight years old, she, unlike the rest of her siblings, saved her money. When the rest of the family needed money, they robbed her piggy bank.<br><br>Sounds sad but innocent enough, right? But little Brenda internalized the same message that Scrooge internalized: 'You can't trust anyone with your money.' This worked for both Scrooge and Brenda as children. However, as adults, the results of this money script didn't work for either of them&#x2015;although the results for Brenda were very different from Scrooge's.<br><br>As an adult, Brenda earns $250,000 a year. She needs only $100,000 to support her preferred lifestyle, but she spends the entire amount each year. She doesn't use many of the things she buys. She spends all of her money rather than saves or invests it because of an unconscious fear that others will take it away. This old belief is reinforced when her parents and siblings frequently call and want her to bail them out of some financial dilemma. By never having any money in the bank, she can say no when her siblings ask her for money. Unfortunately, spending money as quickly as she gets it makes her just like them&#x2015;always broke.</p> <p>Money scripts internalized in childhood<br>can affect our beliefs and behaviors<br>well into adulthood.</p> <p><strong><br>Why Money Scripts Are So Powerful</strong><br><br>Brenda's belief, originating from a child's perspective of an experience, created a money script that is still affecting her today. Brenda's subconscious belief is keeping her from achieving success. She neglects to save for her future. So, while she is enjoying the fruits of her labors, her inability to say no to her family and her failure to save jeopardize her financial future. Worse, because it is mostly unconscious, Brenda isn't even aware that this money script is sabotaging her career goals and dreams for her own family. Instead, she feels a vague sense of dissatisfaction and failure because she knows she should be saving and investing for her future, but can't.<br><br>When we met Brenda, she thought the answer to saving money was to earn more; then she could save. The problem was that she had been saying the same thing to herself as she moved up the salary scale from $50,000 to $100,000 to $150,000 to $250,000. To us, it was obvious that the solution lay elsewhere, in her basic money script.</p> <p>People are generally unaware of their<br>money scripts and how their self-defeating behaviors are linked to them.</p> <p>Often, these messages learned during childhood are buried so deeply that the individual doesn't know about or question the belief, even when acting on it causes him or her repeated problems.<br><br>It is important to understand that money scripts are not inherently good or bad, right or wrong. Certain money scripts can serve us well when applied to the appropriate financial circumstance. However, money scripts can become a problem, even become destructive, when they are applied to inappropriate financial circumstances.<br><br>For example, have you ever met anyone with this money script:</p> <p>'I deserve to spend money on myself.'</p> <p>Now, believing you deserve to spend money on yourself is not inherently bad. In fact, it can be very positive. We hope you believe this to be true. Many people do not share this belief, but we all deserve to take care of ourselves. Never�theless, believing you deserve something extravagant for your�self today at the expense of saving for tomorrow can undermine your financial well-being.<br><br>Moreover, believing that you deserve to spend money on yourself to the point that you feel entitled to do so regardless of your circumstances can also be destructive. Professional credit counselors tell us that this is a typical money script among people with excessive debt. Some of their stories of money mismanagement are incredible.<br><br>Carl had serious credit problems. Quite unexpectedly, he received a windfall inheritance. He could have used it to pay off his debt. He could have saved it. He could have used it to rebuild his life. Instead, he bought a new car. He threw a big party, bought new clothes and gave money away. Within months, he was back in the same predicament. This is not an isolated example. Dave Ramsey, a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host, author and founder of Financial Peace University, has cited statistics showing that within seven years of coming into money, the average person, like Carl, will be living at the same economic level as they were before the windfall appeared.<br><br>This behavior seems incredibly destructive, yet it makes sense to the person whose money script is 'I deserve to spend money on myself.' Having that money script creates the same consequences that would have occurred if the person had made a conscious decision to be poor.</p> <p><br><strong>Money Scripts Are Generational</strong></p> <p>Frequently, our money scripts are passed down through the generations. When people carefully explore their family histories, clear and profound patterns of financial behaviors often emerge. With close examination of our multigenerational family stories, we are able to identify the money scripts driving the actions of our ancestors. Many of us live our financial lives unaware of how powerfully our beliefs around money are linked to the specific experiences of our ancestors. As such, they continue to affect us today, long after their adaptive and functional aspects have lost their benefit.<br><br>In our work with clients, we still see in today's forty- to sixty-year-olds the lessons their parents and grandparents learned during the Great Depression. Hiding money, hoarding money, not trusting banks or investment institutions, and poverty thinking are behaviors that still plague the children and grandchildren of family members traumatized by those economic and social experiences. <br><br>Younger clients suffer from other thinking distortions. One father told us of his uneasiness as he handed his eight-year-old daughter her twenty-dollar-a-week allowance. He sensed that the amount was too much, but he didn't want her to feel different from the other kids in the neighborhood whose parents gave their eight-year-olds that amount.<br><br>Another parent told of his distress in realizing that his seven-year-old had no idea where money comes from or what is involved in acquiring it. He learned this when he told her she could not have something she wanted because there was no money for it. Her response was, 'Daddy, just go to the wall and get some.' She had learned that money comes from 'the wall,' better known to adults as an ATM. In fact, we have worked with a number of clients who tell us that one of their beliefs is that 'Money is not real.' Since it is not real, then there is nothing to deal with.<br><br>Money scripts and their consequences, such as the ones we have mentioned, are much more of a potential problem than ever. Two generations ago, if you got a good job, worked hard and were a loyal employee, at the end of twenty-five, thirty or forty years of service, you received an adequate guaranteed retirement. That, along with Social Security, would pretty much guarantee you would have sufficient funds for the rest of your life. Now, however, both corporate America and the Social Security system have changed radically. Fewer companies offer defined benefits retirement plans. Fewer employees choose or even have the option of lifetime employment. And the Social Security system is bending and threatening to collapse under the weight of too many recipients, too few contributors and the extended life spans of the beneficiaries. Given this reality, old money scripts and their resulting behaviors can be disastrous.</p> <p><br><strong>Knowledge Is Power</strong></p> <p>The following sections examine the money scripts driving Scrooge, Cratchit and many people today. Armed with this knowledge, you'll be ready to begin recognizing at least some of your own money scripts. In some cases, awareness, along with a commitment to change, is enough to change behavior that is being driven by an unconscious belief and can help clear the way for conscious beliefs to move into the driver's seat.<br><br></p> <p><strong>Scrooge Chose to Be Poor</strong></p> <p>As we've mentioned, despite his great wealth, Ebenezer Scrooge unconsciously chose to be poor. Of course, if the definition of poor were measured solely by one's bank account, Scrooge would certainly not fit that definition. On the other hand, if you define poor as a measure of the quality of one's physical environment, emotional health, relationship quality and lifestyle, then Scrooge would certainly qualify as poor. Scrooge's excessive hoarding created an impoverishment as real as any caused by financial distress. Ironically, Scrooge's money scripts created the very poverty and isolation that Young Scrooge had so desperately tried to avoid.</p> <p>� As an apprentice under Fezziwig, Young Scrooge had to sleep under a counter at the warehouse. As an adult, Scrooge lives in a dreary old apartment that was as cold and sparse as a warehouse.<br>� As a child, Scrooge spent the holidays alone at the warehouse. As an adult, Scrooge spends the holidays alone in his rooms.<br>� As a child, Scrooge was poor. As an adult, Scrooge lives a meager existence, eating sparingly and barely heating or lighting his tiny dwelling.</p> <p>Scrooge lived in a poverty created by his own beliefs and behaviors around money.</p> <p><br><strong>Scrooge's Money Scripts</strong></p> <p>As we observe Scrooge's behaviors, we can begin to see the money scripts that drove them. These are just a few of Scrooge's money scripts:</p> <p>� You can't trust anyone with your money.<br>� People only want you for your money.<br>� You must work hard for money.<br>� You can never have enough money.<br>� Don't spend money on yourself or others.<br>� Money will give you meaning in life.<br>� The more money you have, the happier you will be.<br>� You can never be happy if you are poor.<br>� Giving to the poor encourages laziness.<br>� If you had more money, things would be better.</p> <p>Scrooge was living in harmony with what he believed to be true. Unfortunately, many of his beliefs about money were distorted half-truths. As a result, he was living a life full of pain and loneliness and devoid of love.</p> <p>Your money scripts could be<br>keeping you financially, emotionally<br>or spiritually poor.</p> <p>Similarly, your money scripts could be the reason you are in debt, facing bankruptcy and living in deprivation. Your money scripts could be sabotaging your quest for the American dream, your retirement, your children's education and your financial security. Even if you have significant wealth, your money scripts could be destroying your peace of mind, relationships, happiness and sense of fulfillment.</p> <p><strong><br>Cratchit Chose to Be Poor</strong></p> <p>One could argue that Bob Cratchit, Scrooge's loyal clerk and father of Tiny Tim, was a victim of circumstance. He was trapped in an abusive socioeconomic system that didn't allow the less fortunate individual to advance. On the other hand, we would argue that Cratchit's unconscious money scripts contributed to his poverty. He didn't truly appreciate his own talents and skills. He undersold himself. He spent impulsively when he could have bought medicine for his son. He didn't know what steps to take to plan for his own future. In effect, it's possible that Cratchit made an unconscious decision to be poor.<br></p> <p><br><strong>Cratchit's Money Scripts</strong></p> <p>Bob Cratchit is often characterized as the eternal optimist, always finding the silver lining in a bad situation.

It had a century-old legend&#x2014;two fugitive slaves had been killed by bounty hunters after leaving its passageways, and Dies Drear himself, the abolitionist who had made the house into a station on the Underground Railroad, had been murdered there. The ghosts of the three were said to walk its rooms...</p><p>A huge, old house with secret tunnels, a cantankerous caretaker, and buried treasure is a dream-come-true for 13-year-old Thomas. The fact that it's reputedly haunted only adds to its appeal! As soon as his family moves in, Thomas senses something strange about the Civil War era house, which used to be a critical stop on the Underground Railroad. With the help of his father, he learns about the abolitionists and escaping slaves who kept the Underground Railroad running. While on his own, he explores the hidden passageways in and under the house, piecing clues together in an increasingly dangerous quest for the truth about the past.

They begin a daring relationship that calls into question the very nature of family, belief, and tradition. Torn between the secular West and Muslim East, Wilson records her intensely personal struggle to forge a third culture&#x201d; that might accommodate her values without compromising them or the friends and family on both sides of the divide.</p><p>G.

Mike McKinley and Mez McConnell argue that while it is heartless to ignore the needs of the weak and suffering, the greatest need they have is the same need we all have&#x2015;to turn away from sin, embrace Christ, and grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ in a healthy fellowship of believers committed to one another under the faithful leadership of caring pastors who will equip the church for ongoing ministry. Apart from that, we are merely meeting temporal needs and offering no hope for a changed life now.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Juan R.

Probably more brides and homemakers in America have received gifts of and purchased glassware made at the Fostoria factory, in Moundsville, West Virginia, than any other glass company. During its century of operation, the range of style, form, decoration, color, and manufacturing technique was tremendous; only the fine quality remained constant. From 1915 until the factory closed in 1986, one pattern--American No. 2056--has remained a favorite, if not the most popular pattern sought after by glass collectors. This revised and expanded 3rd edition presents the hundreds of individual items in this amazing line, in more than 400 color photographs supplemented by black and white illustrations, with detailed captions, a revised up-to-date value guide, quick reference section, and an index. It is sure to fascinate and inform both the advanced and beginning collector, and no dealer should be without it.</p><p>Leslie Pina, Ph.D., is a professor at Ursuline College in Pepper Pike, Ohio, and has written and co-authored numerous books on glass, including Fostoria: Serving the American Table 1887-1986, Depression Era Art Deco Glass, and Depression Era Stems &amp; Tableware by Tiffin.</p><h2>The Way of the Five Elements: 52 Weeks of Powerful Acupoints for Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Health</h2><p><p>With its practical and immensely readable introduction to the nature and self-help uses of a key acupoint for each week of the year, this book is a gateway to the mysterious world of Chinese medical thought.</p><p>The author journeys through the seasons of the year, and the five elements that make up the Chinese universe, looking at the physical, emotional and spiritual associations of the most useful acupoints associated with each element.

After spending several years reporting on Silicon Valley and technology for the <em>New York Times</em>, Vance went to <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, where he has written dozens of cover and feature stories for the magazine on topics ranging from cyber espionage to DNA sequencing and space exploration.</p>Gr 8 Up&#x2014;This biography of Musk, one of the most important figures in modern technological advancement, aims to communicate the excitement and promise of the work that he and his companies&#x2014;Space X, Tesla, and Solar City&#x2014;are doing in the fields of aerospace, automotive transportation, and alternative energy. The book is organized around Musk's self-proclaimed quest to "guard man's fate in the universe" by "turning humans into space colonizers" and the varied paths that he has taken to achieve this end. The bulk of the narrative is focused on Musk's work with Space X and Tesla since the 2000s, with few details on his early life in South Africa. Vance creates a "you are there" feeling as he describes the early test launches of Space X rockets and the development of the revolutionary electric cars produced by Tesla. Musk and his friends and associates cooperated with the creation of the New York Times best-selling adult \ version of this biography, and that deep access to information shines through in this edition for young readers as well. The volume's more than 250 pages are crammed with details of the inner workings of Musk's companies, and the discussions on buyouts, venture capitalism, and initial public offerings may overwhelm those drawn to the title out of a more personal interest in Musk. Still, Vance maintains a lively pace and explains the groundbreaking technology in a way that is accessible and exciting. VERDICT Highly recommended for high school and ambitious middle school readers for its insights into Musk, technology, and venture capitalism.&#x2014;Kelly Kingrey-Edwards, Blinn Junior College, Brenham, TX</p><h2>The Flash 5: History Lessons</h2><p>The fifth volume of the New 52 breakout hit - The Flash!

This compelling, enduring, and highly original book argues that gender, as constructed in Western feminist discourse, did not exist in Africa before the colonial imposition of a dichotomous understanding of sexual difference. Amadiume examines the African societal structures that enabled people to achieve power within fluid masculine and feminine roles.<br><br> At a time when gender and queer theory is viewed by many as overly focused on identity politics, this apt text not only warns against the danger of projecting Western notions of difference onto other cultures, but also questions the very concept of gender itself.

In this inspiring young adult memoir, he tells how he achieved such great heights.<br><br>On May 22, 2010, at the age of thirteen, American teenager Jordan Romero became the youngest person to climb to the summit of Mount Everest. At fifteen, he became the youngest person to reach the summits of the tallest mountains on each of the seven continents. In this energizing memoir for young adults, Jordan, now seventeen, recounts his experience, which started as a spark of an idea at the age of nine and, many years of training and hard work later, turned into a dream come true.</p><p>Jordan Romero, born July 12, 1996, is an American mountain climber who on May 22, 2010, at the age of thirteen, became the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. By December 25, 2011, at the age of fifteen, he became the youngest person to climb to the summit of the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. He is now touring the United States, climbing the tallest peak in each of the fifty states. He lives in Big Bear Lake, California.No Summit out of Sight CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>It was the first day of fourth grade when I told my dad I had decided to climb the highest peak on each of the seven continents: the Seven Summits.<br> <br>I was nine, and all summer long I&#x2019;d been thinking about a mural on the wall of my elementary school, which laid out each of the Seven Summits and their elevations. I&#x2019;d passed it every day on my way to and from recess, all through third grade. Other kids hardly seemed to notice it in their rush to play soccer or basketball, but I often stopped and stared, mesmerized by those mountains. What would it be like to stand on their summits and gaze across entire continents? I wanted to find out.<br> <br>One thing you should know about me: When I get interested in something, I become a fanatic and learn everything I can about it. When I was younger and got interested in reptiles, I learned everything there was to know about every species. Now my interest turned to mountains.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always jumped into new interests with both feet, especially if they have to do with the outdoors. I&#x2019;ve never been into playing video games or watching TV. Practically from the moment I could walk, I was outdoors&#x2014;chasing lizards, riding my bike, skateboarding, and skiing. Especially skiing. That was my passion.<br> <br>But I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about those mountains. Over the summer between third and fourth grades, I did Internet searches to read about the summits. I made lists of their locations, their elevations, and the best routes to the top of each. Along the way I discovered that there were people who had made it a goal to climb all seven.<br> <br>I decided I could do that.<br> <br>I was the ultimate goal setter, so at that age I already understood that things didn&#x2019;t always happen instantly.<br> <br>But that was okay. I was also extremely patient.<br> <br>And frankly, I didn&#x2019;t think the idea would shock my dad that much. My dad and my stepmom, Karen, are professional athletes. They compete in extreme adventure races all over the world. It&#x2019;s a crazy sport. They race nonstop on foot, on bicycles, in kayaks and canoes, and even on horses and camels. And they do it all in some of the most wild and remote places in the world. Our home has always been open to a never-ending stream of competitive athletes who are driven to enter the most brutal contests on the planet.<br> <br>Dad and Karen thought outside the box, set huge goals, and grabbed life with both hands. So why couldn&#x2019;t I?<br> <br>Seeing that mural again on the first day of fourth grade help sharpen my resolve. My dad picked me up from school that day, and I sprang it on him.<br> <br>He was going on and on about this killer endurance event he and Karen were training for. They&#x2019;d been preparing nonstop for weeks. They were always going, going, going. They believed you should live your life, not watch it. Their motto hung on the front of the house: GO FAST. TAKE CHANCES.<br> <br>And I intended to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Dad, you ever heard of the Seven Summits?&#x201d;<br> <br>He glanced at me. &#x201c;Sort of, Little J,&#x201d; he said, using his nickname for me.<br> <br>I paused, took a deep breath, and exhaled slowly. &#x201c;I want to climb them.&#x201d;<br> <br>His jaw dropped, and he stared at me openmouthed for a minute.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oookaaay,&#x201d; he said. My dad has this way of stretching an &#x201c;okay&#x201d; out for a mile. This one went for two miles.<br> <br>I could tell he thought this was a someday kind of goal. But I wanted to do it sooner. &#x201c;Not when I&#x2019;m older, but, like, right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>That really surprised him.<br> <br>&#x201c;What made you decide that?&#x201d;<br> <br>I told him about the mural, and about how I had been looking at it for years and thinking about what it would be like to stand on top of each of those mountains and look at the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really know about all this?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>That was it, bang. I told him about all the stuff I&#x2019;d learned&#x2014;where and how high each summit was, what countries they were in, the best routes to the top of each summit.<br> <br>My dad has a huge smile, one that can light up a whole room. And nothing makes him happier than the idea of an athletic challenge. I watched his face closely, waiting for that smile. I guess I half expected him to say, Okay. Let&#x2019;s buy tickets for every corner of the world and leave tomorrow.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mountaineering is long, hard, and dirty,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not all fun. You&#x2019;d need weeks and even months of training before you could even think of climbing even the smallest ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care. I can do it,&#x201d; I answered.<br> <br>Dad thought about it for a minute. He didn&#x2019;t say yes, but he didn&#x2019;t exactly say no, either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get Super K,&#x201d; he said, using his nickname for Karen, &#x201c;and go for a hike.&#x201d;</p><h2>Case Closed, Vol. 6</h2><p>It&#39;s Conan versus the Phantom Thief!

Driven to it by colleagues, friends and students, writing this little book is an act of stubborn devotion to a fading culture. This deceptively simple system of folk magic has come down to modern Southern culture through the immigrants and natives who called these blue hills home. Written in an easily accessible style and filled with insights and stories, Staubs and Ditchwater: a Friendly and Useful Introduction to Hillfolks Hoodoo is part memoir, part workbook.</p><p>H. Byron Ballard is Asheville s Village Witch and does workshops and lectures regionally. She was a featured speaker at the Sacred Space Conference in 2011 and is a popular teacher at the Southeast Women s Herb Conference and Pagan Unity Festival. This book includes Hillfolks Hoodoo and the Question of Cultural Strip-mining the paper she delivered at Harvard s 2006 conference Forging Folklore. Ballard serves as a ritualist and teacher for Mother Grove Goddess Temple in Asheville, NCIt's been a very long time since a new book on any aspect of contemporary paganism came along that has not only seemed worthwhile but impressive. Byron Ballard's fascinating, engaging new book on Appalachian hoodoo beliefs and practices is not only a sparkling treasure chest of folklore and magical tidbits. It is full of pragmatic and wise advice on how to think, live and thrive in a changing world. Not for the faint of heart, this book will teach you how to hex, and also how to heal. It'll explain to you things you know (growing your own food is a good idea and fun) and things you don't (did you know you can expose a liar in public with very little effort?) and things you never thought you'd think about (I'll let you find out for yourself). Ballard is a charming writer, and this book brings her sly wit, native intelligence and sense of community compassion to any reader lucky enough to procure a copy. I can't imagine not having this book in my library, or not wanting to gift it to many friends. --Peg Aloi, Media Coordinator, The Witches' Voice; creator of The Witching Hour blog; media scholar; film critic; author<br><br>Like an Appalachian Brigit, Ballard tends an eternal fire. It s a flame that warms the hearth, but it s also a blaze that fuels a devotion to social justice. Her authority doesn t come from her degrees and her training (though she has them indeed), but from deep within her bones and within the earth of her home hills.

She helps single women ditch the dating apps and attract great men in the real world.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>On her journey to overcome social anxiety, Camille mastered the art of meaningful connection, which led to being asked on dates by hundreds of men - with zero use of technology. She is passionate about helping people create a more fulfilling life across every aspect: friendship, career, family, and romantic. </i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Camille has taught more than 100 live workshops, worked with clients across six continents, been featured in more than 50 international media outlets, and has followers from over 100 different countries.&nbsp;</i><b>Go for Depth, Not Breadth</b> <br> The fastest way to turn a conversation into an interview is by constantly switching topics, which prevents going deeper into any one of them. <br> For example, I had a dinner date with a man who played a not-so-fun game of 20 Questions. It was almost as if he had a set of &#x201c;Completely Unrelated Questions to Ask on a Date&#x201d; and was simply going down the list. He would ask one and I would answer, but when I tried to ask it back to him, he was already onto the next random question which had nothing to do with the previous one. We ran out of things to talk about in about ten minutes and our food hadn&#x2019;t even arrived yet. On the flip side, if we had gone deeper on any one of those questions, we could have talked about it for hours. <br> So instead of jumping around, find a topic you&#x2019;re genuinely interested in and ask insightful questions about it until it naturally segues to another interesting topic. To go deeper on a specific topic, ask questions related to how someone thinks or feels, or the &#x201c;why&#x201d; behind what they did. <br> Examples of feeling, thinking, and &#x201c;why&#x201d; questions: <br> � &#x201c;How do you feel about that?&#x201d; � &#x201c;Why did you do that?&#x201d; � &#x201c;What made you say that?&#x201d; � &#x201c;What was running through your head?&#x201d; � &#x201c;Tell me more!&#x201d; <br> As you go deeper, be prepared to find out fascinating things you never knew or could have guessed about the other person. Heck, they&#x2019;ll find out fascinating things about themselves they never knew, because they haven&#x2019;t been asking themselves thought-provoking questions like that.</p><h2>The Water of Life: Initiation and the Tempering of the Soul</h2><p>In response to demand for a new edition of The Water of Life, Michael Meade has revised and refined the classic text and added a new preface that addresses the important issue of men and violence in modern culture. As a recent reader remarked, This book is even more prescient and important at this critical point in the world than when it was first published. At once a mythic journey, a study in depth psychology and a treatise on initiation, Meade mines ancient stories, finding wisdom and guidance for the turbulent times in which we live. Throughout the text, the water of life functions as a core symbol for both personal and cultural renewal, and for the redemption of nature from a wasteland condition. Using ideas gleaned from many years of cutting-edge work with at-risk youth and oppressed communities, Meade&#39;s writing has the ring of lived truth.</p><p>Weaving a rhythm through images, storyteller &amp; drummer Michael Meade takes you on a journey of descent &amp; healing. In order to effect a deep change in the psyche &amp; reach the "Water of Life," one must pass through the gates of suffering. Unravelling the details of two ageless stories, Meade illustrates this timeless theme of rejuvenation through the acknowledgement of loss. Topics: the creative function of sorrow, the importance of stopping, breaking through denial, listening to small voices, &amp; much moreA mythic tapestry of multicultural stories that encourages both women and men to examine their own lives and find seeds of initiatory and healing experiences that can become the threads of meaningful community.&#x201c;Michael Meade&#x2019;s writing sings with an incantational voice. His book is rich with insights, marvelous in its tales, and full of heart. It takes you right to the edge of elemental knowledge. What a piece of work!&#x201d; - James Hillman &#x201c;Magical and profound, unlike anyone else one is likely to encounter, Michael Meade is one of the greatest living teachers of our time.&#x201d; - Alice Walker &#x201c;The Water of Life is an astonishing book. Michael Meade has a genius for metaphorical thinking, and the stamina of a diver. He rescues six great stories from the Celtic, African, and European past so they can be part of the emotional life of contemporary men and women. Woven through the book we also find an account of his own repeated refusal to obey orders during the Vietnam War, and what he paid for that. This story alone is worth the price of the book.&#x201d; - Robert Bly &#x201c;Michael Meade, masterful storyteller, draws on the power of myths, fairy tales, and his own personal story of descent and transformation in order to speak to men. His is a bones-laid-bare viewpoint&#x2014;fierce, though, and loving. Women will find it useful to listen in as men struggle to come to terms with issues of power, wounds, violence, passion, love, and more.&#x201d; - Clarissa Pinkola Estes &#x201c;With his unyielding commitment to truth and bringing cultures together, Michael Meade captures the power of ancient oral discourse... What emerges is an enchanting concert of rhythm, images, and words.&#x201d; - Malidoma Some &#x201c;There are whole universes curled up in Michael Meade&#x2019;s stories and ideas. He invites the ancient and perennial for these modern tumultuous times, characterized by spiritual rootlessness and deep loss. The Water of Life is a classic text that opens doors of imagination and possibility&#x2014;doors of renewal and reckoning. The Water of Life carries us over a threshold into a dance of dreams, words, and images.&#x201d; - Luis J.

While no book on the subject could be exhaustive, <em>The Bathhouse at Midnight</em> does describe and assess all the literary sources of magic, witchcraft, astrology, alchemy, and divination from Kiev Rus and Imperial Russia, and to some extent Ukraine and Belorussia. Where possible, Ryan identifies the sources of the texts (usually Greek, Arabic, or West European) and makes parallels to other cultures, ranging from classical antiquity to Finnic. He finds that Russia shares most of its magic and divination with the rest of Europe.</p><p>Subjects covered include the Evil Eye, the Number of the Beast, omens, dreams, talismans and amulets, plants, gemstones, and other materials thought to possess magic properties. The first chapter gives a historical overview, and the final chapter summarizes the political, religious, and legal aspects of the history of magic in Russia. The author also provides translations of some key texts.</p><p><em>The Bathhouse at Midnight</em> will be invaluable for anyone&#x2014;student, teacher, or general reader&#x2014;with an interest in Russia, magic, or the occult. It is unique in its field and is set to become the definitive study of Russian magic.</p></p><p><p>W. F. Ryan is academic librarian of the Warburg Institute at the University of London, School of Advanced Studies. He has published widely on the subject of magic in Russia and is co-author of the <em>Penguin Russian Dictionary</em> (1995) and co-editor of numerous scholarly books, including <em>Anglo-Russian Relations in the Age of Peter the Great</em> (1998).</p>&#x201c;A work of encyclopedic proportions, <i>The Bathhouse at Midnight </i>is sure to be the standard reference on Russian magic for years to come. For being essentially a catalogue, the book reads very smoothly. . . . Thus, this book can be read from cover to cover or, with the detailed table of contents and the index, it can be used to look up a particular phenomenon or beliefs. It will make a fine textbook, and for mature scholars, this is not only a valuable reference tool, but piece of scholarship very much worth emulating.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Natalie Kononenko, <i>Russian Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;William Ryan&#x2019;s ambitious volume attempts a comprehensive survey of manifestations of magic throughout Russian history. . . . The result is a veritable encyclopedia of magical phenomena and beliefs, drawn from an extensive range of sources, but particularly from medieval texts and ethnographic data collected in the nineteenth century. . . . Ryan&#x2019;s book is a tour de force. It is likely to remain the fundamental reference work on magic in Russia for generations to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Eve Levin, <i>Slavic Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Bathhouse at Midnight </i>is an excellent study and source book of Russian supernatural and magical beliefs that should be read by anyone working with Russian supernatural belief, with the comparative study of belief&#x2014;whether Slavic, European, or Indo-European&#x2014;or with Christian folk religion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;David E. Gay, <i>Journal of Folklore Research</i><br><br>&#x201c;Ryan&#x2019;s master work now provides a thorough, well-documented survey of an extremely rich and fascinating area and constitutes an invitation to any serious student of magic and its practice to consider entering this previously uncharted territory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Bruce McClelland, <i>History of Religions</i><br><br>&#x201c;The breath of its grasp, the depth of its treatment of specific subjects, and the good judgment and erudition Ryan displays throughout make it an essential reference book for Slavists and folklorists.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Linda Ivantis, <i>Folklorica</i><br><br>&#x201c;All in all, Ryan&#x2019;s book is a marvelous contribution to Slavic studies. It is great fun to read as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Linda Ivantis, <i>Folklorica</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Bathhouse at Midnight </i>remains, nonetheless, an outstanding compilation of magic and its associated beliefs in Russia, as well as their relations to Western forms.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Jennifer B.

Since then, the interest rate swaps and other derivative markets have grown and diversified in phenomenal directions. Derivatives are used today by a myriad of institutional investors for the purposes of risk management, expressing a view on the market, and pursuing market opportunities that are otherwise unavailable using more traditional financial instruments. In this volume, Howard Corb explores the concepts behind interest rate swaps and the many derivatives that evolved from them. <br><br>Corb's book uniquely marries academic rigor and real-world trading experience in a compelling, readable style. While it is filled with sophisticated formulas and analysis, the volume is geared toward a wide range of readers searching for an in-depth understanding of these markets. It serves as both a textbook for students and a must-have reference book for practitioners. Corb helps readers develop an intuitive feel for these products and their use in the market, providing a detailed introduction to more complicated trades and structures. Through examples of financial structuring, readers will come away with an understanding of how derivatives products are created and how they can be deconstructed and analyzed effectively.</p><p>Howard Corb is an adjunct associate professor in finance and economics at Columbia Business School and a partner at Arel Capital. After receiving his Ph.D. in finance from Stanford University, he began his Wall Street career at J. P. Morgan and later joined Morgan Stanley, during which time he worked with a variety of institutional clients to help manage their interest rate risk using derivatives.Howard Corb's comprehensive treatment of interest rate swaps and related derivatives is destined to be the standard source for all professionals and students anxious to learn both concepts and practice. This book is authoritative, accessible, and rich with applications and illustrative examples. (Darrell Duffie, Stanford University)<br><br>Finally, a complete and comprehensive derivative textbook that is both commercial and quantitative. This book is written in a wonderful conversational manner that will appeal to students of many derivative applications&#x2015;corporations of all sizes, institutional investors of all kinds, public sector borrowers, global regulators, quants and educators at all levels. Howard Corb has really captured everything&#x2015;the broad array of products and the necessary maths and associated variables&#x2015;covering both common applications along with all the nuances. Undoubtedly this book will serve as both a textbook for the inquisitive and a reference book for all practitioners. I have grown with the swaps and derivatives market for the last quarter century and would have valued having this book at my side on many occasions. I commend Corb for creating such an inclusive work. His book clearly captures his passion for the derivatives market and his sincere interest in education.

In working toward the new standards, kids are going to be doing hard things. But children can still write for reasons that matter. This is not inconsistent with the goals of the Common Core State Standards."</em><br> <strong>-Gretchen Owocki</strong></p> <p>"My goal with <em>The Common Core Writing Book</em>," writes Gretchen Owocki, "is to support K-5 teachers as they provide differentiated instruction in relation to the ten Common Core writing standards." Gretchen presents a comprehensive framework of strategies that help you choose the best path for meeting students' needs and the Common Core standards.</p> <p>As she did for reading in the bestselling <em>Common Core Lesson Book</em>, Gretchen empowers teachers with information and proven practices. She breaks the writing anchor standards into manageable chunks, emphasizing differentiation, engagement, and writing for authentic purposes. She offers: </p> <ul> <li>a clear description of what each standard asks from students</li> <li>instructional decision trees that connect assessment to planning</li> <li>instructional strategies that gradually release responsibility to students</li> <li>suggestions for tailoring support to meet students' individual needs.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>"Because effective teaching does not emerge from a mandate, a state office, or a manual," writes Gretchen Owocki, "we must avoid paths that cast educators as secondary decision makers or that offer quick solutions or static packages." Whether you turn to <em>The Common Core Writing Book</em> to enhance your current curriculum or to design your own, Gretchen Owocki will help you create instruction that is standards focused and student centered.</p></p><p><p>Gretchen Owocki powerfully demonstrates the importance of bringing meaningful instruction to not only traditional reading-instruction topics like comprehension, but also to contemporary issues such as Common Core and RTI. In the bestselling titles The Common Core Writing Book, 6-8; The Common Core Reading Book, 6-8; The Common Core Lesson Book, K-5; The Common Core Writing Book, K-5; and The RTI Daily Planning Book, she masterfully breaks down instructional issues and strategies into manageable chunks that help teachers differentiate instruction, meet curricular goals, and improve as practitioners. For more than 15 years, she has helped teachers find researched-based practices that improve learning by letting students experience curriculum as part of their own development. In other Heinemann titles such as Comprehension; Make Way for Literacy; and Time for Literacy Centers, she shares teaching that engages students through authentic, meaningful tasks and challenges them to grow as readers and writers.

Written with a sense of piety and awe for the majesty and sanctity of the biblical text, it conveys the content of the Five Book of Moses in language that is easy to read and understand. The message of the Bible is ageless, but for full comprehension, it must be presented in language suited to the time and place of the reader. Scharfstein's fluent, idiomatic translation does exactly this"replacing the ancient robes of 4000 years ago in which the Torah was given on Sinai with up-to-date garments of the 21st century that preserve its inner essence but make it familiar and "user-friendly." The English translation is presented side by side with the original text, making this volume an excellent tool for those who are learning biblical Hebrew. The weekly readings and their divisions are all clearly designated, and each book of the Torah is preceded by a brief introduction that explains its most important aspects.<br>All in all, this new translation will prove to be an invaluable tool in Jewish education and an essential addition to the home library of every Jewish family.<br>Sol Scharfstein is the author of numerous children's books and Jewish educational texts, including . . . , as well as a very popular new translation of the Passover Haggadah with full instructions and a traditional commentary.</p><p>The Torah--the first five books of the Hebrew Bible--are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. It is a unique combination of narrative and law, read in synagogues by a trained reader from a parchment scroll written with meticulous care by an authorized, pious scribe, and the reading constitutes a central part of the synagogue service. Scharfstein begins with a brief history of the Torah, the <i>Targum</i> (the Aramaic translation of the Torah), and the two Torah holidays. He discusses the Torah's ornaments and setting, its ceremonies and honors, and he gives a short introduction to each book that explains its most important aspects. The author, who is also the author of numerous children's books and Jewish educational texts, has written a lucid and comprehensible translation. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She compiled and shared with early AAs and their families the materials comprising early A.A.&#39;s spiritual program--the Bible, Quiet Time, the teachings of Sam Shoemaker, the principles of the Oxford Group, and Christian literature of the day. This priceless source of information about where A.A. came from, what it did in the early days, and what its ideas mean has been presented concisely and thoroughly by author Dick B. This is the third edition.</p><p>Undoubtedly the most forgotten, least quoted, and least understood of early A.A.&#39;s six major spiritual roots is Anne Smith&#39;s Journal. Anne Ripley Smith was the wife of A.A.&#39;s co-founder Dr. Bob. She was called by A.A.&#39;s other co-founder Bill Wilson a &#34;founder&#34; of A.A. and the &#34;Mother of A.A..&#34; It was she who read the Bible daily to Dr. Bob and Bill during the summer of 1935 when Bill was living with the Smiths and the spiritual recovery principles of A.A. were being developed. It was she, beginning in 1933, who recorded the basic ideas from the Bible, the Oxford Group&#39;s life-changing program, the Quiet Time practices, the Christian literature, and the practical ideas for depending upon God that became part and parcel of the A.A. Twelve Steps and A.A.&#39;s Fellowship. Anne assembled these in her journal from 1933 to 1939. She read from this journal and used it as a basis for discussion from A.A.&#39;s earliest Quiet Time days at the Smith home in Akron. Anne was declared to be the one who gave Bill W. and Dr. Bob a much needed &#34;spiritual infusion.&#34; She attended all pioneer meetings. She acted as house-mother, nurse, evangelist, counselor, and employment agent for A.A. pioneers and their families. To know what Anne Smith wrote and was teaching is to know the real heart of early A.A.&#39;s spiritual ideas and program.

In this shorter commentary Thiselton draws on his excellent exegesis from that volume but combines it afresh with keen practical and pastoral application for readers at all levels. Thiselton delves deeply into the context and text of Paul&#39;s first Corinthian letter as he suggests, section by section, how the book applies to pastoral and practical issues. He draws vivid parallels between the growing church in Corinth and the twenty-first-century church, demonstrating that today&#39;s church also faces a seductive culture of competition and consumerism. The church in Corinth preferred its self-centered theology to the Christ-centered gospel of the wider apostolic church. Paul&#39;s response in 1 Corinthians, amplified by Thiselton&#39;s commentary, becomes a living, practical, transforming word from God for Christians today.</p><p>Anthony C. Thiselton is professor emeritus of Christian theology at the University of Nottingham, England.Walter Moberly - Durham University &#34;Lucidly, accessibly, and engagingly, Thiselton brings alive the subject matter about which St. Paul writes. Thus, this commentary searchingly illuminates the nature of Christian lifestyle and spirituality today.&#34; Craig L. Blomberg - Denver Seminary &#34;In his 1400-page NIGTC volume on 1 Corinthians, Anthony Thiselton explained that he addressed every legitimate question he could think of that someone might ask of the text! The result was a masterpiece, but one that few readers will ever fully scrutinize. In a new labor of love, Thiselton has now created this marvelous digest, at the same time interacting with the newest round of research, adding applicational gems into his exegesis, and inserting thoughtful questions for reflection and implementation at the end of each section. This will immediately become the main text for my English Bible 1 Corinthians elective.&#34; Review of Biblical Literature &#34;This is a superb pastoral commentary. It is one that a pastor could use for exegetical as well as pastoral information within a sermon... This commentary provides a good model of exegetical and pastoral writing and is well worth having on the shelf of anyone working in ministry.&#34;</p><h2>Spawn: Origins Volume 10 (Spawn, 57-62)</h2><p><ul> <li>Cy-Gor's arduous hunt for Spawn reaches its pinnacle in a fierce battle in the alleys.

His chiseled face had a two-day scrub of beard. Behind black sunglasses, dark circles hung under sleep-deprived eyes.</p><p>He wore a Philadelphia Eagles ball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt with the red TEMPLE UNIVERSITY logotype. Concealed inside the waistband of his blue jeans, at the small of his back, was an Officer&#x2019;s Model Colt&nbsp;.45 ACP semiautomatic pistol. And in his back pocket, in a black leather bifold holder, were his badge and the Philadelphia Police Department&#x2013;issued card identifying him as a sergeant of the Homicide Unit.</p><p>Taking the subway, which Payne had boarded at the City Hall station after paying the $2.25 fare, hadn&#x2019;t been his first&#x2014;or his second&#x2014;choice. But considering his options at the time, it had seemed the fastest.</p><p>And with leads in the killings all but dried up, he had no time to waste.</p><p>After exiting the concourse, he took the steps, two at a time, up to street level, then started across the deep gray slush of snow and melted ice that covered the sidewalk.</p><p>At the newsstand shack on the southeast corner of Erie and Broad, he quickly tugged a newspaper from a stack topped with a chunk of red brick, stuffing it beneath his left arm, then peeling from his money clip a pair of dollar bills. He handed the cash to the attendant&#x2014;a heavily clothed elderly black man with leathery hands and a deeply wrinkled face and thin beard&#x2014;and gestured for him to keep the change.</p><p>Payne turned and glanced around the busy intersection.</p><p>The storefronts were a blend of bars and fast-food chain restaurants, banks and pharmacies, barbershops and convenience stores. Payne thought that the facades of the aged buildings, as well as the streets and sidewalks, looked much like he felt&#x2014;tired, worn out.</p><p>On Erie, halfway down the block, Payne saw the coffee shop he was looking for&#x2014;tall stenciled lettering in black and red on its front window read THE DAILY GRIND&#x2014;then grunted.</p><p>On the second floor, above the diner, was a small, locally owned bookstore that had signage advertising WE SHIP TO PRISONS. Directly across the street, a new billboard on a rooftop had in bold lettering REPORT CRIME TIPS! LEX TALIONIS PAYS CASH REWARDS UP TO $20,000&#x2014;800-LEX-TALN, and, in a strip along the billboard&#x2019;s bottom, the wording MAKE A DIFFERENCE&#x2014;BECOME A PHILADELPHIA POLICE OFFICER next to a photograph of the smiling faces of attractive young women and men attending the police academy.</p><p>Payne walked quickly to The Daily Grind.</p><p>As he pulled on the stainless steel handle of the diner&#x2019;s glass door, then started to step inside, he almost collided with a grim-faced heavyset Latina in her twenties carrying three waxed paper to-go coffee cups. He made a thin smile, stepped back, made a grand sweep with his free arm for her to pass through the doorway first, then went inside.</p><p>It was a small space, permeated by the smell of fried grease and coffee. The only seating was at a stainless steel countertop at the back that overlooked the open kitchen. Elsewhere, customers could stand at the nine round high-top tables and at the worn wooden counter that ran at chest height along the side walls and the front windows.</p><p>There were just two customers now, both older men who were seated at opposite ends of the back counter and busy with their meals. An enormous coal-black man in his forties, wearing a grease-stained white apron tied over jeans and a sweaty white T-shirt, stood stooped at the gas-fired grill, his large biceps bulging as he methodically worked a long-handled wire brush back and forth. Flames flared up with each pass.</p><p>The cook stopped, looked over his shoulder, saw Payne, called out, &#x201c;Hey, man, he&#x2019;ll be right with you,&#x201d; then turned back to scrubbing the grill.</p><p>At the far right end of the counter, under a sign reading ORDER HERE/PAY HERE that hung from the ceiling tiles by dust-coated chains, was the cash register. And just beyond it was a faded emerald green wooden door with TOILET FOR PAYING CUST ONLY!! that appeared to have been handwritten in haste with a fat-tipped black ink permanent marker.</p><p>The bathroom door began to swing open, and a brown-skinned male in his late teens stepped out, drying his hands on a paper towel.</p><p>Daquan Williams was five-foot-eight, extremely thin, and, under a ball cap with THE DAILY GRIND in stenciled letters across its front, his shoulder-length wavy reddish-brown hair was tied back with a rubber band. He wore black jeans and a tan T-shirt that was emblazoned with a coarse drawing of the Liberty Bell, its crack exaggerated, and the wording PHILLY&#x2014;NOBODY LIKES US &amp; WE DON&#x2019;T CARE.</p><p>The teenager made eye contact with Payne, nodded just perceptibly, then looked away as he went to the rack of coffeepots. He pulled a heavy china mug from a pyramid-shaped stack, filled it with coffee, then carried it to Payne, who now stood by a window in the front corner of the shop, opposite the door, watching the sidewalk traffic over the top edge of the newspaper as he casually flipped its pages.</p><p>The teenager placed the steaming mug on the wooden counter beside a wire rack containing packets of cream and sugar.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Daquan,&#x201d; Payne said, then yawned widely as he reached for the coffee. &#x201c;I really need this.&#x201d;</p><p>He held out a five-dollar bill.</p><p>Daquan didn&#x2019;t take it. He nodded toward the enormous cook cleaning the grill.</p><p>&#x201c;Boss man say you don&#x2019;t pay,&#x201d; he said, keeping his voice low so as not to be overheard.</p><p>&#x201c;I appreciate that, but I like to pay my way.&#x201d;</p><p>Payne put the money on the counter, then sipped the coffee.</p><p>Daquan nodded. He took the bill.</p><p>Payne glanced at Daquan&#x2019;s left ear. What looked like a new diamond stud sparkled in the lobe. Payne considered mentioning it, but instead gently rattled the newspaper cover page.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Payne said quietly, &#x201c;what do you know on this hit?&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan&#x2019;s eyes shifted to the front page of the newspaper, and his facial expression changed to one of frustration.</p><p>The photograph showed, behind yellow tape imprinted with POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS, two members of the medical examiner&#x2019;s office standing at the rear of a white panel van. They were in the process of lifting through the van&#x2019;s back doors a gurney holding a full body bag. Splashed across the image was the headline: #360. ANOTHER MURDER, ANOTHER RECORD.</p><p>The teenager, head down, quickly turned on his heel and marched to the cash register. He punched in the coffee, made change, then carefully closed the cash drawer as he scanned the front door and windows. Then, from beneath the register, he pulled out the busboy cart and rolled it to the front of the diner.</p><p>&#x201c;Your change,&#x201d; he said in a normal voice, holding the money out to Payne.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your tip. Keep it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan stuffed it in the front pocket of his jeans as he immediately turned his back to Payne. He busied himself clearing the small plates and cups from the nearest high-top table.</p><p>&#x201c;What about the drive-by?&#x201d; Payne pursued, again speaking quietly as he flipped pages.</p><p>&#x201c;I really can&#x2019;t say,&#x201d; Daquan replied, almost in a whisper, without turning around.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t?&#x201d; Payne said. &#x201c;Or won&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Peeps talk, they get capped. That&#x2019;s what happened to Pookie. Law of the street. That&#x2019;s why I texted you now, after they came&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who did it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Capped Pookie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just it&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said, then looked over his shoulder at Payne. &#x201c;Matt, I didn&#x2019;t even know the dude. They&#x2019;re threatening me over something I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any guess who did do it?&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan turned back to busing the table and shrugged again.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard word that King Two-One-Five knows,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Payne thought: <i>Tyrone Hooks knows&#x2014;or ordered it done?</i></p><p>He pulled his cell phone from the back pocket of his jeans, rapidly thumb-typed and sent a short text message, then tucked the phone back.</p><p>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s the last time you saw your parole officer, Daquan?&#x201d; he said, picking the newspaper back up.</p><p>&#x201c;Few days ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It go okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s school coming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hard, man. Just real hard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One day at a time. You&#x2019;ll get that GED.&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan then pulled a hand towel and a spray bottle of cleaner from the cart and began wiping the tabletop.</p><p>Payne said, &#x201c;Nice diamond stud. Is it real?&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan stopped wiping.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh. S&#x2019;posed to be, anyway,&#x201d; he said, made two more slow circles, and added, &#x201c;Got my momma something nice for Christmas, and this earring, it was part of the deal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan grunted.</p><p>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; he said, then moved to the next table. &#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;m trying to get my life straight, staying away from the street. You think I like busing tables? Only gig I could find.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. Remember?&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, of course I remember. You know I appreciate the help, man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your nose clean, make it through the probation period, and we&#x2019;ll work on getting your record cleared. Have the charge expunged. Then we&#x2019;ll find you something else. Right now, this is good, honest work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should be proud. Your mother told me she is. Especially now, after Dante&#x2019;s death&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>At the mention of his cousin, Daquan looked over his shoulder at Payne.</p><p>Payne saw deep sadness in his eyes. They glistened, and it was obvious that he was fighting back tears.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get past that, Matt. We were real close, you know, going way back. Now he&#x2019;s gone, and I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; He looked down and rubbed his eyes. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m really not here. I&#x2019;m just a shell walking around.&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan lifted his head, looked at Payne&#x2014;then his eyes immediately looked past Payne, out the window.</p><p>Payne saw the sadness in Daquan&#x2019;s face suddenly replaced with fear.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; Daquan said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re back!&#x201d;</p><p>He grabbed the busboy cart and started pushing it quickly to the back of the diner.</p><p>Just then, as Payne turned and looked out the window, the glass front door swung open.</p><p>Two teenaged black males wearing thick dark parkas marched in, the first one, tall and burly, raising a black semiautomatic pistol in his right fist.</p><p>Payne dropped the newspaper and quickly reached behind his back to pull his&nbsp;.45 out from under his sweatshirt.</p><p>Daquan shoved the busboy cart at the pair and then jumped behind the back counter as the tall, burly teenager fired three shots.</p><p>The sound of gunfire in the small diner was deafening.</p><p>Payne leveled his pistol at the shooter as he shouted, &#x201c;Stop! Police! Don&#x2019;t move!&#x201d;</p><p>The ringing in Payne&#x2019;s ears caused his words to sound odd.</p><p>The tall, burly teenager turned and tried to aim at Payne.</p><p>Payne instinctively responded by squeezing off two rounds in rapid succession.</p><p>The heavy 230-grain bullets of the specially loaded&nbsp;.45 ACP cartridges left the muzzle at a velocity of 1,300 feet per second, and almost instantly hit the shooter square in the chest. Upon impact and penetration, the copper-jacketed lead hollow points, as designed, mushroomed and then fragmented, the pieces ripping through the teen&#x2019;s upper torso.</p><p>The shooter staggered backward to the wall, dropping the gun when he struck the wooden counter there.</p><p>The second teenager, who had frozen in place at the firing of the first shots, immediately turned and bolted back out the glass door.</p><p>The shooter slid to the floor.</p><p>As Payne rushed for the door, he kicked the shooter&#x2019;s gun toward the back counter. The two customers there were lying on the floor in front of it. The one to the left was curled up in the corner with his back to Payne and, almost comically, shielding his head by holding a white plate over it. The one on the right was facedown and still. Blood soaked the back of his shirt.</p><p>The enormous cook, who had ducked below the counter, now peered wide-eyed over its top.</p><p>Payne shouted, &#x201c;Call nine-one-one!&#x201d; then threw open the door and ran out.</p><p>Daquan, blood on his right hand as he gripped his left upper arm, crawled out from beneath the cash register.</p><p>Daquan hesitated a moment before moving toward the shooter, who was motionless. He picked up the small-frame semiautomatic pistol from the floor.</p><p>The cook stood and shouted, &#x201c;Daquan, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d;</p><p>Daquan went out the door.</p><p>He turned right and took off down the sidewalk, following Payne.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The storefronts along Erie Avenue gave way to a decaying neighborhood of older row houses. Daquan Williams watched the teenager dart into traffic and dodge vehicles as he ran across Erie, headed in the direction of a series of three or four overgrown vacant lots where row houses had once stood.</p><p>He saw that Matt Payne, arms and legs pumping as he picked up speed, was beginning to close the distance between them.</p><p>&#x201c;Police! Stop!&#x201d; Payne yelled again.</p><p>The teenager made it to the first lot off Thirteenth Street, then disappeared into an overgrowth of bushes at the back of it.</p><p>Payne, moments later, reached the bushes, cautiously pushed aside limbs, swept the space with his pistol, and then entered.</p><p>Daquan started to cross Erie but heard a squeal of brakes and then a truck horn begin blaring. He slid to a stop, narrowly missing being hit by a delivery box truck. It roared past, its huge tires splashing his pants and shoes with road slush from a huge pothole. A car and a small pickup closely following the truck honked as they splashed past.</p><p>Daquan finally found a gap in traffic and made his way across.</p><p>He ran to the bushes, then went quickly into them, limbs wet with snow slapping at him. One knocked his cap off. The dim light made it hard to see. After a long moment, he came out the other side, to another open lot. He saw Payne, who had run across another street, just as he disappeared into another clump of overgrowth at the back of another vacant lot between row houses.</p><p>While Daquan ran across that street to follow, a dirty-brown four-door Ford Taurus pulled to the curb in front of the row house bordering the lot. Daquan dodged the sedan, running behind it, then started across the lot.</p><p>Ahead, from somewhere in the overgrowth, he heard Matt Payne once again shouting, &#x201c;Stop! Police!&#x201d;</p><p>This time, though, was different.</p><p>Almost immediately there came a rapid series of shots&#x2014;the first three sounding not quite as loud as the final two.</p><p>Daquan ...</p></p><h2>The Good Funeral: Death, Grief, and the Community of Care</h2><p><p>Two of the most authoritative voices on the funeral industry come together here in one volume to discuss the current state of the funeral.

They were so grateful when we would show up at the hospital or nursing home or family home in the middle of the night, so grateful for the way we handled their dead carefully and with respect. Or leaving after a long day's visitation at the funeral home, when a widow would hold me by the shoulders and tell me how very comforting it was to have us parking the cars and holding the doors and taking the coats and casseroles, directing folks to the proper parlor and bringing the flowers and for 'just being there.' Or turning from the graveside once everything that could be done had been done, how they would shake my hand or hug me and thank me profusely because 'we couldn't have done this without you . . . thank you. . .

In God Dwells with Us, Mary Coloe crosses the centuries through John&#39;s Gospel text and plunges into the experience of the Johannine community. Here, readers receive a sense of God&#39;s indwelling as promised by Jesus, and how it relates to the symbol of the Temple in the gospel narrative.In the years after the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple, the Johannine community looked to the symbol of the Temple as a key means of expressing its new faith in Jesus. During his lifetime he was the living presence of Israel&#39;s God dwelling in history. In the absence of the historical Jesus, the believing community - past, present, and future - continue to be a locus for the divine indwelling and so can truly be called a living Temple.God Dwells with Us offers a new and consistent perspective on the symbol of the Temple which clarifies the christology of the Fourth Gospel. It establishes a new plot for this gospel - the destroying and raising of the Temple; and shows how this occurs within the text. The chapters provide a new approach to its structure. It is unique in its treatment of John14:2 where it establishes that the new Temple is the household of believers on earth. It also presents a new interpretation of the Johannine Crucifixion and the scene with Jesus&#39; mother and the Beloved Disciple.Chapters are God&#39;s Dwelling Place in Israel,&#34; &#34;The Temple of His Body: 2:13-15,&#34; &#34;The Supplanter: 4:1-45,&#34;&#34;The Tabernacling Presence of God: 7:1-8:59,&#34; &#34;The Consecrated One: 10:22-42,&#34; &#34;My Father&#39;s House 14:1-31,&#34; and &#34;Raising the New Temple: 18:1-19:42.&#34;Mary L.

Her books include God Dwells with Us: Temple Symbolism in the Fourth Gospel and Dwelling in the Household of God: Johannine Ecclesiology and Spirituality (both from Liturgical Press).This is an insightful and persuasive study that will interest specialists in the gospel of John and everyone concerned about Jewish-Christian relations in the earliest decades of the Christian movement.<i>Religious Studies Review</i><br><br>This perceptive study takes readers into the heart of John's gospel by focusing on a cluster of its major symbols. Sanctuary images offer engaging perspectives on Christ's incarnation, death and resurrection, and on life within the Christian community.

He cannot simply plateau at an acceptable level of dabbling in forbidden sex for one simple reason: wrong sexual pleasure never satisfies. Yesterday&#x2019;s five minutes of soft porn becomes today&#x2019;s hour of hardcore, and, while the future is unpredictable, one certainty remains &#x2013; his addictive behavior will escalate. <br> <br> <i>The Pursuit of Porneia</i> is a review of the culture of sexual addiction and a biblical pathway to recovery. The book highlights the work of 423 Men, an addiction recovery program based on Solomon&#x2019;s 3,000-year old mandate recorded in Proverbs 4.23: <br> <br> <i>&#x201c;Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>The Pursuit of Porneia</i> is not about stopping the addict&#x2019;s bad sexual behavior. It&#x2019;s about helping him discover the reasons for his bad sexual behavior. The intended byproduct of both the book and 423 Men is sexual sobriety, but that is not the focus of recovery. The program is designed, rather, to help members find out why they do what they do. This journey of self-discovery is the starting point for a man trying to wrench himself free from the spirit of porneia and its destructive grip. <br> <br> A man caught in the web of sexual addiction must find the courage and humility to seek help and address the underlying negative emotions which have historically contributed to his addictive pattern of relapse. He can overcome sexual sin, but he cannot do it alone. He needs Jesus and his brothers in recovery. <br> <br> There is hope. <br> _________________________________________ <br><br> &#x201c;Dave&#x2019;s Scriven&#x2019;s work with 423 has been the single most effective tool for sexual healing in our church, bar none. Hundreds of men have discovered freedom like never before. Not surprisingly, it&#x2019;s also one of the best spiritual formation tools I know of.

Why has the US Supreme Court discovered a constitutional right to same-sex "marriage", which until a decade ago, was unheard of in the history of Western or any other civilization? Where has the "gay rights" movement come from, and how has it so easily conquered America?</p><p>The answers are in the dynamics of the rationalization of sexual misbehavior. The power of rationalization&#x2015;the means by which one mentally transforms wrong into right&#x2015;drives the gay rights movement, gives it its revolutionary character, and makes its advocates indefatigable. The homosexual cause moved naturally from a plea for tolerance to cultural conquest because the security of its rationalization requires universal acceptance. In other words, we all must say that the bad is good.</p><p>At stake in the rationalization of homosexual behavior is reality itself, which is why it will have consequences that reach far beyond the issue at hand. Already America's major institutions have been transformed&#x2015;its courts, its schools, its military, its civic institutions, and even its diplomacy. The further institutionalization of homosexuality will mean the triumph of force over reason, thus undermining the very foundations of the American Republic.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert R.

With profound lessons regarding the intersection of social forces and individual choices, Black succeeds in putting a human face on some of the most important public policy issues of our time.</p><p><b>Timothy Black </b>is an associate professor of sociology and the interim director of the Social Justice Institute at Case Western Reserve University.Introduction<br>&nbsp;<br>Some memories don't fade with time. Sixteen years ago I returned home from the university in the inattentive manner that accompanies daily routine, pushed the message button on my answering machine, and began shuffling around the kitchen to start dinner. As I peered into the refrigerator, the third message rolled up, &#x201c;Tim, it&#x2019;s Fausto, I fucked up, I'm in jail, come see me.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Fausto Rivera was among a group of young men I had met three years before, in 1990, while evaluating a school dropout prevention program in Springfield, Massachusetts. Very rapidly, our relationship spilled out of the schools and onto the basketball courts and neighborhood streets of Springfield, where we spent hours talking about our lives. Fausto was engaging and inquisitive&#x2014;qualities that seemed to stand in sharp contrast to his inability to read or write. The determination of this fifteen-year-old boy was expressed one spring afternoon: "We got a saying in Spanish, '<i>La fe mueve las monta�as.</i>' It means hope moves mountains." One year later, Fausto left school and became more deeply involved in Springfield's underground drug economy. At eighteen, addicted to heroin, he went on a ten-week robbing spree that ended in a failed bank heist and a ten-to-twelve year prison sentence.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fausto's life carves out a unique pathway; after all, it is <i>his </i>life, based upon a series of events, choices, and contingencies. Yet, despite the particulars of Fausto's story, many others have taken similar paths&#x2014;their lives exist within the social grooves that are created and reproduced through public policy, economic opportunities, social institutions, and cultural practices. These pathways developed within the context of Springfield's deepening crisis for Puerto Rican youth in the early 1990s. The number of Puerto Ricans in Springfield nearly doubled in the 1980s and the median age of the population was merely twenty-one (twelve years younger than the white population in Springfield). The Puerto Rican school dropout rate in the late 1980s was around 50 percent, as was Springfield's Hispanic poverty rate. And <i>then </i>the recession hit. At the height of the 1991 recession, the formal unemployment rate in Springfield reached 10 percent, dimming future job prospects for Puerto Rican youths and prompting one Springfield leader to refer to Fausto's cohort as the "lost generation." Not surprisingly, street activity escalated during this period and exploded into gang warfare in 1994. Fausto was just one of many. By the time Fausto was released from prison in 2000, the Massachusetts inmate population had more than quadrupled in the prior twenty years and Latinos were being incarcerated at more than six times the rate of whites. <br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, the social currents that shaped the lives of young Puerto Ricans in Springfield did not deposit Fausto's entire generation in Massachusetts jails. In fact, the economic recovery that began in 1991 and lasted for a decade eased oppressive conditions in Springfield. Some of the men, including Julio Rivera, Fausto's older brother, left the street economy and found jobs in the expanding labor force. In 2007, Julio had been driving a tractor- trailer for more than ten years and had secured a unionized job that paid nearly $20 an hour, while his wife worked as a bank teller. As testimony to their success, they became homeowners in 2006, albeit two years before their variable interest rate jumped and they joined the millions of homeowners trying to hold on to their homes amidst the subprime mortgage crisis.<br>&nbsp;<br>Getting to this stage in Julio's life, however, had not been easy, nor had it followed a straight trajectory. In the early 1990s, out of work and desperate, Julio held a gun to the head of a novice drug dealer and robbed him of $5,000. In the heat of Springfield's gang wars, he was made "godfather of the Warlords" by the street gang La Familia. His transition from the streets to working- class stability depended on a number of contingent factors, including his access to job information about the trade from an informal network of men who hung out nightly on "the block," the deregulation of the trucking industry in 1980, which opened up more driving jobs for Latinos, and the tight labor market in the late 1990s. <br>&nbsp;<br>Also no stranger to "the block," the youngest and most street involved of the Rivera brothers, Sammy, negotiated these circumstances in Springfield somewhat differently. Foundering in schools in Yonkers, New York, during their court-ordered school desegregation initiatives in the 1980s, Sammy gravitated to the streets at an early age, escaping the radar of his parents and brothers. By the time the Riveras reached Springfield, Sammy had already acquired a delinquent identity that provided peer status and respect in a world lacking in these opportunities. Living in one of Springfield's most ethnically isolated and neglected neighborhoods, Sammy made street connections quickly and his budding street identity was nurtured by one of Springfield's drug kingpins, who would become his mentor. Heroin-addicted and gang-involved in the early 1990s, Sammy ironically managed to avoid prison until he had begun to "age off " the streets in his late twenties.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, Sammy's life straddles the streets and the low-wage economy. He completed a three- year prison stint in 2005 for a drug arrest, after which he moved back in with his partner and their child. Upon release and branded with a felony conviction, Sammy looked unsuccessfully for work for months. Finally he threw down the gauntlet, insisting that if a manager of an assembly plant didn't hire him, he was "going back to do what I know best." In 2007, he had been working at the plant for nearly two years, where his salary had increased from $8 to $11 an hour, but without employee benefits. His partner, more stably employed, helped create a family environment where Sammy spent more time with Sammy Jr. and less time on the streets. <br>&nbsp;<br>This book illustrates the interplay of political, economic, and cultural dynamics that shape the lives of the Rivera brothers, their family, and a network of mostly Puerto Rican men, and examines the strategies that they adopt to negotiate their social conditions. To understand the circumstances through which the drama of their lives unfolds, however, we need to consider the political and economic changes that occurred in the latter part of the twentieth century and particularly the backdrop that jobs and prison created in their lives.</p><h2>Surrounded By Sea: Life on a New England Fishing Island</h2><p>Discover what life is like season by season when you&#39;re surrounded by the sea. See the ferry that brings people and supplies to the island and the fisherman preparing their nets for the summer fishing season. Learn about the significance of buoys, the workings of lobster traps, and the variety of boats you can see from the shore.</p><p>Gail Gibbons &#34;has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator,&#34; according to the Washington Post. Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.Grade 1-3-- Gibbons's penchant for creating interesting, informative nonfiction books for young children appears to be fathomless. Here, she opens the world of island living to mainlanders, providing insight into the activities that occupy the islanders' way of life. The informative text and illustrations transcend the seasons and detail the changes that take place there. The uncluttered, cartoonlike illustrations are clearly labeled and show, for example, the various kinds of boats to be found, how a lobster is trapped, the different kinds of nets used in deep sea fishing, and the tiny village itself, nestled among the rocks and dunes. Life on the island is insular, but for those who live there, it is never dull. Bright and cheerful describe the watercolor pictures, and they are in total complement to the brief text on each page. Clean in appearance, the book offers insightful information in a manner as fresh as a sea breeze. It lends itself naturally to units on where and how others live. Children will want to be Surrounded by Sea as soon as they spy the colorful dust jacket. --Mary Lou Budd, Milford South Elementary School, OH<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Expert System&#39;s Brother (The Expert System&#39;s Brother, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Bestselling British master of science fiction Adrian Tchaikovsky brings readers a new, mind-expanding science fantasia in <i>The Expert System's Brother</i></b></p><p>After an unfortunate accident, Handry is forced to wander a world he doesn&#x2019;t understand, searching for meaning.

But on May 31 of that year, a white mob, inflamed by rumors that a young black man had attempted to rape a white teenage girl, invaded Greenwood. By the end of the following day, thousands of homes and businesses lay in ashes, and perhaps as many as three hundred people were dead.<br><br><i>Tulsa, 1921</i> shines new light into the shadows that have long been cast over this extraordinary instance of racial violence. With the clarity and descriptive power of a veteran journalist, author Randy Krehbiel digs deep into the events and their aftermath and investigates decades-old questions about the local culture at the root of what one writer has called a white-led pogrom.<br><br> Krehbiel analyzes local newspaper accounts in an unprecedented effort to gain insight into the minds of contemporary Tulsans. In the process he considers how the <i>Tulsa World</i>, the <i>Tulsa Tribune</i>, and other publications contributed to the circumstances that led to the disaster and helped solidify enduring white justifications for it. Some historians have dismissed local newspapers as too biased to be of value for an honest account, but by contextualizing their reports, Krehbiel renders Tulsa&#x2019;s papers an invaluable resource, highlighting the influence of news media on our actions in the present and our memories of the past.<br><br> The Tulsa Massacre was a result of racial animosity and mistrust within a culture of political and economic corruption. In its wake, black Tulsans were denied redress and even the right to rebuild on their own property, yet they ultimately prevailed and even prospered despite systemic racism and the rise during the 1920s of the second Ku Klux Klan. As Krehbiel considers the context and consequences of the violence and devastation, he asks, Has the city&#x2014;indeed, the nation&#x2014;exorcised the prejudices that led to this tragedy?<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Randy Krehbiel</b> has been a reporter for the <i>Tulsa World </i>since 1979 and now covers political and governmental affairs in Oklahoma and the United States.

You would think by now we&#x2019;d have a satisfactory, universal answer. No such luck...Or maybe we do and we just need to look in the right place. For Dr. Jay Lombard that place is the brain, and more importantly the mind, that center of awareness and consciousness that creates reality.<br><br>In <i>The Mind of God</i>, Dr. Lombard employs case studies from his own behavioral neurology practice to explore the spiritual conundrums that we all ask ourselves: What is the nature of God? Does my life have purpose? What's the meaning of our existence? Are we free? What happens to us when we die?<br><br>For Lombard, these metaphysical questions are a jumping-off point for exploring the brain in search of the seat of the soul. It is neuroscience, the author contends, and how we and our brains interpret what&#x2019;s going on around us that can lead us to a deeper and more fulfilling faith.<br><br> Mixing his personal experiences in the medical field (including compelling cases such as the male patient who really thought he was pregnant and a woman who literally scared herself to death) along with his own visionary insight into spiritual experience, Lombard has much to tell us about the nature and power of belief&#x2014;and what we can do to focus our beliefs in a positive direction. <br>If you want to find more meaning in your life or are searching for a deeper understanding of why we believe what we believe, then this book can lead to an exciting transformation in the way you see and understand the world around you. With cutting-edge research and provocative case studies, renowned behavioral neurologist provides insights to some of the most curious spiritual questions of mortality.</p><p>Dr. Jay Lombard, a Board-certified Neurologist, is the co-founder, chief scientific officer, and medical director for Genomind, a precision medicine company for patients with psychiatric and neurological conditions.

Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we should know the mind of God.</p><p>--Stephen Hawking1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was 1990 and I was in the beginning of my neurology residency. Under the bright fluorescent lights of the pathology lab at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, I stared at the specimen that shimmered slightly on the cutting board. I had examined several brains by then, but this one looked different. At first I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on why.</p><p>The brains had been culled from the crop of patients who&#x2019;d died that week at our busy hospital. The neuropathologist had laid out the brains meticulously, stems and all, in front of us medical residents as she did weekly. Her first task was to weigh this particular brain, and it came in at a mere 1,005 grams, a good 10 percent smaller than normal. I peered down at the label on the cover of the clinical report--Female, 5, Haemophilus meningitis. My stomach sank.</p><p>It was a child&#x2019;s brain.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for that. This was the first pediatric brain I&#x2019;d seen up close. What made my immediate task particularly difficult was that I knew whose brain it was. The brain belonged to a little girl named Sarah. I&#x2019;d seen her only days earlier in the pediatric intensive care unit. A wave of sorrow washed over me, yet I felt another emotion, too--wonder. Sheer wonder. In front of me was the epicenter of Sarah&#x2019;s existence. Every thought this beautiful little girl had ever thought, every dream she&#x2019;d ever dreamed, every hope for a bright and promising future had seemingly originated in this mass of protoplasm. I had to go forward. As is often necessary in my profession, I needed to check these emotions and steel myself for the business at hand. But my mind was on fire. Filled with questions that had no immediate answers.</p><p>When we examined this poor child&#x2019;s brain, we found widespread inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. From her cranial nerves to the base of her spinal cord, we discovered the remnants of the extreme inflammation that had occupied her skull. Sarah had died of textbook meningitis.</p><p>Sarah had had no prior medical history of meningitis, but that didn&#x2019;t surprise me. I knew the disease&#x2019;s onset can be almost apocalyptic. One day Sarah had been a perfectly healthy five-year-old playing at home with her family. The next day she&#x2019;d experienced a headache that progressively grew worse. The headache was accompanied by fatigue, fever, nausea, and a general sense of unwellness. Her parents had given her Children&#x2019;s Tylenol initially and kept her home. (We&#x2019;ve all felt these symptoms from time to time, and there didn&#x2019;t seem to be any reason for alarm.)</p><p>But when Sarah didn&#x2019;t get better after a day, her parents called their pediatrician, who recommended they take Sarah to the emergency room. No one knew at that point that Sarah was teetering at the door of death. Unfortunately, it proved only a short and tragic hop from the ER to the ICU, where Sarah quickly went downhill. Various tests were rapidly performed there in an attempt to find a solution. Then came a sudden attack. Within Sarah&#x2019;s medical records I read the frantic and heartbreaking attempts at resuscitation.</p><p>Patient coded at 4:35 A.M. CPR performed for 45 mins. Epinephrine, dopamine, &amp; external pacemaker. Unable to establish pulse or maintain BP. Patient declared at 5:18 A.M. Attending physician and family notified.&nbsp;</p><p>The words trailed off in my mind. This was finally how Sarah--her brain, at least--had come to the basement path lab. To me.</p><p>I went back to the task at hand. As I sliced into Sarah&#x2019;s brain, I marveled at how it was still a fleshy pink in parts--and that juxtaposition of pink, girlish life against the gray death of sliced brain matter struck me anew as an incomprehensible paradox. I stared at pieces of the brain, and the big questions of life flooded over me even in the midst of my dissection. Could the gross flesh of Sarah&#x2019;s brain really have possessed the whole elaborate fabric of Sarah&#x2019;s very being--her emotions, memories, hopes, and all the intangibles of her existence? To think that this little girl ate, slept, dreamed, imagined, laughed, told jokes, hugged her parents, and formulated her entire conception of the world around her owing to the power of this mere blob of meat. Surely residing within or perhaps beyond the organ of the brain was something greater, an immaterial primary essence of a person that still survived.</p><p>The light above me flickered in the path lab, threatening to darken the table, the brain in front of me. I considered how billions of people cling to the idea of some kind of afterlife.2 Perhaps they are simply deluded or in denial. But what if they aren&#x2019;t? What if an afterlife is actually plausible? What if we could create a case for it using the rigors of science?</p><p>My questions didn&#x2019;t stop there.</p><p>Here I was, a young physician beginning his life&#x2019;s work in a world of objectivity, only evaluating things I could quantify, and I was faced with life&#x2019;s biggest queries: Was there some other truth I needed to find for myself? Surely there had to be something greater to the end of a human being&#x2019;s life than what Hamlet would call &#x201c;bestial oblivion.&#x201d; But what was this &#x201c;something greater&#x201d;? And could I reconcile it with what I knew of science?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What Made Sarah Sarah?</p><p>Fast-forward nearly three decades since that day in the path lab. I find myself still a neurologist steeped in neuroscience, still actively engaged in a concrete world of measurements and data. Yet those questions about something existing beyond flesh and form still persist.</p><p>Simply put, neuroscience is the study of the brain--it is the portal through which we can discover, in the brain&#x2019;s formerly fathomless code, the true nature of our being. Yet we are much more than mere intellect, more than human computers who make decisions. The more I&#x2019;ve discovered about the living brain, the more secrets I&#x2019;ve unearthed about the nature of human beings, the universe, the purpose of our lives, and the possible existence of something beyond all of this. For me, neuroscience isn&#x2019;t just the study of the brain; it is a tool by which we can make the invisible visible. As Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry wrote in his masterpiece The Little Prince: &#x201c;What is essential is invisible to the eye.&#x201d;3 No truer words have ever been written. Through an exploration of our brains, we can discover more about the nature of faith, belief, and hope. Thus, there is logical and rational evidence that can help us answer the big questions of life.</p><p>In the pages to come, I want to take you on a cerebral journey--both literal and figurative--into the depths of the mind, to explore the most important questions about life and how neuroscience may help answer them:</p><p>1. Is there a God?</p><p>2. Do humans have souls?</p><p>3. Are we special? (Meaning, are humans any different from other animals?)</p><p>4. Do we have free will--or is all of life predetermined for us?</p><p>5. What&#x2019;s the meaning of life, and is there any higher purpose for our existence?</p><p>6. Since evil exists so prevalently in the world, can there be such a thing as a good God?</p><p>7. Is there life after death?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These are questions that have long challenged me to search for answers. Certainly, many contemporary neuroscientists will disagree with my conclusions; they&#x2019;ll argue, for instance, that a person&#x2019;s consciousness--the implicit and yet ubiquitous &#x201c;awareness of being&#x201d;--comes down to neurological switches that are flipped on or off, as in an electrical engineering circuit. For many of these intelligent men and women, whatever happens in our mental state is purely a function of physical (neuronal, biological, or electrochemical) reactions. The general belief among scientists, doctors, and other medical professionals is that we are purely material, with no soul to speak of beyond the elementary particles of chemistry and biology. The majority of neuroscientists assert that there is no physical evidence of an existence beyond the flesh, that any person&#x2019;s subjective sense of self as a soul or immaterial being is an illusion, a simulation designed to hide the actual backroom computations and neuronal workings of our brains.</p><p>Yet when discussing these topics with my colleagues, many of the most humble recognize there are gaps in conventional scientific thinking, spaces yet to be filled in the scientific world--and what can fill those gaps leads back to the reality of the intangible. These gaps are referred to as the &#x201c;hard problem of consciousness,&#x201d;4 a term coined by the eminent philosopher of mind David Chalmers to describe the vast chasm between the physical and the phenomenological, between the tangible senses and the suprasensory experience we have of them.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at this a little more closely. While our brains are indeed biological, the experience generated by our brains--our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs--is beyond the observable and measurable. Our subjective perceptions, the qualitative and sentinel aspects of our being, cannot be merely by-products of neurochemical processes. &#x201c;Even if it were able to map out the precise pattern of brain waves that underlie our subjective states, that mapping would only explain the physical correlate of experience, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be them. A person&#x2019;s experiences are as irreducibly real as her brain waves are, and different from them.&#x201d;5 Or to paint another picture, if we are all fish in the fishbowl, how do we observe ourselves outside the fishbowl?</p><p>Consciousness is not something to be feared or dismissed. The Latin roots of the word consciousness mean &#x201c;to know together&#x201d; and hence this distinctly human attribute is a gift that provides us with the capacity to jointly inquire about the meaning of our existence. If we were able to unwrap this gift, we would see that the perceived gaps between flesh and spirit, mind and brain, hide a deeper, intrinsic, and fascinating reality. This reality is an experience of something ineffable--a mind, soul, spirit, or even energy--that which is both irreducibly complex and fundamental to our being.</p><p>Is it what made Sarah Sarah? What makes me me? What makes you you?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Faith in Science</p><p>Now, I am first and foremost a neurologist who is deeply vested in empirical data. I hold great faith in science. I, and millions of other physicians and scientists, have staked our professional careers on the integrity of the scientific method, which has proved to be extremely useful to help predict and manipulate natural, chemical, and biological phenomena. By no means do we want to ignore science in this process of discovery. To the contrary, we want to use science as a stepping-stone to learn and know and grasp all we can about who we are. I realize the very idea that truth can be found both &#x201c;within&#x201d; and &#x201c;beyond&#x201d; science can be difficult, if not impossible, for some people to grasp, particularly for us scientists--remember all those fish in the fishbowl. But with science, faith, and a little bit of reasoning, we can press our faces upon the glass and see that there is something beyond, and it&#x2019;s extraordinary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Science Is the Only Truth?</p><p>As I&#x2019;ve alluded to earlier, there are many who believe that science is the only truth. Yet truth can be found both &#x201c;within&#x201d; science and &#x201c;beyond&#x201d; science. Truth can be found in philosophy, literature, art, music, and history. Truth can be found in the stuff of life that&#x2019;s beyond what is fully measurable or seen. The famous physicist Max Planck expressed a similar sentiment: &#x201c;Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.&#x201d;6</p><p>In other words, fish in a fishbowl.</p><p>Some people will label these further forms of truth the same as faith, but I&#x2019;m not completely comfortable with that term either. Faith is such a loaded word, so personal and charged, so full of various connotations. People talk about taking a blind leap of faith, or stepping out on faith into the great unknown. But that kind of faith is far too limited. The kind of faith I&#x2019;m talking about in this book doesn&#x2019;t ask us to suspend facts. By contrast, it calls us to examine the facts and then build upon them. The faith I&#x2019;m talking about (if we even want to call it faith, but for argument&#x2019;s sake we will) is a faith informed by science, measurability, and logic, not by blindness. This faith asks: What if there were actually very good reasons to believe in the intangible? What is faith? Faith means accepting that there is a greater reality beyond our senses and our intellect. We can use our intellect to instruct us on how we should live our lives, but faith teaches us about the meaning and purpose of our existence. What if there are very good reasons to hold to and live by the veracity of that which cannot be seen?</p><p>As a scientist and as a human being who has grappled with the meaning of faith in my own life and with many patients struggling to comprehend whether life has some deeper significance beyond the here and now, I believe it is possible to develop an appreciation of both the biological and the transcendent, and to explore how each can inform the other in positive ways. There must be a balance.</p><p>We must have science.</p><p>And we must have faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.

With clear lines and carefully toned coloring, the&nbsp;art makes the most of the creepy castle setting, twisting passages, gadgets, and death-defying snowboard escapes, while the mix of perspectives and panel sizes helps to reveal clues in quick succession. Suspense builds right up until the terrifying conclusion, which, because it involves body doubles, has high impact in this visual format, which showcases the mirror effects. A sure hit with both fans and newcomers, particularly reluctant readers.

Earlier musical styles sound different to us today because we hear them through the musical filter of other styles that came after them, all the way through funk and hip hop. <br><br>As its blasphemous title suggests, <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll</em> rejects the conventional pieties of mainstream jazz and rock history. Rather than concentrating on those traditionally favored styles, the book traces the evolution of popular music through developing tastes, trends and technologies--including the role of records, radio, jukeboxes and television --to give a fuller, more balanced account of the broad variety of music that captivated listeners over the course of the twentieth century. Wald revisits original sources--recordings, period articles, memoirs, and interviews--to highlight how music was actually heard and experienced over the years. And in a refreshing departure from more typical histories, he focuses on the world of working musicians and ordinary listeners rather than stars and specialists. He looks for example at the evolution of jazz as dance music, and rock 'n' roll through the eyes of the screaming, twisting teenage girls who made up the bulk of its early audience. Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and the Beatles are all here, but Wald also discusses less familiar names like Paul Whiteman, Guy Lombardo, Mitch Miller, Jo Stafford, Frankie Avalon, and the Shirelles, who in some cases were far more popular than those bright stars we all know today, and who more accurately represent the mainstream of their times. <br><br>Written with verve and style, <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll</em> shakes up our staid notions of music history and helps us hear American popular music with new ears.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elijah Wald</strong> is a musician, writer and historian, whose books include <em>Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues; Narcocorrido</em>, about the modern Mexican ballads of drug trafficking; <em>The Mayor of MacDougal Street</em> (with Dave Van Ronk), and <em>Global Minstrels: Voices of World Music</em>. He is currently teaching at UCLA, and contributing regular pieces to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. For more information, please visit www.elijahwald.com.<br><br>"I couldn't put it down. It nailed me to the wall, not bad for a grand sweeping in-depth exploration of American Music with not one mention of myself. Wald's book is suave, soulful, ebullient and will blow out your speakers."--Tom Waits<p></p><br>"Wald is a meticulous researcher, a graceful writer and a committed contrarian... an impressive accomplishment."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"A complex, fascinating and long-overdue response to decades of industry-driven revisionism."--Jonny Whiteside, <em>LA Weekly</em><p></p><br>"It's an ambitious project, but Wald's casual narrative style and eye for a juicy quote give it a lightness that even a novice to pop, rock, or jazz history can appreciate... The title is appropriate: This is a provocative book, in all the right ways."--<em>The Onion AV Club</em><p></p><br>"Wald is a sharp, fair critic eager to right the record on popular music... deepens the appreciation of American popular music."--<em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"This is a debatable premise... you don't have to agree with it to admire this book... It is as an alternative, corrective history of American music that Wald's book is invaluable. It forces us to see that only by studying the good with the bad--and by seeing that the good and bad can't be pulled apart--can we truly grasp the greatness of our cultural legacy."-- Malcolm Jones, <em>Newsweek</em><p></p><br>"A serious treatise on the history of recorded music, sifted through his filter as musician, scholar, and fan... It's a brave and original work that certainly delivers."-<em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"A smart, inclusive celebration of mainstream stars, such as 1920s bandleader Paul Whiteman and the Fab Four, who introduced jazz, blues, and other roughhewn musical forms to mass audiences."--<em>AARP Magazine</em><p></p><br>"A powerfully provocative look at popular music and its impact on America."--<em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"Elijah Wald is a treasure... There is far too much in these 300 pages to even summarize here. Wald is an economical and lucid writer with an amazing grasp of his subject. I know quite a lot of musical history, and I did not find a single clinker in this symphony of renewal and re-examination."--<em>Winston-Salem Journal</em><p></p><br>"As catchy and compelling as a great pop single, this revisionist retelling is provocative, profound and utterly necessary... Clearly the product of years of passionate research, it's so rife with references and surprising anecdotes that it's potentially overwhelming, but Wald makes a superlative tour guide-- frank, funny and generous but judicious with his inclusions-- and his book is a beguiling, blasphemous breeze."--<em>Philadelphia City Paper</em><p></p><br>"Elijah Wald's provocative, meticulously researched new book, <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music,</em> turns the stock rock-and-roll narratives on their head."--<em>Very Short List</em><p></p><br>"Brilliant and provocative... the most challenging and head-clearing history of American popular music to be published in decades."--<em>The Buffalo News</em><p></p><br>"Wald explains musical and recording techniques and sociological phenomena in an engaging style accessible to a wide range of readers. Throughout, he makes a compelling case for why the figures most historians have disregarded or footnoted need to be considered in order to understand the totality of American popular music. This is an ideal companion to the plethora of standard histories available. Highly recommended." --<em>Library Journal</em> starred review<p></p><br>"Wald's arguments are as nuanced as his scope is wide, which makes this a fascinating and useful volume--required reading for any fan of pop music."--<em>Memphis Flyer</em><p></p><br>"Fascinating... It's hard to imagine any American music buff coming away from this book without a fresh perspective and an overwhelming desire to seek out Paul Whiteman CDs. Highly recommended."--<em>San Jose Mercury News</em><p></p><br>"Wald's book may be the literary equivalent of revisionist Civil War histories which tell the war through the eyes of soldiers rather than the generals, for he highlights how consumers actually heard and experienced music over the years, whether as screaming teeny-boppers watching Dick Clark's Bandstand or swing afficionados dancing to Glenn Miller at the Roseland."--<em>HistoryWire.com</em><p></p><br>"A subtle polemic, one that is fundamentally broad-minded and seeks to educate the reader on the rich legacy and development of American popular music, the music that spawned the Beatles and from which that group departed, for better and worse."--<em>Brooklyn Rail</em><p></p><br>"Walds eminently readable book is a scholarly, provocative and opinionated account of the history of pop music from Sousa to the Stones, from genteel parlor piano recitals to arena rock spectacles."--<em>Kansas City Star</em><p></p><br>"A bracing, inclusive look at the dramatic transformation in the way music was produced and listened to during the 20th century... One of those rare books that aims to upend received wisdom and actually succeeds."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Some of the smartest historiography I've ever read. The examples and turns of phrase sometimes make me laugh out loud, and nearly every page overturns another outmoded assumption. Wald just calls it like he sees it and transforms everything as a result."--Susan McClary, MacArthur Fellow and author of <em>Feminine Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality</em><p></p><br>"This is a ground-breaking book, a muscular revisionist account that will get people thinking quite differently about the history of pop music. I've learned much from it and admire the writing style that is so light on its feet, lucid and elegant."--Bernard Gendron, author of <em>Between Montmartre and</em> <em>the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant Garde</em><p></p><br>"Meticulously researched."--Bookforum.com<p></p><br>"A fascinating and scrupulous piece of pop scholarship...Tantalizing." <em>--Paste Magazine</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Bondage of the Will</h2><p>Martin Luther was one of the most influential men of the last millennium, and the man most responsible for the Reformation that split the Catholic Church in the 16th century. A German theologian, Luther wrote at length criticizing the Church and sparked the Reformation, all while being one of the most read authors on the continent in his lifetime. His teachings included important departures from Church dogma, including the claim that absolution of sin could not be purchased. Today his 99 Theses are among the most famous works in the world. <br><br> The Bondage of the Will is Luther's reply to Erasmus regarding free will, and whether people can choose between good and evil. The argument was crucial to the Reformation and molded the main disagreement over free will vs. predestination.</p><p></p><h2>Death of a Travelling Man (A Hamish Macbeth Mystery, 9)</h2><p><i>From the author of the Agatha Raisin television series...</i><b>DEATH OF A TRAVELING MAN: A Hamish Macbeth Mystery</b>Lochdubh constable Hamish Macbeth's life is going to pot.

You can read more about her work at kelmurphy.com.The click of Ada&#x2019;s door punctuated the end of one sentence and the beginning of another.&nbsp;<br> The first was a sentence from Gran and came at the end of a long tirade. Ada had missed most of it, noting only that it concerned Ada&#x2019;s having set off a bomb in the house, which was mostly but not entirely true. The bomb had not been a real bomb but merely a counterfeit, smoke-producing bomb, which she had to admit was bomblike enough to be convincing, which was rather the point.&nbsp;<br> The counterfeit bomb had done its job and&nbsp;cleared the house of Ada&#x2019;s enemies. Her archnemesis, Nora Radel, had mesmerized an alarming number of the household servants, and they had been advancing menacingly when Ada broke the spell and sent them fleeing with a bit of a bang, a lot of smoke, and a cry of &#x201c;fire!&#x201d;<br> The commotion had also sent Gran running from the house, which had seemed like a bonus at the time. But now Gran was back. And she was not impressed with the way Ada had successfully wrapped up her last case. She was not impressed with the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency. Not impressed with Ada&#x2019;s friends, her room, her dress, her anything . . .&nbsp;<br> The final word of the final sentence of Gran&#x2019;s tirade was &#x201c;precisely.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Precisely?&#x201d; Ada asked, tuning back in, but unclear on what she was meant to be precise about.<br> &#x201c;I shall not repeat myself,&#x201d; Gran said with finality, her snotty pug tucked firmly into her armpit.<br> &#x201c;You probably should,&#x201d; Ada suggested, only realizing how cheeky that sounded after she&#x2019;d said it.<br> And so Gran did. At length. Using words like&nbsp;&#x201c;unsuitable,&#x201d; &#x201c;banished,&#x201d; and &#x201c;forbidden.&#x201d; And Ada still wasn&#x2019;t sure of much except that all the people she had grown to know or love or care about were being brushed away like crumbs from the arm of a chair. And now even Gran herself was gone, not from the house, but from Ada&#x2019;s avalanche of a bedroom.<br> With the clicking of the door, a second sentence had begun. This sentence being a kind of imprisonment to which Ada was to be subjected.<br> Gone&#x2014;no, banished&#x2014;was Ada&#x2019;s dearest friend and co-founder of the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency, Mary Godwin, along with Mary&#x2019;s stepsister, Jane. No word was spoken of Ada&#x2019;s half sister, Allegra, because Gran hadn&#x2019;t known she was even there. But if she had known, Allegra would have been banished too. Along with Peebs, her tutor and ally. Anna, Ada&#x2019;s maid, whose name she had only known for a few months, was also dismissed, despite her many years of service.<br> Ada bundled up the velvet of her gown in little balls in her hot fists and ordered herself not to cry.<br> The results of this attempt were variable.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do we have.&#x201d;<br> It was not a question, and indeed Ada had no one to ask. The not-a-question was spoken aloud in Ada&#x2019;s disastrous bedroom, which contained sliding piles of books and notes and drawings, tools stained with oil, gears, springs, spindles, and several small jam jars full of dirt, which needed to be sorted. Geographically.<br> Ada sighed. What the room did not contain was Mary. If Mary were here, Mary could make sense of everything. Or at least ask the sort of questions that would lead to Ada&#x2019;s making sense of everything, which made Mary happy, which made Ada happy. The lack of Mary resulted in a general unhappiness that clung to the damp room like a chill.<br> The fire had gone out. Of course. Because Anna, tender of fires, was gone.<br> Ada decided she needed options, and time to think. Her room wasn&#x2019;t perfect for this. It didn&#x2019;t have either her bleh&#x2014;her mechanical computer&#x2014;or enough books in it. Taking a look around, Ada&nbsp;admitted that her room probably had the same number of books as the library, but they weren&#x2019;t the right books to solve the problem at hand.<br> Whatever that was, precisely. She hadn&#x2019;t gotten that far yet.<br> The library, then.<br> Ada dared a tiptoe over to her door and turned the knob as silently as she could manage. Peeking out, she spied a footman, stationed just outside her door, preventing any sort of escape&#x2014;even to the library.<br> How to get a footman out of the hallway? Ada had very little experience with such things. She knew her way around her butler, the very tall and entirely silent Mr. Franklin. And she&#x2019;d recently begun to get the hang of maids. The less said about cooks the better, the last one having been under the uncanny influence of a master criminal. It was too much to think about, or at least the wrong time for thinking about it.<br> She sighed, and returned her attention to her escape.<br> What little she had observed about her grandmother&#x2019;s footmen was that they were constantly fetching things, and seemed particularly animated after a door-knocking. But how to knock on the door? The windows of Ada&#x2019;s room looked out the back of the house, so it was not as if she could tie a large wrench to a knotted bedsheet and dangle it out the window, in hopes that a good swing could make contact with the front door. No, she&#x2019;d need to arc the bedsheet straight up and over the roof, hopefully not smashing out any windows in the process.</p><h2>Bryson City Tales: Stories of a Doctor&#39;s First Year of Practice in the Smoky Mountains</h2><p><p>Captivating stories of how a young doctor&#x2019;s first year of medical practice in the Smoky Mountains shaped his practice of life and faith The little mountain hamlet of Bryson City, North Carolina, offers more than dazzling vistas.

And they sure didn&#x2019;t prepare me for this in my family medicine residency. Of course, like all well-trained family physicians, I knew how to provide for the majority of the medical needs of my patients in hospitals and nursing homes. Naturally I had been taught the basics of how to practice medicine in the office setting. But I was quickly discovering that physicians who headed into the rural counties of the Smoky Mountains in the third quarter of the twentieth century needed to know much more than these basics. I don&#x2019;t remember any school or residency lessons on the peculiar calls I would receive from national park rangers telling of a medical emergency in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. &#x201c;Wilderness medicine,&#x201d; at least when I first started practice, was not in my black bag.<br>I don&#x2019;t remember any preparation for the unique medical emergencies faced by the Swain County Rescue Squad. Search-and- rescue medicine wasn&#x2019;t in my repertoire either, nor were the river rescues I would be involved with on the county&#x2019;s four rivers&#x2014;the Tuckasegee, the Nantahala, the Oconaluftee, and the Little Tennessee. And I know for certain that I had no training in caring for animals or livestock&#x2014;but, sure enough, those calls were also to come to a family physician in the Smoky Mountains. Although my formal education had not prepared me for these types of medicine, when the need arose to learn and practice them, I felt up to the challenge. Although I was often perplexed by some of the unique aspects of practicing medicine in a rural&#x2014;and, I first thought, somewhat backward&#x2014;community, I didn&#x2019;t find the demands particularly distressing. My first murder case, however, was a different story.<br>I had just moved a month before, with my wife, Barb, and our nearly-three-year-old daughter, Kate, from my residency in family medicine at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, to Swain County, in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. The county had only 8,000 residents, but occupied over 550 square miles. However, the federal government owned 86 percent of the land&#x2014;and much of it was wilderness. Over 40 percent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is contained within the borders of Swain County, which is also home to the eastern band of the Cherokee Indians, to one of the more southern sections of the Appalachian Trail, and to the beginning of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The doctors in the county seat&#x2014;the small town of Bryson City, North Carolina&#x2014;rotated the on-call assignment. When we were on call, we were responsible for a twenty-four-hour period of time, from 7:00 A.M. to 7:00 A.M. We were on call for all of the patients in Swain County General Hospital&#x2019;s forty beds, the Mountain View Manor Nursing Home, the Bryson City and Swain County jails, and the hospital emergency room. We also provided surgical backup for the physicians in nearby Robbinsville, which had no hospital, and for the physicians at the Cherokee Indian Hospital, located about ten miles away in Cherokee, which had a hospital but no surgeons. While on call, we were also required to serve as the county coroner.<br>Since pathology-trained coroners lived only in the larger towns, the nonpathologist physicians in the rural villages often became certified as coroners. We were not expected to do autopsies&#x2014;only pathologists were trained to perform these&#x2014; but we were expected to provide all of the nonautopsy responsibilities required of a medical examiner.<br>Having obtained my training and certification as a coroner while still in my family medicine residency, I knew the basics of determining the time and cause of death, gathering medical evidence, and filling out the copious triplicate forms from the state. Not sure that I was adequately prepared, but proud to be the holder of a fancy state-provided certificate of competence any-way, I thought I was ready to begin practice in Bryson City&#x2014; ready to join my colleagues as an inexperienced family physician as well as a neophyte medical examiner. It was not long after our arrival that I was required to put my new forensic skills to work. I had finished a fairly busy evening in the emergency room&#x2014; my first night on call in my first week of private practice in this tiny Smoky Mountain town&#x2014;and, after seeing what I thought would be the evening&#x2019;s last patient, I crossed the street to our home, hoping for a quiet night and some much-needed sleep. Sometime between sleep and sunrise, the shrill ring of the phone snatched me from my slumber.<br>&#x201c;Dr. Larimore,&#x201d; barked an official voice. &#x201c;This is Deputy Rogers of the Swain County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department. We&#x2019;re at the site of an apparent homicide and need the coroner up here. I&#x2019;ve been notified that you are the coroner on call. Is that correct, sir?&#x201d; &#x201c;Ten-four,&#x201d; I replied, in my most official coroner-type voice. &#x201c;Then, sir, we need you up at the Watkins place. Stat, sir.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ten-four.&#x201d; Boy, did I ever feel official and important as I placed the phone in its cradle.<br>I rolled over to inform Barb of the advent of my first coroner&#x2019;s case. She didn&#x2019;t even wake up. Nevertheless, I sat upright on the edge of the bed, beginning to feel the adrenaline rush of my first big professional adventure, when I suddenly moaned to myself and fell back into the bed. Where in the world is the Watkins place? I thought to myself. I hadn&#x2019;t a clue. But I knew who would&#x2014;Millie the dispatcher.<br>I hadn&#x2019;t yet met Millie face-to-face, but already I felt I knew her after only a short time in town. Every doctor knew Millie, and she knew everything about every doctor&#x2014;where they would be and what they would be doing at almost any time of any day. Equally important to me was that Millie knew where everyone&#x2019;s &#x201c;place&#x201d; was.<br>So I phoned dispatch. She answered quickly and barked, almost with a snarl, &#x201c;Swain County Dispatch. What you want?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Millie, this is Dr. Larimore.&#x201d;</p><h2>Complete Method for Modern Guitar (Mb93396)</h2><p>All seven volumes of Mel Bay&#39;s original, internationally acclaimed Modern Guitar Method series are included in this single, deluxe master compilation.

Contains hundreds of beginner through advanced solos and duets in all fretboard positions and all keys, plus all four-note rhythm chord formations on high, middle and low sets of adjacent strings. This edition also includes additional outstanding plectrum guitar solo arrangements not found in the original seven volumes. All in all, this outstanding method leads the student to total mastery of the fretboard.</p><p>Mel Bay was born on February 25, 1913 in the little Ozark Mountain town of Bunker, Missouri. He bought a Sears Roebuck guitar at the age of 13 and several months later played his first "gig." (He recalled playing until his fingers were raw!) Mel took up the tenor banjo shortly thereafter and continued to play both instruments. During his teenage years Mel played with a wild assortement of bands and characters in rural Missouri. Perhaps no "gig" was as strange as the job he landed with, in Mel's words, "a snake oil salesman." This flamboyant peddler would pull his ostentatious Pierce Arrow automobile, complete with steer horns mounted on the grill, into the center of a small, rural town. Mel would sit on the car and play up a storm on the tenor banjo. After a crowd gathered, the peddler took over and began extolling the merits of his "wonder elixer." <p>In 1933 Mel Bay moved to St. Louis and began his professional career. He played with numerous local and traveling bands. In addition, he landed staff guitar jobs on several radio stations. Mel fronted his own trio (piano, bass, guitar) and played steadily for 25 years! He was equally adept on most fretted instruments and played mandolin, uke, Hawaiian guitar, tenor and plectrum banjo professionally. </p><p>While Mel was actively pursuing his playing career, he continued to teach as many as 100 students a week. He decided to begin writing instructional materials due to the difficulty encountered by guitarists at playing good sounding chord forms in rhythm sections and due to the poor note reading ability prevalent among guitarists. </p><p>After the war Mel was asked to write instructional materials on guitar for GI's wanting to learn music under the GI Bill. In 1947 Mel formed his own publishing company and wrote his landmark initial book titled The Orchestral Chord System for Guitar. (This book is still in print under the title Rhythm Guitar Chord System and continues to be one the finest rhythm guitar chord texts available!) His Modern Guitar Method was penned shortly thereafter. For years Mel traveled from town to town talking to guitar teachers and players and showing them his publications. At one time Mel claims to have known virtually every guitar teacher in America on a first name basis! The guitar and Mel Bay books caught on in a big way in the 1950's. Things have continued to grow ever since. </p><p>Mel used to sell D'Angelico guitars. At any given time he would have 5 or 6 "lying around the house." Mel played professionally on his New Yorker model but his favorite was the initial Mel Bay Model crafted as a gift for him by John D'Angelico. This famous guitar had all of the main features of the New Yorker but was a "cut away" model and had a slightly thinner neck. This instrument has been pictured on the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method for decades. </p><p>Someone once calculated that sales of guitar books written by Mel Bay have exceeded 25 million copies. When asked, Mel frequently said that he quit counting long ago. Sales of his Modern Guitar Method have alone surpassed the 7 million mark. It is safe to say that Mel Bay is one of the pivotal figures in the world of guitar music and instruction in this century.</p></p><h2>Caste Matters</h2><p>Caste -- the core identity and even a badge of honour for many -- is a matter of daily humiliation and violence for others. As a first-generation Dalit to break out of the stranglehold of poverty and be educated across continents, Suraj Yengde reveals how India&#39;s caste system is disturbingly similar to other forms of oppression -- race, class, gender -- that are unwilling to wither away.

I had plenty of money and no name when I got off the train and even though I had had lunch in the dining car I liked the idea of stopping off for coffee and a doughnut while I decided exactly which way I intended to go, or which way I was intended to go. I do not believe in turning one way or another without consideration, but then neither do I believe that anything is positively necessary at any given time. I got off the train with plenty of money; I needed a name and a place to go; enjoyment and excitement and a fine high gleefulness I knew I could provide on my own.</p><p>A woman said to me in the train station, &#x201c;My sister might want to rent a room to a nice lady; she&#x2019;s got this little crippled kid.&#x201d;</p><p>I could use a little crippled kid, I thought, and so I said, &#x201c;Where does your sister live, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>A fine high gleefulness; I think you understand me; I have everything I want.</p><p>I sold the house at a profit. Once I got Hughie buried&#x2014;my God, he was a lousy painter&#x2014;I only had to make a thousand and three trips back and forth from the barn&#x2014;which was a studio, which was a mess&#x2014;to the house. At my age and size&#x2014;both forty-four, in case it&#x2019;s absolutely vital to know&#x2014;I was carrying those paintings and half-finished canvasses (&#x201c;This is the one the artist was working on the morning of the day he died,&#x201d; and it was just as lousy as all the rest; not even imminent glowing death could help that Hughie) and books and boxes of letters and more than anything else cartons and cartons of things Hughie saved, his old dance programs and marriage licenses and fans and the like. It was none of it anything I ever wanted to see again, I promise you, but I didn&#x2019;t dare throw any of it away for fear Hughie might turn up someday asking, the way they sometimes do, and knowing Hughie it would be the carbon copy of something back in 1946 he wanted. Everything he might ever possibly come around asking for went into the barn; one thousand and three trips back and forth.</p><p>I am not a callous person and no one Hughie ever knew could possibly call me practical, but I had waited long enough. I knew I could sell the house. The furniture went to everyone, and I did think that was funny. They came up to me at the auction, people I had known for years, people who had come to the funeral, people who had sat on the chairs and eaten at the dining-room table and sometimes passed out on the beds, if the truth were known, and they said things like &#x201c;I bought your little maple desk and anytime you want it back it&#x2019;s waiting for you,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Listen, we picked up the silver service, but it&#x2019;s nothing personal,&#x201d; and &#x201c;You know the piano will find a happy home with us,&#x201d; and &#x201c;We are grieving with you today&#x201d;&#x2014;no, that one they said at the funeral. In any case, all the people I had known for years came to the auction and the ones who had the nerve came up and spoke to me, sometimes embarrassed because here they were peeking at the undersprings of my sofa, and sometimes just plain brazen because they had gotten something of mine they wanted. I heard one woman&#x2014;no names, of course; no one has a name yet&#x2014;saying to another woman that the dining-room breakfront had always been wasted on me, which was true; I only kept it at all because I was afraid my dead grandmother would come around asking. Actually, almost all of it was wasted on me. It was Hughie&#x2019;s idea. &#x201c;You come of such a nice family,&#x201d; he used to say to me, &#x201c;your people were all such cultivated educated people; try to remember.&#x201d;</p><p>So that was how I started out. I&#x2019;d thought about it for a long time of course&#x2014;not that I positively expected I was going to have to bury Hughie, but he had a good life&#x2014;and everything went the way I used to figure it would. I sold the house, I auctioned off the furniture, I put all the paintings and boxes in the barn, I erased my old name and took my initials off everything, and I got on the train and left.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t say I actually chose the city I was going to; it was actually and truly the only one available at the moment; I hadn&#x2019;t ever been there and it seemed a good size and I had enough in my pocket to pay the fare. When I got off the train I took a deep breath of the dirty city air and carried my suitcase and my pocketbook and my fur stole&#x2014;Hughie wasn&#x2019;t selfish, I don&#x2019;t want to give a wrong impression; I always had everything I wanted&#x2014;and stopped at the counter for coffee and doughnuts.</p><p>&#x201c;My sister might want to rent a room to a nice lady,&#x201d; this woman said to me, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s got this little crippled kid.&#x201d;</p><p>So I said, &#x201c;Where does your sister live, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>That was where I got my first direction, you see. Smith Street. Where I was going to be living for a while.</p><p>The city is a pretty city, particularly after living in the country; I have nothing actually against trees and grass, of course, but Hughie always wanted to live in the country. There was a zoo somewhere in this city, and a college, and a few big stores, and streetcars, which I believe you don&#x2019;t often see any more. I knew there was an art gallery&#x2014;who could be married to Hughie, that painter, and not know about an art gallery?&#x2014;and a symphony orchestra, and surely a little theater group, mostly wives and fairies; if I liked the city and I stayed I might look up the little theater group; there was an art movie and I hoped at least one good restaurant; I am a first-rate cook.</p><p>More than anything else, more than art movies or zoos, I wanted to talk to people; I was starved for strangers. I began with the woman at the counter in the railroad station.</p><p>&#x201c;She has this little crippled kid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where does your sister live, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was married to the same man for twenty-seven years and all he left her was the house and this little kid, he&#x2019;s crippled. Me, I don&#x2019;t like a man like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t leave you with much, and that&#x2019;s a fact.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After twenty-seven years married to the same man she shouldn&#x2019;t have to take in roomers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But if one of her roomers turns out to be me it might all have been worthwhile.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;ve been, visiting my sister.&#x201d; She put down her coffee cup. &#x201c;I come to visit her. And then I take the train back home. You have to take the train to get from my house to hers.&#x201d; She looked at me carefully, as though she might be wondering whether I could remember my own name. &#x201c;She lives on Smith Street. You&#x2019;ll know the house. It&#x2019;s big. She&#x2019;s got this sign ROOMS.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least he left her a big house,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Up and down stairs all the time, keeping up a big house these days. She&#x2019;s not getting any younger, and the kid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re none of us,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>After that I talked to a man on a corner; he was waiting for a streetcar. &#x201c;Does this streetcar go to Smith Street?&#x201d; I asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;What streetcar?&#x201d; He turned and looked down the street.</p><p>&#x201c;The one you&#x2019;re waiting for; this is a car stop, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked again, and we marveled together at the delights of the city, where you could stand on a corner and a streetcar would come. &#x201c;Where you say?&#x201d; he asked me.</p><p>&#x201c;Smith Street.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You live there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I got this little crippled kid. Big house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you get that car across the street. Because across the street is going the other way. How long you say you&#x2019;ve lived there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-seven years. With the same man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He any better at catching streetcars than you are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a motorman,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I try to avoid his route.&#x201d;</p><p>This clearly sounded right to him. &#x201c;Women always checking up,&#x201d; he said, and turned away from me.</p><p>Then I talked to an old lady in a bookshop, who was so very tired that she leaned her elbows on piles of books as we talked; she told me that the city was hell on books, because of the college, and they stole a thousand paperbacks a year. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t seem to think of them as books,&#x201d; she said, furious, &#x201c;books they don&#x2019;t dare steal because of the covers. Also they know I&#x2019;m watching.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you sell a lot of books?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the college,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They come here to get an education.&#x201d; She laughed, furious. &#x201c;No one speaks English any more,&#x201d; she said. She took her elbows off the pile of books and went back to sit down on a dirty old chair in the back of the store. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m watching,&#x201d; she called out, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still watching,&#x201d; but I was leaving.</p><p>I went to the correct side of the street and put my suitcase down and waited carrying my pocketbook and my fur stole until a streetcar came by reading SMITH STREET and I decided well this is certainly the streetcar they meant when they said it went to Smith Street. I swung my suitcase on and climbed up behind it; you know, <i>they</i> know old ladies&#x2014;not me&#x2014;and little crippled kids and pregnant women and maybe sick people with broken arms are all going to have to ride on those streetcars; you&#x2019;d think they didn&#x2019;t want passengers, the way they make those steps. I suppose the salary they pay the motorman he wouldn&#x2019;t help anyone anyway. He looked at me; he was sitting down driving his streetcar and I was climbing on with my suitcase and my pocketbook and my fur stole, and I figured if he wasn&#x2019;t going to help me I wasn&#x2019;t going to help him, so I said, &#x201c;Does this streetcar go to Smith Street?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at me; I must say I like it better when they look at you; a lot of the time people seem to be scared of finding out that other people have real faces, as though if you looked at a stranger clearly and honestly and with both eyes you might find yourself learning something you didn&#x2019;t actually want to know. &#x201c;Lady,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I promise you. This streetcar goes to Smith Street every trip. That&#x2019;s why,&#x201d; he said, and he was not smiling, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s why it says so on the front.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; I was not smiling either and he knew he had met someone as stubborn as he was, so he quit.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, lady,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost positive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. It never pays to let a minute like that slip by; every word counts. I might never see that motorman again, but on the other hand, I might be living on Smith Street and ride home with him every night. He might get to calling me by whatever name I finally picked out and I might take to asking him every night how his wife&#x2019;s asthma was today and did his daughter break up with that guy who stole the money and I might take to asking him every night, &#x201c;Say, driver, does this streetcar go to Smith Street?&#x201d;</p><p>And he might say, every night, not smiling, &#x201c;Yes, lady, it surely does.&#x201d;</p><p>Hughie would not have thought any of that was funny. In case he ever does come back asking I will certainly remember not to tell him.</p><p>There is a kind of controlled madness to streetcars; they swing along as though they haven&#x2019;t quite come to terms with tracks yet, and haven&#x2019;t really decided whether tracks are here to stay or streetcars are here to stay on tracks; they swing and tilt and knock people around, especially people who are trying to hold onto a suitcase and a pocketbook and a fur stole. I sat there sliding around on the seat and wondering if anyone was laughing at me and wondering if maybe I was the streetcar type after all, and outside the window the city went by. I saw the biggest store in town and thought that someday very soon I would be in there, and I might say, &#x201c;Well, if you haven&#x2019;t got this blouse in a size forty-four I&#x2019;ll just run across the street and try there.&#x201d; I would have to have a name before I could open any charge accounts anywhere. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather you didn&#x2019;t carry money,&#x201d; Hughie used to say, &#x201c;I want you to go into a store and pick out what you want and tell them your name and walk out; I don&#x2019;t care if it&#x2019;s a thousand dollars, just tell them your name and take what you want.&#x201d; There were hotels; I might come back for a visit someday, and see all my old friends on Smith Street; I might go tea-dancing at the Splendid Hotel, although one letter was missing from its marquee; I might drop into the lobby of the Royal Hotel to hear who was being paged, and pick up a name that way. I saw a drugstore where I might get a prescription filled and buy shampoo, I saw a shop where I might buy records and a place to get my shoes repaired and a laundry and a candy store and a grocery and a leather shop and a pet shop and a toy store. It was a proper little city, correct and complete, set up exactly for my private use, fitted out with quite the right people, waiting for me to come. I slid around on the streetcar seat and thought that they had done it all very well.</p><p>I must say that motorman got the last word. I was still looking out the window when he turned around and yelled, &#x201c;Smith Street.&#x201d; In case there was any doubt about who he was yelling at he pointed his finger at me.</p><p>&#x201c;How is your wife&#x2019;s asthma?&#x201d; I asked him when I came down the aisle with my suitcase and my pocketbook and my fur stole.</p><p>&#x201c;Better, thank you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Watch your step.&#x201d;</p><p>It was Smith Street all right; no one had lied to me yet. They wanted to make sure I got there as planned; there was a sign on the corner saying SMITH STREET.</p><p>I was glad to see that there were trees; far down, at the end, I could see what looked like a little park, and on either side of Smith Street going down to the park there were trees. I thought I would enjoy coming home under the trees, in the rain, perhaps, or in the fall when the leaves were dropping. I thought I would enjoy hearing the sound of the leaves brushing against my window. The houses were the kind no one has built for a good twenty-seven years, big and ample and made for people who liked to sit on their own front porches and watch their neighbors. There were lawns and bushes and garden hoses, there were dogs. The house I wanted was on my right, about halfway down the block; it was a big house with a sign saying ROOMS although I didn&#x2019;t see any little kids looking crippled. I stood across the street from the house for a few minutes; here I am, I thought, here I am.</p><p>No one, anywhere, anytime, had given me any word of any other place to go. This was the only objective I had; if I didn&#x2019;t go in here they wouldn&#x2019;t tell me any other place to go. I wondered which room was going to be mine and whether I would look down from its window onto the street and see myself standing there looking up and waiting; by the time I looked out of the window I would have to have a name.</p><p>Right then I wished I could sit down for a minute and maybe have a little something to eat; nothing looks sillier than a forty-four-year-old woman standing on a sidewalk with a suitcase and a pocketbook and a fur stole trying to think up a name for herself. Somewhere down the street someone called a dog, calling &#x201c;Here, Rover,&#x201d; and I thought that Rover was probably a good name but it was not actually exactly what I was looking for; I thought I might stop someone going by and ask for their name but no one wants to give away a name that might be terribly important to keep, and even if they did tell it to me I might not be able to spell it or even pronounce it right and if you&#x2019;ve got a name at all you&#x2019;ve got to be able to say it out loud. I thought of Laura, but Laura was my mother&#x2019;s name. I didn&#x2019;t want any more of Hughie and his names, and Bertha was my grandmother and who wants to be named Bertha, particularly after her grandmother? I thought of Muriel but that just sounds like someone who get...</p></p><h2>All Hearts Come Home For Christmas</h2><p><p><b>Christmas at Falstone Castle by Sarah M.

Inspector Cramer, with no appointment, showed up a little before noon at Nero Wolfe&#x2019;s old brownstone on West Thirty-fifth Street and, after I had ushered him into the office and he had exchanged greetings with Wolfe and lowered himself into the red leather chair, he said right out, &#x201c;I dropped in to ask a little favor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> What was remarkable was his admitting it. From my chair at my desk I made an appropriate noise. He sent me a sharp glance and asked if I had something.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; I told him courteously, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right on top. You just jolted that out of me. So many times I&#x2019;ve seen you come here for a favor and try to bull it or twist it, it was quite a shock.&#x201d; I waved it away tolerantly. &#x201c;Skip it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His face, chronically red, deepened a shade. His broad shoulders stiffened, and the creases spreading from the corners of his gray-blue eyes showed more as the eyelids tightened. Then, deciding I was playing for a blurt, he controlled it. &#x201c;Do you know,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;whose opinion of you I would like to have? Darwin&#x2019;s. Where were you while evolution was going on?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stop brawling,&#x201d; Wolfe muttered at us from behind his desk. He was testy, not because he would have minded seeing either Cramer or me draw blood, but because he always resented being interrupted in the middle of a London Times crossword puzzle. He frowned at Cramer. &#x201c;What favor, sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing strenuous.&#x201d; Cramer relaxed. &#x201c;A little point about a homicide. A man&#x2019;s body fished out of the East River a week ago yesterday, off Ninetieth Street. He had been&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Named Leonard Dykes,&#x201d; Wolfe said brusquely, wanting to make it brief so he could finish the puzzle before lunch. &#x201c;Confidential clerk in a law office, around forty, had been in the water perhaps two days. Evidence of a severe blow on the head, but had died of drowning. No one charged by last evening. I read all the homicide news.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I bet you do.&#x201d; That having slipped out by force of habit, Cramer decided it wasn&#x2019;t tactful and smiled it off. He could smile when he wanted to. &#x201c;Not only is no one charged, we haven&#x2019;t got a smell. We&#x2019;ve done everything, you know what we&#x2019;ve done, and we&#x2019;re stopped. He lived alone in a room-and-bath walk-up on Sullivan Street. By the time we got there it had been combed&#x2014;not torn apart, but someone had been through it good. We didn&#x2019;t find anything that&#x2019;s been any help, but we found one thing that might possibly help if we could figure it out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He got papers from his breast pocket, from them selected an envelope, and from the envelope took a folded sheet of paper. &#x201c;This was inside a book, a novel. I can give you the name of the book and the numbers of the pages it was found between, but I don&#x2019;t think that has a bearing.&#x201d; He got up to hand the paper to Wolfe. &#x201c;Take a look at it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe ran his eyes over it, and, since I was supposed to be up on everything that went on in that office so as to be eligible for blame if and when required, I arose and extended a hand. He passed it over.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in Dykes&#x2019;s handwriting,&#x201d; Cramer said. &#x201c;The paper is a sheet from a scratch pad there on a table in his room. There were more pads like it in a drawer of the table.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was giving it a look. The paper was white, ordinary, six by nine, and at the top was the word &#x201c;Tentative,&#x201d; underscored, written with pencil in a neat almost perpendicular hand. Below it was a list of names:<br> &nbsp;<br> Sinclair Meade<br> Sinclair Sampson<br> Barry Bowen<br> David Yerkes<br> Ernest Vinson<br> Dorian Vick<br> Baird Archer<br> Oscar Shiff<br> Oscar Cody<br> Lawrence McCue<br> Mark McCue<br> Mark Flick<br> Mack Flick<br> Louis Gill<br> Lewis Gill<br> &nbsp;<br> I handed it back to Cramer and returned to my chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Wolfe asked impatiently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was on my way uptown and dropped in to show it to you.&#x201d; Cramer folded the sheet and put it in the envelope. &#x201c;Not so much to get help, it probably has nothing to do with the homicide, but it&#x2019;s got me irritated and I wondered what you&#x2019;d say, so I dropped in. A list of fifteen names written by Dykes on a piece of his scratch paper, and not one of them can be found in any phone directory in the metropolitan area! Or anywhere else. We can find no record anywhere of a man with any of those names. None of Dykes&#x2019;s friends or associates ever heard of a man with one of those names, so they say. I mean, taking the first and last names together, as they are on that list. Of course we haven&#x2019;t checked the whole damn country, but Dykes was a born and bred New Yorker, with no particular connections elsewhere that we know of. What the hell kind of a list of names is that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe grunted. &#x201c;He made them up. He was considering an alias, for himself or someone else.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We thought of that, naturally. If so, no one ever used it that we can find.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Keep trying if you think it&#x2019;s worth it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah. But we&#x2019;re only human. I just thought I&#x2019;d show it to a genius and see what happened. With a genius you never know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Nothing has happened.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, by God, I hope you&#x2019;ll excuse me&#x201d;&#x2014;Cramer got up. He was sore, and you couldn&#x2019;t blame him&#x2014;&#x201c;for taking up your time and no fee. Don&#x2019;t bother, Goodwin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned and marched out. Wolfe bent over his crossword puzzle, frowned at it, and picked up his pencil.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Own the Wind: A Chaos Novel</h2><p><b>Meet the intense and sexy bad boy bikers of the Chaos Motorcycle Club in Tabby and Shy's story from Kristen Ashley's <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b> <b><b><br></b>Too hot to handle . . . </b><br><br>Tabitha Allen grew up in the thick of Chaos-the Chaos Motorcycle Club, that is.

A boy named Link sets out on a quest to deliver the Emerald, the spiritual stone of the forest, to Zelda, Princess of the land of Hyrule. The journey will be long and perilous, and Link will need all his skill and courage to defeat evil. The battle for Hyrule and the Sacred Realm has begun!</p><p>Akira Himekawa is the collaboration of two women, A. Honda and S. Nagano. Together they have created ten manga adventures featuring Link and the popular video game world of The Legend of Zelda, including Ocarina of Time, Oracle of Seasons, and Four Swords. Their most recent work, Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, is serialized in Shogaku RokunenseiGrade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;As the young adventurer Link is traveling the seas, his captain and friend, Tetra, discovers a ghost ship and is spirited away. Link therefore joins forces with the avaricious Captain Linebeck and Ciela, a fairy spirit, to save her and defeat the malicious ocean monster Bellum. In this manga, the essential structure strives to capture some of the absurdist puzzle structures featured in the original Nintendo DS game, alternating quickly between various short trials and challenges and Link and Linebeck's banter. This culminates in a hilariously unbelievable battle where the ultimate magic weapon&#x2014;that Link can't win without&#x2014;is being forged even as Link battles the final boss. Drawn in an overtly comedic style, the book nevertheless presents the rakish cowardice of Linebeck in a sufficiently charming manner, and the final plot twists contain ample pathos to move unjaded readers. But mostly the book is content to coast on fine draftsmanship and whimsy. It's a sure-handed presentation of a guileless children's narrative, utterly lacking in subtlety, but long on a certain innocent charisma. Critical eyes may be irritated or interested in how it deviates from the game's original story line.&#x2014;<i>Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2011. &nbsp;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

In this book, an eminent Jungian analyst examines the recurring motifs that appear in creation myths from around the world and shows what they teach us about the mysteries of creativity, the cycles of renewal in human life, and the birth of consciousness in the individual psyche. Among the topics discussed are: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Why the creative process is often accompanied by anxiety, depression, loneliness, and fear of the unknown. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The meaning of creation motifs such as the egg, the seed, the primordial being, the creative fire, the separation of heaven and earth, and the four stages of creation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Creation symbolism in the alchemical opus of medieval tradition. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; How creation-myth motifs appear in the dreams of people who are on the verge of a leap forward in consciousness.</p><p>Marie-Louise von Franz (1915&#x2013;1998) was the foremost student of C. G. Jung, with whom she worked closely from 1934 until his death in 1961. A founder of the C. G. Jung Institute of Zurich, she published widely on subjects including alchemy, dreams, fairy tales, personality types, and psychotherapy."This is a book all should read. In doing so, one will expand the mind to different levels of thought and in relationship to our contemporary life in such an interesting and scholarly fashion."&#x2014; <i>Spiritual Frontiers </i><br>"[Von Franz] ranges authoritatively over the myths of many cultures and succeeds in explaining widespread archetypal images that inform the collective unconscious and contribute to our ability to create as individual human beings."&#x2014; <i>Parabola</i></p><h2>Astrology of the Moon: An Illuminating Journey Through the Signs and Houses</h2><p><p>Your moon sign represents your emotional nature and lights the way toward profound spiritual growth.

As a revolution sweeps through Paris, can Valjean elude Javert and secure a happy life for Cosette before all is lost? Follow their story in Marcia Williams&#x2019;s entertaining and easily digestible retelling for young readers.</p><p><b>Marcia Williams</b> has written and illustrated many books and retold a number of classics in her warm, accessible comic-strip style. She lives in London.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Williams introduces the characters and plot of Hugo's classic novel in 15 short chapters presented in comic strip format with brief narrative text placed beneath each cartoon illustration. Characters' own comments appear in speech balloons within the cartoon frames. This is the story of Jean Valjean, who leaves prison a bitter man after having served 19 years of hard labor for stealing a loaf of bread; Valjean's honorable treatment by the Bishop of Digne after he steals the man's silverware; his remorse after taking a young boy's only coin; and his decision to spend his life helping others. Readers familiar with the classic story will recognize his later appearance in the city of Montreuil as a kind and successful businessman who hires honest, hardworking people. Valjean makes a promise to the dying Fantine to care for her young daughter, Cosette, endearing him to the people who appoint him their mayor. Only the single-minded Inspector Javert is convinced that Valjean continues to break the law. Williams's talent for telling a story in cartoon format is evidenced by the variety in her page layouts, which range in size from tiny squares to quarter-, third-, and full-page cartoons filled with movement, emotion, and fine detail. Small gray, brown, and black birds; dogs with pointy muzzles; fluffy orange, gray and black cats; roosters; and an abundance of rats appear in and around many cartoon cells. Good people are drawn with rounded, often cute, faces; evil people, like the Th�nardiers, with long, pointy noses and shifty eyes.

The story begins in 1973, in the offices of <i>The Atlantic Monthly,</i> in Boston, where a young freelance writer named Tracy Kidder came looking for an assignment. Richard Todd was the editor who encouraged him. From that article grew a lifelong association. Before long, Kidder&#x2019;s <i>The Soul of a New Machine,</i> the first book the two worked on together, had won the Pulitzer Prize. It was a heady moment, but for Kidder and Todd it was only the beginning of an education in the art of nonfiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Good Prose </i>explores three major nonfiction forms: narratives, essays, and memoirs. Kidder and Todd draw candidly, sometimes comically, on their own experience&#x2014;their mistakes as well as accomplishments&#x2014;to demonstrate the pragmatic ways in which creative problems get solved. They also turn to the works of a wide range of writers, novelists as well as nonfiction writers, for models and instruction. They talk about narrative strategies (and about how to find a story, sometimes in surprising places), about the ethical challenges of nonfiction, and about the realities of making a living as a writer. They offer some tart and emphatic opinions on the current state of language. And they take a clear stand against playing loose with the facts. Their advice is always grounded in the practical world of writing and publishing.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Good Prose</i>&#x2014;like Strunk and White&#x2019;s <i>The Elements of Style&#x2014;</i>is a succinct, authoritative, and entertaining arbiter of standards in contemporary writing, offering guidance for the professional writer and the beginner alike.

Neither of us can remember the date, but it must have been around the<br>time our fi rst joint effort as writer and editor was published, in July 1973.<br><br>By then The Atlantic was 117 years old. You sensed lineage when you walked up to its headquarters, an old brownstone on<br>the corner of Arlington and Marlborough streets, facing the Public Garden. It was prime real estate, but it was also in Boston,<br>not New York or Los Angeles. This was a magazine headquarters that seemed to say it was untouched by commerce, like<br>the wealthy Boston matron who, in an old joke, says, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t buy our hats, we have our hats.&#x201d; A boiler room clamor faintly<br>tolled in the offi ces upstairs, which had achieved High Shabbiness: faded mementos on the walls, layers of discolored paint on<br>the ornate moldings, threadbare carpeting. The building once, in the era of Silas Lapham, had been a single-family mansion,<br>and much of the fl oor plan had survived&#x2014;many small rooms in back, in what must have been the servants&#x2019; quarters, and in front,<br>offi ces with fi replaces that editors used now and then when the Boston winter outperformed the heating plant.<br><br>It was an era that in memory seems closer to The Atlantic&#x2019;s distant past than to our present, an era of typewriters and<br>secretaries&#x2014;mostly young, wry women with fi rst-class educations trying to find their way into publishing careers. There<br>were a few older women, two of them editors; one wore a hat at her desk. The women of both ranks kept regular hours. The men<br>arrived midmorning and not long afterward went to lunch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to grab a sandwich,&#x201d; the editor-in-chief, Bob Manning,<br>would tell his assistant, as he headed for the all-male sanctuary and full luncheon menu of the Tavern Club. The more junior<br>men stepped out soon afterward, and often ended up at the Ritz Bar, a block away on Arlington Street. An editor with a writer<br>in tow could charge his lunch to the magazine. Eggs Benedict, a couple of small carafes of white wine, and back to work, rarely<br>later than two thirty. Many afternoons were cheery.<br><br>The Atlantic was more or less broke by then, just barely paying its expenses and about to become an exercise in cultural defi cit<br>spending for its owner. Editors didn&#x2019;t earn much, less than twenty thousand a year (which bought more then than now, of<br>course, in part because there weren&#x2019;t as many things to buy). A young writer was paid by the piece, two or three thousand dollars<br>at most for a long article that might take four months to complete.<br><br>The Atlantic&#x2019;s archives held a trove of articles and stories and poems by just about every major American writer of the late<br>nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The magazine was still one of America&#x2019;s preeminent cultural arbiters, but the role<br>was increasingly hard to play. In politics, The Atlantic had long stood for liberal thought. Now its editors stared out their windows<br>onto a world in which liberalism was under attack from both sides, from the Weathermen as well as the Nixon White<br>House. Every month the staff argued over the magazine&#x2019;s cover and usually ended up with something colorful and overstated, in<br>the vain hope that a touch of sensation would improve newsstand sales. But the covers threatened the magazine&#x2019;s cultural<br>legitimacy, the real attraction for its true audience and for many who worked there.<br><br>Nearly forty years is long enough to make the &#x201c;us&#x201d; of back then feel like &#x201c;they.&#x201d; We were young&#x2014;Kidder twenty-seven,<br>Todd thirty-two&#x2014;and each of us was trying to stake out a literary future. To Todd, editing at The Atlantic granted prestige,<br>like owning a fine antique. If he&#x2019;d been in charge, the magazine would have reverted to the monochrome covers of its heyday.<br>As for Kidder, the idea of publishing articles at The Atlantic was more than exciting enough, since he would have been grateful<br>to be published anywhere. Phone calls were expensive back then and allowances for research miserly. For a young writer<br>short of funds, it was convenient to spend time in the building, camping out as it were in one of its many vacant back offi ces and<br>using the magazine&#x2019;s phones for long-distance calls to sources for articles. Kidder spent many days and quite a few nights in the<br>building, and many hours working with Todd, whose office had a fi replace and a view. After-hours provisions could be found in<br>the bar in Manning&#x2019;s offi ce down the hall.<br><br>We called each other by our surnames, as our sergeants had in army basic training. To Kidder, a childhood for Todd seemed<br>improbable&#x2014;he must have been born old, and probably born ironic to boot. To Todd, and practically everyone else, Kidder<br>was young beyond his years. He was plainly ambitious, but his self-esteem ranged from abject to grandiose. Once, at a Christmas<br>party that went on too long, he confronted Bob Manning and announced, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the best damn journalist in the Western<br>Hemisphere.&#x201d; Hung over and contrite the next morning, he was comforted by Todd, who said, &#x201c;At least you didn&#x2019;t claim the<br>whole world.&#x201d; Each imagined himself forbearing of the other.<br><br>Kidder wrote and rewrote many versions of his first Atlantic article, about a mass murder case in California. He had imagined<br>the piece as a sequel to In Cold Blood. At some point Bob Manning sent the manuscript back to Todd, having scrawled on it,<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s face it, this fellow can&#x2019;t write.&#x201d; Todd kept this comment to himself and merely told Kidder that the piece still needed fixing,<br>and the rewriting continued.<br><br>A long association had begun. Todd knew only that he had a writer of boundless energy. For Kidder, to be allowed not just to<br>rewrite but to rewrite ad infi nitum was a privilege, preferable in every way to rejection slips. And for Todd, it was possible to<br>imagine that a writer willing to rewrite might turn out to be useful. Todd once remarked to a group of students, never expecting<br>he would be quoted, &#x201c;Kidder&#x2019;s great strength is that he&#x2019;s not afraid of writing badly.&#x201d; The truth was that Kidder was afraid of<br>writing badly in public, but not in front of Todd. Kidder would give him pieces of unfi nished drafts. He would even read Todd<br>passages of unfi nished drafts, uninvited, over the phone. Very soon Todd understood when he was being asked for reassurance,<br>not criticism, and would say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fi ne. Keep going.&#x201d; When a draft was done, Todd would point out &#x201c;some problems,&#x201d; and another<br>rewrite would begin.<br><br>That ritual established itself early on and persisted through many articles and Kidder&#x2019;s fi rst two books. A time came&#x2014;<br>midway through the writing of Among Schoolchildren, about a fifth-grade teacher&#x2014;when Kidder began revising pages before<br>Todd had a chance to read them. This was a means of delaying criticism forever. No doubt that was Kidder&#x2019;s goal, and he could<br>remain happily unaware of it as long as he kept on rewriting. Things went on that way for a while, until Todd said, in the<br>most serious tone he could muster, &#x201c;Kidder, if you rewrite this book again before I have time to read it, I&#x2019;m not working on it<br>anymore.&#x201d; Kidder restrained himself, and the former routine was reestablished.<br><br>Eventually The Atlantic changed hands. Its book publishing arm was sold off, its headquarters relocated, its old building renovated<br>into a corporate offi ce. We lingered for a time, working under a new head editor, William Whitworth, who was to both<br>of us exemplary. He once told Kidder, &#x201c;Every writer needs another set of eyes.&#x201d; When Todd moved on to do his own writing<br>and to edit books, Kidder followed him.<br><br>This book is in part an account of lessons learned, learned by a writer and an editor working together over nearly forty years.<br>Good Prose is addressed to readers and writers, to people who care about writing, about how it gets done, about how to do it<br>better. That you can learn to write better is one of our fundamental assumptions. No sensible person would deny the mystery<br>of talent, or for that matter the mystery of inspiration. But if it is vain to deny these mysteries, it is useless to depend on them. No<br>other art form is so infi nitely mutable. Writing is revision. All prose responds to work.&nbsp; <br><br>We should acknowledge some other predispositions. We&#x2019;re<br>sticklers on fact. Nonfiction means much more than accuracy, but it begins with not making things up. If it happened on Tuesday,<br>that&#x2019;s when it happened, even if Thursday would make for a tidier story. (And in our experience, at least, Tuesday usually<br>turns out to make for a more interesting story.) This is not to confuse facts with the truth, a subject we will deal with.<br><br>We also believe in the power of story and character. We think that the techniques of fi ction never belonged exclusively to fi ction,<br>and that no techniques of storytelling are prohibited to the nonfiction writer, only the attempt to pass off inventions as facts.<br>We think that the obscure person or setting can be a legitimate subject for the serious nonfi ction writer. And we think that every<br>piece of writing&#x2014;whether story or argument or rumination, book or essay or letter home&#x2014;requires the freshness and precision<br>that convey a distinct human presence.<br><br>During the past three decades American culture has become louder, faster, more disjointed. For immediacy of effect, writers<br>can&#x2019;t compete with popular music or action movies, cable network news or the multiplying forms of instant messaging. We<br>think that writers shouldn&#x2019;t try, that there is no need to try. Writing remains the best route we know toward clarity of<br>thought and feeling. Good Prose is mainly a practical book, the product of years of experiment in three types of prose: writing about the world,<br>writing about ideas, and writing about the self. To put this another way, this book is a product of our attempts to write and to<br>edit narratives, essays, and memoirs.

Dreaded by his enemies, emulated by later rulers like Ivan the Terrible, honored by his countrymen even today, Vlad Dracula was surely one of the most intriguing figures to have stalked the corridors of European and Asian capitals in the fifteenth century.</p><p>Radu R. Florescu and Raymond T. McNally are the authors of the international bestseller, IN SEARCH OF DRACULA and have long been recognised as the leading experts on Dracula and Eastern European history and folklore. Raymond T. McNallyDracula is the third book that Florescu and McNally, both historians at Boston College, have written about either the real Dracula or the legendary vampire ( Dracula: A Historical Biography of the Impaler, 1431-1476 , Hawthorn, 1973; LJ 2/1/74). This scholarly work focuses almost exclusively upon the "real" Dracula, a 15th-century Romanian prince. The authors present him as a multifaceted figure, a national hero still revered for defending Romania from the Turks, yet also a psychopath who used his power indiscriminately to torture and murder thousands of his enemies and subjects. Because of the constant interest in the occult (especially in the vampire Dracula), public libraries will want this for popular collections. Because of its sound treatment of an important figure in Eastern European history, academic libraries also should consider.<br><i>- Ann H. Sullivan, Tompkins Cortland Community Coll.

George combines clear, intelligent, and functional advice on fiction writing with anecdotes from her own life, the story of her journey to publication, and inside information on how she meticulously researches and writes her novels. George's solid understanding of craft is conveyed in the enticing manner of a true storyteller, making <b>Write Away</b> not only a marvelous, interesting, and informative book but also a glimpse inside the world of a beloved writer.</p></p><p><p>Elizabeth George is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of sixteen novels of psychological suspense, one book of nonfiction, and two short story collections. Her work has been honored with the Anthony and Agatha awards, the Grand Prix de Litt�rature Polici�re, and the MIMI, Germany's prestigious prize for suspense fiction. She lives in Washington State.</p>Here's a useful book for the novice writer battling the fears and insecurities that attend when she contemplates her first novel. Highly successful as the writer of a dozen novels of suspense (A Place of Hiding, etc.) and a teacher with significant experience, George reveals that those same fears and insecurities still bedevil her. She quickly moves beyond that to a consideration of the craft of writing-mastering the tools and techniques that a writer needs in order to create art. While George illustrates her points with passages from both her own works and those of numerous writers she admires (Martin Cruz Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Louise Erdrich, Michael Dorris), this remains more of a how-I-do-it book than a how-to-do-it book. Thus George will typically discuss an aspect of writing, such as creating the landscape of a novel, illustrate it with examples from various writers and then show how she approaches it. The result is an informative, instructive and idiosyncratic examination of the structure of the novel and of one writer's rigorously disciplined approach to creating one. George makes clear that writing is a job and that mastering the tools and techniques of the craft can go a long way toward making a writer successful. Finally, she advocates self-discipline, or what Bryce Courtenay (The Power of One) calls "bum glue." As George puts it, "A lot of writing is simply showing up... day after day, same time and same place." Both aspiring writers and fans of George's novels should enjoy the author's insights into the creative process. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His business manufactured cameras and photography equipment under the Leica brand. He sent Jewish employees abroad to safer places. Besides the employees themselves, Leitz helped their families and some of his Jewish neighbors and business associates flee by moving overseas. Jewish employees received training and permits that allowed them to travel abroad as sales agents for Leica products. Leitz organized and paid for their transit England, USA, Brazil, and Hong Kong. He gave them a Leica camera, which could easily be sold. Leitz paid their expenses until they could find employment in their new home. Many found work in the photo industry. Leitz did not speak of this but his son, G�nther, tried to write an article about the refugees. Leitz did not want to share his story. Perhaps he felt it would be boasting. He believed he had done what any decent person would do in his position. G�nther later said, &#x201c;No one can ever know what other Germans had done for the persecuted within the limits of their ability to act.&#x201d; Like Oskar Schindler, Leitz was a member of the Nazi party. Many prominent people joined the party not because they agreed with Nazi policies, but because doing so allowed them to be left alone. They could continue running their businesses &#x201c;under the radar&#x201d; of Nazi scrutiny. Also, the Nazis&#x2019; dependence on the military optics produced by Leica, made his company valuable to them. Leitz&#x2019;s heroism came to light many years later, when Rabbi Frank Dabba Smith of London, then still a student, saw Leitz refugees mentioned in a photography magazine. One of these refugees was Kurt Rosenberg, a camera mechanic. Leitz helped him get a visa to America, paid for his journey to New York in 1938, and got him a job at the Leica showroom on Fifth Avenue. Ernst Leitz&#x2019;s aid to his Jewish associates came from the heart. Also, from his determination to do what he believed was right. G�nther Leitz said, &#x201c;He felt responsible for his workers, their families, for our neighbors in Wetzlar.&#x201d; Ernst Leitz put those feelings into action, and hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of people are alive today because of him.</p><p>I am a sophomore in high school, where I sing in the school choir. I have participated in National History Day for the past three years, with each topic pertaining to the Holocaust. I researched the Holocaust each year because I believe the stories of survivors and rescuers are not being told or taught as well as they could be.

Green&#x2019;s version, with its lyrical mastery and superb command of Greek, offers readers the opportunity to enjoy Homer&#x2019;s epic tale of survival, temptation, betrayal, and vengeance with all of the verve and pathos of the original oral tradition.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a triumph, a worthy successor to Peter Green&#x2019;s outstanding translation of&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Iliad.&nbsp;</i>The style is flexible, sometimes colloquial, and often touching the heights, while being always immensely accessible to a modern reader.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br>When her car sputtered and died a mile outside of Las Vegas, Darcy Wallace seriously considered staying where she was and baking to death under the brutal desert sun. She had $9.37 left in her pocket and a long stretch of road behind her that led to nowhere.<p> </p><p>She was lucky to have even that pitiful amount of cash on her, as her purse had been stolen outside a diner in Utah the night before. The rubbery chicken sandwich was the last meal she'd had, and she figured the stray ten she'd found in her pocket was the last miracle she could expect.</p><p> </p><p>Both her job and her home in Kansas were gone. She had no family and no one to go back to. She felt she'd had every reason for tossing her clothes into a suitcase and driving away from what had been, and what would have been, had she remained.</p><p> </p><p>She'd driven west simply because her car had been pointing in that direction and she'd taken it as a sign. She'd promised herself an adventure, a personal odyssey and a new, improved life.</p><p> </p><p>Reading about plucky young women who braved the world, carved a path, took risks and blithely accepted challenges was no longer enough. Or so she'd told herself as the miles had clicked away on the odometer of her ancient and sickly sedan. It was time to take something for herself, or at least to try.</p><p> </p><p>If she had stayed, she would have fallen in line. Again. Done what she was told. Again. And spent her life haunted by dreams and regrets.</p><p> </p><p>But now, one long week after sneaking out of town in the middle of the night like a thief, she wondered if she was destined for the ordinary. Perhaps she'd been born to follow all the rules. Maybe she should have been content with what life offered and kept her eyes cast down, instead of constantly trying to peek around the next corner.</p><p> </p><p>Gerald would have given her a good life, a life she knew many women would envy. With him, she could have had a lovely home tidily kept by a loyal staff, closets bursting with conventionally stylish wife&#x2013;ofthe&#x2013;executive clothes, a summer place in Bar Harbor, winter getaways to tropical climes. She would never be hungry, never do without.</p><p> </p><p>All it required was for her to do exactly as she was told, exactly when she was told. All it required was for her to keep buried every dream, every longing, every private wish.</p><p> </p><p>It shouldn't have been hard. She'd been doing it all of her life.</p><p> </p><p>But it was.</p><p> </p><p>Closing her eyes, she rested her forehead on the steering wheel. Why did Gerald want her so much? she wondered. There was nothing special about her. She had a good mind and an average face. Her own mother had described her just that way often enough. She didn't believe it was so much a physical attraction on Gerald's side, though she suspected he liked the fact she was a small woman of slight build. Easily dominated.</p><p> </p><p>God, he frightened her.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered how furious he'd been when she'd cut off her shoulder&#x2013;length hair, snipping away until it was as short as a boy's.</p><p> </p><p>Well, she liked it, she thought with a little spurt of defiance. And it was her hair, damn it, she added, pushing her fingers through choppily cut, toffeecolored locks.</p><p> </p><p>They weren't married yet, thank the Lord. He had no right to tell her how to look, how to dress, how to behave. And now, if she could just hold on, he never would have that right.</p><p> </p><p>She should never have agreed to marry him in the first place. She'd just been so tired, so afraid, so confused. Even though the regrets and the doubts had set in almost immediately, even though she'd given him back the ring and apologized, she might have gone through with it rather than stand up under his anger and live through the gossip of a broken engagement. But she'd discovered he'd manipulated her, that he was responsible for her losing her job, for the threat of eviction from her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>he'd wanted her to buckle. And she'd nearly obliged him, she thought now as she wiped sweat from her face with the back of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The hell with it, she decided and pushed herself out of the car. So she had less than ten dollars, no transportation and a mile hike ahead of her. She was out from under Gerald's thumb. She was finally, at twentythree, on her own.</p><p> </p><p>Leaving her suitcase in the trunk, she grabbed the weighty tote that contained all that really mattered to her, then headed off on foot. She'd burned her bridges. Now it was time to see what was around that next corner. </p><p> It took her an hour to reach her destination. She couldn't have explained why she kept walking along Route 15, away from the scatter of motels, gas stations, and toward that shimmering Oz&#x2013;like skyline of Vegas in the distance. She only knew she wanted to be there, inside that globe of exotic buildings and shapes where lights were twinkling like a carnival.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was tipping down below the western peaks of the red mountains that ringed that glittering oasis. Her hunger had gone from grinding distress to a dull ache. She considered stopping for food, to rest, to drink, but there was something therapeutic about simply putting one foot in front of the other, her eyes on the tall, spectacular hotels glimmering in the distance.</p><p> </p><p>What were they like inside? she wondered. Would everything be glossy and polished, colorful to the point of gaudy? She imagined an atmosphere of sex and gambling, desperation and triumph, with an underlying snicker of naughtiness. There would be men with hard eyes, women with wild laughs. She'd get a job in one of those opulent dens of indulgence and have a front row seat for every show.</p><p> </p><p>Oh, how she wanted to live and see and experience. She wanted the crowds and the noise, the hot blood and the cold nerves. Everything, everything that was the opposite of what she'd had before. Most of all she wanted to feel&#x2014;strong, ripping emotions, towering joys, vivid excitement. And she would write about it all, she determined, shifting the tote which, filled with her notebooks and manuscript pages, weighed like stone. She would write, tucked in some little room looking out at it all.</p><p> </p><p>Stumbling with exhaustion, she tripped on a curb, then righted herself. The streets were crowded, everyone seemed to have somewhere to go. Even at dusk, the lights of the city winked and gleamed and beckoned: <i>Come in, take a chance, roll the dice.</i></p><p> </p><p>She saw families of tourists&#x2014;fathers in shorts with legs pink from the unforgiving sun, children with wide eyes, mothers with the frantic look of sensory overload.</p><p> </p><p>Her own eyes were wide, the golden brown glazed with fatigue. The man&#x2013;made volcano erupted in the distance, drawing screams and cheers from the crowd who'd gathered to watch and making Darcy gape with glassy&#x2013;eyed wonder. The noise smothered the odd buzzing in her ears as she was jostled by the crowd.</p><p> </p><p>Dazed and dazzled, she wandered aimlessly, gawking at the huge Roman statues, blinking at the neon, passing by the spurting fountains that gushed with shifting colors. It was a wonderland, loud and gaudy and unapologetically adult, and she was as lost and as fascinated as Alice.</p><p> </p><p>She found herself standing in front of twin towers as white as the moon and joined together by a wide, curved bridge with hundreds of windows. Surrounding the building were seas of flowers, both wild and exotic, and pools of mirror&#x2013;bright water fed by the rush of a terraced waterfall that tumbled from the topmost spear of a mountain.</p><p> </p><p>Guarding the entrance to the bridge was an enormous&#x2014;five times larger than life&#x2014;Indian war chief astride a gold stallion. His face and bare chest were gleaming copper. His war bonnet flowed with winking stones of rich reds and blues and greens. In his hand he carried a lance with a diamond&#x2013;bright tip that winked fire.</p><p> </p><p>He's so beautiful, was all she could think, so proud and defiant.</p><p> </p><p>She would have sworn the statue's dark eyes were alive, fixed on hers. Daring her to come closer, to go inside, to take her chances.</p><p> </p><p>Darcy stepped into The Comanche on watery legs and swayed against the sudden rush of cool air.</p><p> </p><p>The lobby was immense, the tile floors a bold geometric pattern of emerald and sapphire that made her head spin. Cacti and palms grew regally out of copper or pottery urns. Brilliant floral displays graced huge tables, the scent of the lilies so sweet it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She walked on, amazed by the waterfall that rushed down a stone wall into a pond filled with bright fish, the sparkling light that shimmered from huge crystaland&#x2013;gold chandeliers. The place was a maze of color and flash, brighter and more brilliant than any reality she'd known or any dream she'd imagined.</p><p> </p><p>There were shops, the offerings in the windows as glittery as the chandeliers. She watched an elegant blonde debate between two diamond necklaces the way another might consider her choice of tomatoes.</p><p> </p><p>A laugh bubbled up in Darcy's throat, forcing her to press a hand to her mouth to hold it in. It wasn't the time or place to be noticed, she warned herself. She didn't belong in such glamorous surroundings.</p><p> </p><p>She turned the corner and felt her head reel at the sudden brassy sound of the casino. Bells and voices, the metallic rat&#x2013;a&#x2013;tat of coins falling on coins. Whirls and buzzes and hoots. The wave of energy pouring out brought a rush to her blood.</p><p> </p><p>Machines were everywhere, shoulder to shoulder with their faces spinning with colors and shapes. People crowded around them, standing, sitting on stools, pulling coins from white plastic buckets and feeding the busy machines. She watched a woman press a red button, wait for the spin to end, then scream with delight as triple black bars lined up in the center. Money poured out into a silver bowl in a musical rush.</p><p> </p><p>It made Darcy grin.</p><p> </p><p>Here was fun, reckless and impulsive. Here were possibilities both grand and small. And life, loud, messy and hot.</p><p> </p><p>She'd never gambled in her life, not with money. Money was something to be earned, saved and carefully watche...</p></p><h2>Multiplication and Division Facts for the Whole-to-Part, Visual Learner</h2><p>Students need multiplication facts to multiply and divide multidigit numbers and perform fraction operations. These facts need to be available in both multiplication and division format, and organized through a relational context so that they may be ordered and compared. Learn to provide students with a way to store, access, and express multiplication and division facts through multimodal activities that utilize visual and kinesthetic processing. The techniques presented support various learning styles and culminate in the ability to learn, compare, and express math facts in an accurate and fluent manner. This program utilizes semantic reasoning strengths, and a combination of whole-to-part processing and gross motor kinesthetic therapies to compensate for deficits in working memory, expressive language mechanisms, and executive function. Multiplication concepts and facts are linked to the student s existing knowledge base across a broad spectrum of modalities. By establishing a strong conceptual base, students are able to learn, store, and retrieve facts accurately and efficiently apply them to solve problems. Graphic organizers provide a means to hold information in working memory long enough to formulate fact sentences. Gross motor activities provide students with the ability to interact with these graphic organizers without being constrained by fine motor written output issues. This program is helpful to all, and especially valuable to those students with language-based learning difficulties.

I yelled, &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s killed Father.&#x201d; I breathed in kerosene air, licked the thickness from my teeth. The clock on the mantel ticked ticked. I looked at Father, the way hands clutched to thighs, the way the little gold ring on his pinkie finger sat like a sun. I gave him that ring for his birthday when I no longer wanted it. &#x201c;Daddy,&#x201d; I had said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m giving this to you because I love you.&#x201d; He had smiled and kissed my forehead.<br><br> A long time ago now.<br><br> I looked at Father. I touched his bleeding hand, how long does it take for a body to become cold? and leaned closer to his face, tried to make eye contact, waited to see if he might blink, might recognize me. I wiped my hand across my mouth, tasted blood. My heart beat nightmares, gallop, gallop, as I looked at Father again, watched blood river down his neck and disappear into suit cloth. The clock on the mantel ticked ticked. I walked out of the room, closed the door behind me and made my way to the back stairs, shouted once more to Bridget, &#x201c;Quickly. Someone&#x2019;s killed Father.&#x201d; I wiped my hand across my mouth, licked my teeth.<br><br> Bridget came down, brought with her the smell of decayed meaty-meat. &#x201c;Miss Lizzie, what . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the sitting room.&#x201d; I pointed through thick, wallpapered walls.<br><br> &#x201c;Who is?&#x201d; Bridget&#x2019;s face, prickly with confusion.<br><br> &#x201c;I thought he looked hurt but I wasn&#x2019;t sure how badly until I got close,&#x201d; I said.

My hands ached.<br><br> &#x201c;Miss Lizzie, yer scarin&#x2019; me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Father&#x2019;s in the sitting room.&#x201d; It was difficult to say anything else.

Babs and her husband, Hal, hosted what had become an annual event on Labor Day, a barbecue complete with friendly games, tasty grilled fare, finger food passed by well-dressed servers, and sumptuous desserts. A high-spirited memorial to the summer that had passed and the fall season now upon us. The couple's tennis court had been busy all afternoon, and the free-form pool ensured that the youngsters would be tuckered out (with puckered skin) and ready for bed when the festivities ended.<br><br> The horseshoe pit had been active all afternoon as well. The sound of the metal horseshoes hitting the iron spikes driven into the ground was a constant reminder that horseshoes was a popular game for young and old alike. I'd once read that it was a spin-off from the game of quoits, dating back two thousand years to just after horseshoes themselves had been invented. All I knew was that they seemed to get heavier with each toss, making me wonder how the poor horses managed with them nailed to their hooves.<br><br> The party had started to wind down. But the families gathering their belongings and saying their good-byes to Hal and Babs seemed equally matched by newcomers arriving unfashionably late. It was the day before the traditional start of school, explaining why this party, inevitably, lingered into the early-evening hours under the floodlights the Wirths had set up with just that expectation in mind. The sun was poised to dip behind the mountains in the distance, and those who'd elected to spend their day on the beach, a short walk from the Wirths' expansive property, brushed sand off their feet and bathing suits as they arrived.<br><br> I'd intended to join those who were leaving until Babs convinced me to team up with her for a final game of horseshoes. Our opponents were the town historian, Tim Purdy, and Brad Crandall, an old-timer known as the best horseshoe thrower in town. Standing nearby, camera in hand, was Eve Simpson, Cabot Cove's premier Realtor and gossip, two avocations that apparently went hand in hand. Eve was holding the camera but didn't seem to be taking any pictures. Servers from Cabot Cove Catering, meanwhile, filtered through the crowd, dispensing their wares with napkins to spare. A healthy assortment of the company's most delectable treats, now that we'd entered the dessert phase of the festivities, had replaced the trays of finger foods. My mouth watered at the sight of the bite-sized brownies, but I watched the last one snatched from the tray just before the server reached me.<br><br> I guess it wasn't my day.<br><br> We were down to the final tosses. Tim and Brad had twenty points, one shy of the winning number. Babs and I had surprised everyone (including ourselves) by accumulating eighteen points, three shy of the winning number of twenty-one. It was my turn to throw my two horseshoes at the iron stake, which stood forty feet from where I was poised to take what would be the final turn. I'd need a "ringer," worth three points, in which the horseshoe encircles the stake, for us to win. I didn't suffer any illusions that I was capable of such a toss, especially now that the horseshoe I was hefting felt heavier than the bicycle I often had to lift over the curb to chain in place.<br><br> "You can do it, Jess!" Babs assured me, upbeat as ever.<br><br> Her rosy voice made for a fitting match with her appearance. She had a headful of red curls that framed flawless, smooth skin that looked as though it belonged in a skilled artist's portrait. And her trim, athletic figure hadn't changed an ounce in the nine years I'd known her, as she looked more like someone who rode horses than tossed their shoes.<br><br> I eyed the stake, which seemed to be farther away than forty feet. The horseshoe, which weighed all of two and a half pounds, made me list to the side on which I was holding it. I drew a deep breath and glanced at Tim and Brad, whose bemused expressions reflected confidence in their victory. Then I closed my eyes, opened them, focused on the stake, and pitched the horseshoe, which caught the final rays of sun as it sailed through the air.<br><br> To my delight, the harsh sound of the horseshoe clanging against the iron stake rang in my ears.<br><br> "It's a ringer, Jess!" Babs yelled. "You tossed a ringer! We won!"<br><br> I guess it was my day, after all.<br><br> Tim gave me a hug. Brad, a sour expression on his weathered face, mumbled congratulations and walked away.<br><br> "Wait till I tell Hal," Babs bubbled. "Where is he?"<br><br> I fell in behind Babs in search of her husband. As we approached the sprawling New England-style house, we passed my dear friend Dr. Seth Hazlitt, who'd driven me to the gathering. People in town wonder why I've never learned to drive a car and trust my bicycle to get around, and look askance at me for having taken flying lessons and earning my private pilot's license. I'm not sure that I can adequately explain why I have a license to fly but not one that allows me to drive, and I've given up trying to figure it out myself. I guess one of the great things about Cabot Cove is you don't need a car to get around, much less a plane. I also hadn't needed either when I spent much of my time at the Manhattan apartment I seldom visited these days.<br><br> "Anything you'd like to say to Babs and Hal?" Eve Simpson said, approaching with her Canon still in her grasp. "I'm making a video for their anniversary."<br><br> I'd forgotten it was coming up. "Making a video with what?"<br><br> She held up her camera. "This."<br><br> "I thought you said video."<br><br> "I did," Eve said, shooting me the kind of stare adults aim at ten-year-olds. "This records video, too-on a memory card," she added, popping it from its slot. "See?"<br><br> I watched Eve slide the tiny thing back in. "What should I say?"<br><br> She positioned herself before me. "Whatever comes to mind. You and Seth are the last ones I need to get."<br><br> I remembered Eve spending the party circulating through the crowd with the camera dangling from her neck, mining for gossip, I thought, but now I realized her intentions had been considerably more hospitable.<br><br> "Ready whenever you are," I said.<br><br> "Just start whenever you're ready."<br><br> I smiled and plunged right in. "Congratulations, Hal and Babs. I feel like I've known you forever and I guess I have, at least since you moved to Cabot Cove. I watched your beautiful daughter, Alyssa, grow up and can only hope you've dissuaded her from becoming a writer. On the chance you haven't, my offer to serve as mentor still stands, so long as I don't have to teach her how to drive!" I stopped and moved my gaze from the camera to Eve. "How was that?"<br><br> "Perfect!"<br><br> "Ready to leave, Jessica?" Seth asked, coming up from behind me.<br><br> "Sure, but you need to record a video for Eve first, congratulating Babs and Hal on their anniversary."<br><br> "Ayuh. Sure thing. But where's the camera?"<br><br> Eve had begun to launch into her explanation anew when her eyes widened at the sight of someone passing between us and the entrance to the kitchen.<br><br> "My God, do you know who that is?"<br><br> I followed her gaze to a youngish man striding toward the outdoor bar with an empty drink glass.<br><br> "Can't say that I do."<br><br> "It's Deacon Westhausen, for God's sake."<br><br> The name rang a bell, but it took me a moment to realize the source of Eve's excitement.<br><br> "Of course, the tech giant," I said, watching as Westhausen was intercepted by a trio of party guests en route to the bar.<br><br> "Tech giant? That's putting it mildly. The man's Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson all rolled into one."<br><br> "I've read the stories, Eve," I said, not bothering to hide my lack of enthusiasm for Cabot Cove's latest local celebrity, who was building a massive home in a previously protected area of wetlands right on the bluffs forming the cove that gave our town its name. This in return for the sizable investment he'd made in the long-awaited expansion of our cherished marina. "And I've also read the stories questioning the source of his income."<br><br> "I think you're just jealous over not being the most famous person in town anymore. And look at all the jobs the amphitheater he's building at the marina has brought to town."<br><br> "Then we should dismiss the rumors about his cutting corners and using substandard building materials?"<br><br> "Yes, because that's all they are-rumors. Spread by those who are jealous of his success and all the good he's doing for this town."<br><br> "I don't count that monstrosity he's building off the docks as anything good, Eve."<br><br> She scampered across the lawn, weaving a zigzagging path toward Deacon Westhausen and leaving me to follow Babs through a door leading directly into the kitchen to say my good-byes.<br><br> "Hal?" Babs called out before I could say anything.<br><br> The kitchen was empty, or it seemed to be. But then I saw half of a man's shoe protruding from behind a large island used for prepping food. I approached it to have a better look. The shoe was attached to a leg-Hal Wirth's leg.<br><br> "Hal!" Babs shrieked.<br><br> I rushed out the door to get Seth, the primary care doctor for pretty much the entire town. But I didn't have to go far, since he was already running toward me, having heard Babs's anguished cry.<br><br> "What's wrong?" he asked as we shouldered through the door, trailed by Eve Simpson, camera in hand.<br><br> "It's Hal Wirth," I managed, barely. "I think he's dead."<br><br> Chapter Two<br><br> The sun had dipped behind the mountains when Seth and I set out behind the ambulance transporting Hal to Cabot Cove Hospital. I sat shocked in the passenger seat while Seth drove. He was uncharacteristically quiet, stunned by the tragic conclusion to what had been a joyous Labor Day. Hal's health had seemed to be fine throughout the party; he'd spent the day mixing and mingling with guests or tossing a football with a few teenagers.<br><br> There was a period of time toward the end of the day, though, when he and Seth ensconced themselves in a secluded corner of the property and sat together on a green wrought iron bench. From my vantage point, and from Hal's body language, I judged the subject of their impromptu conversation to be serious and not for other ears. They conferred for twenty minutes before Hal stood and walked away, leaving Seth alone on the bench to ponder what had transpired.<br><br> I hadn't seen him again until he lay supine in the kitchen. Had he suffered a heart attack? Although it's unusual for people in their late forties to succumb to a coronary, I'd immediately assumed that had to be the cause of his sudden collapse. Or . . .<br><br> As a mystery writer, I have to discipline myself not to imagine crimes unfolding on every corner and not to see something nefarious in every sudden and inexplicable passing. Still, in Hal's case, the fact that he'd been so buoyant just minutes before aroused my suspicions, whether warranted or not.<br><br> "I saw you and Hal huddled off by yourselves for a time, Seth," I worked myself up to say. "I have to ask what it was about."<br><br> "No, you don't, Jessica. Just like you know I can't share what we discussed. Doctor-patient privilege."<br><br> "Then you were discussing Hal's health."<br><br> "I didn't say that."<br><br> "You implied it. Just give me a notion."<br><br> "All I can tell you is that we didn't discuss his physical health."<br><br> It sounded strange the way Seth said that, but I didn't pester him further. People in Cabot Cove confided everything to Seth. He was the classic small-town doctor in an age where insurance companies were making such practices almost impossible to keep up. Seth was the exception to the rule, and I respected him too much to press him on the issue.<br><br> Meanwhile, thank heavens a medical professional had been there. Seth had recognized a pulse in Hal's jugular vein and shouted for the crowd that had gathered to call 911. He'd also instructed people to direct the paramedics to where Hal lay, while continuing to tend to him.<br><br> "Every second counts in situations like this," Cabot Cove's beloved physician said, kneeling over Hal to continue his CPR efforts.<br><br> Although the ambulance and its crew of two EMS paramedics arrived within minutes, it seemed an eternity to me. Cabot Cove's emergency personnel don't typically have much to keep them busy, although that was changing with an influx of new residents packing the town to its very gills, especially in the summer season, which was now drawing to a close. But the speed with which they showed up impressed me. Hal was fitted with an oxygen mask and rushed into the back of the ambulance. Babs, who'd been standing at the rear of the crowd, her fist pressed tightly against her lips to stifle the cry of anguish building inside, climbed into the vehicle with her husband. The sun was setting and, with it, summer itself. I could only hope the darkening sky didn't prove a portent for Hal's prognosis.<br><br> When Babs and Hal Wirth had arrived in Cabot Cove almost ten years ago, they injected a burst of youthful energy to a town that had begun to grow insular and perhaps too set in its ways. Their daughter, Alyssa, was in grade school when they chose our village as their new home, and Babs immediately threw herself into town activities, particularly as an active participant in the PTA and the historical society. She was also a skilled painter. My friend Mara was delighted to hang an exhibit of Babs�s work in her luncheonette, and one of Babs�s best-loved pieces, a seascape of the view beyond the bluffs, hung permanently on the luncheonette�s wall. I�d also bought one of her paintings, now displayed proudly in my own home.<br><br> Babs had become one of my most treasured friends, a bond that became tighter as the years passed. A woman I've trusted with my innermost sentiments and secrets, she'd always been there whenever I felt the need to reminisce about my late husband, Frank, and had done her best to put a smile on my face, a consideration I was ready to return in kind. Now that such a time had come, it would fall on me to help support her through this ordeal, facing the possibility that she was about to lose her beloved husband, just as I had lost mine. Call us kindred spirits, but not for the reasons you'd ordinarily choose.</p><h2>William Wallace</h2><p>By no means prepared by birth, education or training for leadership, Wallace nevertheless rose to prominence during the Wars of Independence, leading forces which broke the sequence of English victories and re-energising and inspiring his countrymen in the process. While others, ostensibly his betters, yielded and collaborated, Wallace set an example of constancy and perseverance and became the Guardian of Scotland. Even his terrible death in London in 1305 can be seen as a victory as it provided inspiration for the continuance of the struggle against English domination. Despite Wallace&#39;s almost mythical status - boosted in no small part by the film Braveheart - present-day perceptions of him are no always based on the objective analysis of the historical facts. In this revised and expanded biography, Andrew Fisher investigates all the aspects of Wallace&#39;s life and character, treating him as a man of his time. The result is a more authentic picture of the greatest of Scotland&#39;s heroes than has been previously available.</p><p>Andrew Fisher is archivist to the Duke of Buccleuch at Drumlanrig Castle.&#39;... this excellent biography which will certainly become prescribed reading for all interested in the Wars of Independence.&#39; - Forth Naturalist and Historian &#39;... a tremendously popular account of one of Scotland&#39;s genuine heroes...&#39; - Scottish Life</p><h2>Big Sky Secrets (Parable, Montana)</h2><p><strong>The &#x201c;First Lady of the West,&#x201d; #1 </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author Linda Lael Miller, delivers the stunning finale of her acclaimed series set in Parable, Montana&#x2014;where love awaits</strong><br><br>Self-made millionaire Landry Sutton heads to Hangman Bend&#x2019;s Ranch to sell his land to his brother, Zane.

Later, people would recall that the flakes were mistakenly perceived as a lark, a last dusting in what had been an unusually cold winter. The year 1879 was already proving to be a surprising one: on March 3, the first woman lawyer had argued a case before the Supreme Court, and despite the wretched cold, there had been an abnormally scant snowfall. Just a foot since November, which had then melted away on three strangely warm days in early February, though the thick ice on the Hudson River had not yet broken.<br><br> Emma and Claire O'Donnell were ten and seven years old, respectively. In concession to the snow, they wore boots, but because the day was already warming they donned only a light coat over their spring dresses. Their parents were similarly attired: boots in lieu of lighter, leather shoes, a woolen coat for Bonnie, a thin cloth work jacket for David. The O'Donnells lived in three rooms on the first floor of a row house on Elm Street. Every morning they left the house together, Emma and Claire for the Van Zandt Grammar School, Bonnie to her millinery shop on State Street, and David to the Lumber District.<br><br> Their farewell on the morning of March tenth at the school doors was unremarkable as farewells go: a brief wave, an affectionate reminder for Emma to take care of Claire, and noisy reluctance from the sisters, for it was annoying to have to go inside on such a splendid day. There was little reason, any of them believed, to mark the occasion: they would see one another at home for their midday meal, as they always did.<br><br> David and Bonnie walked on together through the light, powdery snow the five blocks to State Street, Albany's wide boulevard, which was graced at its summit by the new capitol building, still unfinished after twelve years of construction. It was modeled after the Louvre Palace in Paris, but its outer walls had only just been completed, giving it a faintly apologetic mien, as its facade was still missing a promised grand stairway and a plethora of decorative friezes and gargoyles. Its interior third and fourth floors were still barren hollows of scaffolding and echo. The exasperated legislature, tired of waiting, had preemptively moved into the first two, anticipating years of noise and headache ahead.<br><br> The businesses of importance-with the exception of lumber and railroading-proceeded apace below the capitol, on State Street. A languorous hill, it eased from the capitol heights down to the Hudson River, spanned here by two railroad bridges, one north and one south. The waterway had first been named the North River by the Dutch, because it allowed passage northward from the Manhattan harbor, but it had long since been renamed after its discoverer, though the early moniker persisted in Manhattan City, whose centric gaze rarely extended to the wider world. <br><br> Albany's principal economic engine was that it offered a decent port on the only navigable river a steamboat day's voyage from the bustling trade center. A stubborn Flemish perseverance had long characterized the city's public personality, which had sustained the founding Dutch through the threat of native unrest, the encroaching French, and finally the conquering English, who captured New Netherlands-essentially all of northeast America-in 1664 and renamed the inauspiciously named yet tenacious city of Beverwijck, Albany. That same perseverance had also sustained the city through year after year of seasonal floods, for though the river was an economic boon, it was also Albany's watery Achilles' heel.<br><br> But today, Monday, March 10, it was snowing, and the river was still frozen, and merchants, bankers, printers, engravers, tobacconists, reporters, druggists, lawyers, and one milliner were all converging on State Street to empty mousetraps, sweep refuse from thresholds, and deposit money into their empty tills. The mercantile neighbors waxed convivial with one another about the snow shower. Smiles, all around, and a shaking of heads. Albany.<br><br> David O'Donnell accompanied Bonnie to her shop at 59 State Street, as he did every morning. His pride at her success was exceeded only by his pride in his daughters, Emma and Claire, though if pressed, he might confess a partiality toward Emma, whose stubborn spiritedness he encouraged perhaps more than he ought. But the pressing thing now was the snow drifting lightly from the skies, and the question of whether or not it had been advisable to have erected the new awning over the mullioned shop window. Under too much accumulation of the white stuff, it would founder. But as they assessed the sky for clues, a patch of blue opened above the river, settling the issue. David kissed Bonnie's cheek, and taking his leave, descended the slippery sidewalk toward Broadway on his way to the Lumber District, where his work as a stevedore had shaped his strong body into an anvil.<br><br> "You'll not forget dinner tonight at the Sutters'?" Bonnie called after him. <br><br>"I mean the Stipps'!" <br><br>After twelve years, she still couldn't get it straight. Her beloved adopted family had grown. No one in the city of Albany knew whether to call them the Sutters or the Stipps, either. The O'Donnells were generally believed to be their blood relations, though that was not true, even as much as Bonnie wished it were. <br><br>"And if you stop for a pint on the way home," she threatened, "don't bother to come calling. I'll bolt the door against you."<br><br> Turning, David raised his arm in salute, a teasing grin skittering across his weathered face. "Dinner?" he said. "What dinner?"<br><br> "David O'Donnell, it's your fault, you know, that Emma is such a scrapper." <br><br>But Bonnie stood under her green-striped awning and admired the man as he sauntered away. David was her second husband. Her first husband, Jake Miles, had disappeared in the War of the Rebellion, and none too glad had she been to see him gone. For a brief time, she'd been in love with Christian Sutter, Amelia's only son, but he had died early in the war. And then David had spotted her on the street one day, and made a pest of himself until she fell in love with him. He had given her Emma and Claire, whom she cherished. She crossed herself to honor the two children she'd had with Jake. They had died as infants, a sadness from her unlucky past. And she made a last cross to honor Elizabeth Fall: Amelia Sutter's grandchild, whom she loved just as much as she loved her own daughters, and whom she missed, for the brilliant girl had gone with her grandmother far away to Paris to study violin at the conservatory there. Bonnie was worried about her. Lately, Elizabeth's letters had confided great sadness.<br><br> "Six o'clock! Remember!" Bonnie called after her husband.<br><br> After turning and waving, David cut down Montgomery and dashed across the tangle of railroad tracks at Spencer, then followed Water Street into the Lumber District, crossing the narrow lock bridge that separated the terminus of the Erie Canal from the port basin. A sudden, sharp gust of wind chilled the two thousand laborers pouring into the fifty lumberyards on the hundred-acre island, carved between the Erie Canal and the Hudson. David worked for Gerritt Van der Veer, the preeminent lumber baron in the city. Gerritt S. Van der Veer, it could be said, ruled Albany. Advertisements for his white pine shone down from nearly every brick building lining the grand commercial boulevards of Western Avenue and State Street. the best white pine in the world is at van der veer &amp; son lumber! While Van der Veer was a fair employer, his temper could rage when things went wrong. <br><br>This year, an unanticipated excess inventory of milled white pine had wintered over, and Van der Veer wanted to ship it the minute the frozen river opened to navigation, which he believed would be soon. His overseer, James Harley, a more reasonable man, nonetheless shouted over the rising gusts to the assembled hundred laborers of Van der Veer Lumber that this morning's first task was to clear the accumulating snow from the stacks. So David and the other longshoremen climbed the towers of plywood and joists and four-by-fours and got to work.<br><br> In their classroom at the Van Zandt Grammar School, Emma and Claire were seated two rows apart. They had been gazing out the windows at the snow, which was beginning to turn heavier, but Emma, the oldest, sighed and exchanged a despairing glance with Claire before turning her attention back to their teacher, a recent graduate of the State Normal School, who was teaching some complicated math to the older students. Claire studied Emma from the corner of her eye. It pleased Claire that people said they looked alike, with their cascades of copper hair and bright blue eyes, but that was where their resemblance ended, Claire believed. Emma was so much more clever that she was. As Emma leaned over her paper to solve a raft of division problems, Claire pretended to do the same, but instead she was secretly thinking about the party that night at the Stipps'.<br><br> Five long blocks away, Bonnie was contemplating the party, too. It was their annual celebration of the opening of her shop. This year was the sixth, and it was she who ought to be hosting since Amelia Sutter was away with Elizabeth in Paris, but Mary Stipp had insisted on continuing the annual tradition of hosting the party at their home, even in the absence of her mother and niece. It was Amelia who had provided the initial funds. Bonnie had repaid her debt long ago, but the party had become a celebration not only of Amelia's generosity, but of the families' long friendship, close ties, and remade lives. And then there was the fact that Mary Sutter Stipp had delivered both Emma and Claire, and one of her babies from Jake, who had died. Their tight bonds could never be broken.<br><br> Outside, the light dimmed as the fluffy flakes turned beady and began to pour from the sky. Casting a wary eye toward the window, Bonnie resolved to leave her shop earlier than she usually did to pick up the cake at Mariano's Bakery for tonight, but she wasn't really worried. It was March, after all, nearly spring. The snow had to let up soon. And she had work to do. She finished dusting her showcase and arranging her worktable, permitting herself a small smile of self-congratulation as she sat down to put the last touches on the hat she had been decorating for her best customer, Viola Van der Veer, the wife of Gerritt Van der Veer, David's employer and the richest man in Albany. Not that long ago-was it really twenty years?-Bonnie had been an ignorant farm girl, and now she was making hats for a woman whose patronage had ensured her success, because when Viola Van der Veer wanted something, the rest of Albany society did, too, not so much out of affection for her, but as a mark of financial equality. That collective desire had provided for, among other things, the excess funds to purchase the cherished awning. Despite the snow, Bonnie expected that Mrs. Van der Veer might stop in today, as she often did, to chat with her as she worked. The society woman's loneliness had come as a revelation, especially given Mrs. Van der Veer's standing in the community, which recently Bonnie had learned Mrs. Van der Veer considered more a chore than a position she prized. Mostly, Bonnie was honored to be the recipient of Mrs. Van der Veer's sometimes mournful confidences, and more than once she had offered the tearful woman her shoulder.<br><br> The new wide-brimmed garden hat, a style that would set to advantage Mrs. Van der Veer's tiny figure, was already laden with white egret plumage and exuberant silk peonies. Bonnie marveled at how her customers seemed oblivious of her tricks. All she had to do was juxtapose a pair of complementary colors, offer the surprise of a new pattern, or more importantly, disclose which of a client's friends-or enemies-had purchased a far superior quality of velvet, and the sale was done. In Albany society, Bonnie had learned, superiority mattered. Hard won, reaped with unsheathed claws and an enigmatic smile in ballrooms and dining rooms across the city, who was who was the business of those women, and if she, a former farm girl, provided ammunition to the struggle, then all the better. She paused and took stock. The addition of a hummingbird would finish the hat well. It was an embellishment that Viola Van der Veer loved, and Bonnie often finished her hats with that signature detail. Now she tested first one, then another of the featherlight birds, setting them in a tiny nest of straw, choosing finally a ruby-throated one, its wings aflight. <br><br> Bonnie was still holding it up to admire when a violent burst of wind pushed open the door and the iridescent bird flew out of her fingers and up toward the ceiling. So much snow was suddenly spilling from the skies that she could hardly see a thing. She fumbled for matches to light the gas jet, but a curtain of darkness had fallen. The snowfall was no longer a mere sprinkling, a last reflexive fit of winter. It was a blizzard. Bonnie instantly thought of Claire and Emma. Would they shut the schools for a storm this foul, or keep the children instead? It didn't matter. She would go get them. Unthinking, she jammed Viola Van der Veer's unfinished hat on her head and fled outside, pulling on her thin coat. Instantly, the churning wind spun her around. She regained her balance and bent low, taking first one step, then another, into the maelstrom.<br><br> In the Lumber District, James Harley, the overseer, hollered above the roar of wind for everyone to get out. Hearing Harley's cries, David leaped to the ground from the top of the stack he'd been clearing and headed toward the Lock Bridge with hundreds of his fellow laborers, each one doubting his ability to find his way home in the sudden whiteout. Despite growing panic, the men worked together, linking arms and edging across the narrow Lock Bridge, made hazardous by the accumulating snow. The snaillike pace of escape was excruciating. When it was finally his turn, David bowed his head and shuffled across, praying not to be blown into the canal. But once he successfully negotiated the bridge, it soon became impossible to know what was ground and what was sky. Gravity lied. Senses failed. By blessed dumb luck, David navigated the twelve long blocks back to State Street, staying to the lee of the buildings and marking his path by memory, his collar turned up against the frigid cold. He blundered on, finally reaching State Street, where he traveled perhaps a dozen steps up the sidewalk before he lost his sense of direction and veered into the street. The blinded driver of a heavily laden dray never saw him, nor did he grasp that the cry he heard and the sudden jolt of his sliding wheels meant that he had crushed a man.</p><h2>Recipe for Life: The Autobiography</h2><p>From Queen of Tarts to the nation's heart, Mary Berry shares her <i>Recipe for Life.</i><i> </i>From the moment she came into the world&#x2014;two weeks early, throwing her parents' lives into disarray&#x2014;Mary has gracefully but firmly done things her own way. Born in 1935, in the city of Bath, Mary's childhood was a curious mix of idyllic picnics and ramblings, and alarming air raids; of a spirited and outdoorsy home life and a dreaded school existence. All nearly cut horribly short by an almost fatal bout of polio when she was 13, which isolated Mary in hospital, away from beloved family and friends for months. Recovery saw her turn to her one true passion&#x2014;cookery. And so began a love affair that has&#x2014;so far&#x2014;spanned six remarkable decades; from demonstrating ovens in the early 1950s to producing glossy food magazines in the 1960s and 1970s, gradually becoming the country's most prolific and&#x2014;many would say&#x2014;best loved cookery writer. Until her emergence in the 21st century as a TV sensation and style icon on the <i>Great British Bake Off</i>. As a working mother, at the heart of a busy household, Mary became an expert at the art of juggling, even bringing her working life into her home with her Aga school. And there have been challenges, one terrible tragedy, and many joys along the way. In this touching, evocative, and fascinating memoir, we accompany Mary on her journey of nearly 80 years; a life lived to the full, with a wicked sense of fun and an eye for the absurd, it is the life of a delightfully traditional but thoroughly modern woman.

What was it about that encounter that would not only radically accelerate the trajectory of his life, but ultimately affect the lives of millions . . . and will most likely profoundly affect your life as well? What is this phenomenon? In his international bestseller, The Reconnection: Heal Others, Heal Yourself, Dr. Pearl taught readers how to access and tap into a comprehensive spectrum of energy, light, and information previously inaccessible to anyone, anywhere. In doing so, he allowed us to entirely transcend complex energy-healing "techniques" and bring about dramatic, often instantaneous, lifelong healings and life transformations! Since then, the world has clamored for Eric&#x2019;s second book. His response? When I have something else to say. Today Dr. Pearl, in collaboration with Frederick Ponzlov, indeed has something else to say. You might have to reconsider everything you&#x2019;ve read up until now about healing, consciousness, and our four-dimensional existence here on Earth. As guided by the spirit of Solomon, an extradimensional intelligence that speaks through Frederick, experience firsthand the insights imparted during the evolution of this unique transmodality known today as Reconnective Healing. Now you can discover these insights and apply them to your life&#x2014;insights that have revolutionized the healing world and given us the key to access the immense power that we each have within our lives.

Then in 2003 the United States did it again. How could this happen? How could the strongest power in modern history fight two wars against the same opponent in just over a decade, win lightning victories both times, and yet still be woefully unprepared for the aftermath? <br><br>Because Americans always forget the political aspects of war. Time and again, argues Gideon Rose in this penetrating look at American wars over the last century, our leaders have focused more on beating up the enemy than on creating a stable postwar environment. What happened in Iraq was only the most prominent example of this phenomenon, not an exception to the rule. <br><br>Woodrow Wilson fought a war to make the world safe for democracy but never asked himself what democracy actually meant and then dithered as Germany slipped into chaos. Franklin Roosevelt resolved not to repeat Wilson&#x2019;s mistakes but never considered what would happen to his own elaborate postwar arrangements should America&#x2019;s wartime marriage of convenience with Stalin break up after the shooting stopped. The Truman administration casually established voluntary prisoner repatriation as a key American war aim in Korea without exploring whether it would block an armistice&#x2014;which it did for almost a year and a half. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations dug themselves deeper and deeper into Vietnam without any plans for how to get out, making it impossible for Nixon and Ford to escape unscathed. And the list goes on. <br><br>Drawing on vast research, including extensive interviews with participants in recent wars, Rose re-creates the choices that presidents and their advisers have confronted during the final stages of each major conflict from World War I through Iraq. He puts readers in the room with U.S. officials as they make decisions that affect millions of lives and shape the modern world&#x2014;seeing what they saw, hearing what they heard, feeling what they felt. <br><br>American leaders, Rose argues, have repeatedly ignored the need for careful postwar planning. But they can and must do a better job next time around&#x2014;making the creation of a stable and sustainable local political outcome the goal of all wartime plans, rather than an afterthought to be dealt with once the "real" military work is over.</p><p><b>Gideon Rose </b>was recently named Editor of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, where he served as Managing Editor for the past decade.&nbsp; From 1995 to 2000, he was Olin Senior Fellow and Deputy Director of National Security Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, serving as Chairman of the Council&#x2019;s Roundtable on Terrorism and Director of numerous Council Study Groups.&nbsp; In 1994-95, he was on the staff of the National Security Council, where he served as Associate Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs.&nbsp; In addition, he has been a staff member at the journals <i>The National Interest </i>and <i>The Public Interest.</i>&nbsp; After studying classics at Yale, he received a Ph.D. in government from Harvard and has taught American foreign policy at Princeton and Columbia.&nbsp; His previous publications, edited with James F.

Terrorism and the New War</i>.&nbsp; He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b><b>1<br><br>THE CLAUSEWITZIAN CHALLENGE</b></b><br><br>In late March 2003, the United States and a few allies invaded Iraq. Some of the war&#x2019;s architects thought things would go relatively smoothly once the enemy was beaten. As National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it in early April, &#x201c;We fundamentally believe that when the grip of terror that Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s regime has wreaked on its own people is finally broken and Iraqis have an opportunity to build a better future, that you are going to see people who want to build a better future&#x2014;not blow it up.&#x201d;1<br><br>Others involved in the operation were more apprehensive. Lieutenant Colonel Steven Peterson was on the military staff that planned the ground campaign. He noted afterward:<br><br>Over a month before the war began, the Phase IV planning group concluded that the campaign would produce conditions at odds with meeting strategic objectives. They realized that the joint campaign was specifically designed to break all control mechanisms of the [Iraqi] regime and that there would be a period following regime collapse in which we would face the greatest danger to our strategic objectives. This assessment described the risk of an influx of terrorists to Iraq, the rise of criminal activity, the probable actions of former regime members, and the loss of control of WMD that was believed to exist. It ... identified] a need to take some specific actions including: planning to control the borders, analyzing what key areas and infrastructure should be immediately protected, and allocating adequate resources to quickly re-establish post-war control throughout Iraq.<br><br>These concerns and recommendations were brought to the attention of senior military leaders, &#x201c;but the planners failed to persuade the Commanding General and dropped these issues with little resistance.&#x201d;<br><br>In retrospect, this episode seems mystifying. It is bad enough not to see trouble coming. But to see it coming and then not do anything about it might be even less forgivable. How could such crucial, and ultimately prescient, concerns have been dismissed and abandoned so cavalierly? &#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Peterson continued,<br><br>both the planners and the commander had been schooled to see fighting as the realm of war and thus attached lesser importance to post-war issues. No officer in the headquarters was prepared to argue for actions that would siphon resources from the war fighting effort, when the fighting had not yet begun.... Who could blame them? The business of the military is war and war is fighting. The war was not yet started, let alone finished, when these issues were being raised. Only a fool would propose hurting the war fighting effort to address post-war conditions that might or might not occur.2<br><br>Lieutenant General James Conway, the commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, which helped capture Baghdad, was even more succinct. Asked whether postwar planning inevitably gets short shrift compared to planning for combat, he replied, &#x201c;You know, you shoot the wolf closer to the sled.&#x201d;3<br><br>The Iraq War will long be remembered as a striking example of such attitudes and their unfortunate consequences, but it is hardly the only one. In fact, the notion of war-as-combat is deeply ingrained in the thinking of both the American military and the country at large. Wars, we believe, are like street fights on a grand scale, with the central strategic challenge being how to beat up the bad guys. This view captures some basic truths: America&#x2019;s enemies over the years have been very bad indeed, and winning wars has required beating them up. But such a perspective is misleading because it tells only half the story.<br><br>Wars actually have two equally important aspects. One is negative, or coercive; this is the part about fighting, about beating up the bad guys. The other is positive, or constructive, and is all about politics. And this is the part that, as in Iraq, is usually overlooked or misunderstood.<br><br>The coercive aspect of war involves fending off the enemy&#x2019;s blows while delivering your own, eventually convincing your opponent to give up and just do what you want. This is why Carl von Clausewitz, the great Prussian military theorist, defined war as &#x201c;an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&#x201d; The constructive aspect involves figuring out what it is that you actually want and how to get it. This is why Clausewitz also defined war as &#x201c;an act of policy ... simply a continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means.&#x201d;4<br><br>Keeping this dual nature of war fully in mind at all times is difficult. It means recognizing that every act in war has to be judged by two distinct sets of criteria&#x2014;political and military&#x2014;and perhaps even by two distinct institutional sources of authority. This is messy, and nobody likes a mess. So there is a great temptation for governments to clean up matters by creating a clear division of responsibility. Civilians should deal with political matters, in this view, and military leaders should deal with military matters, and control should be handed off from the politicians and diplomats to the generals at the start of a conflict and then back to the politicians and diplomats at the end. As U.S. Central Command (Centcom) commander Tommy Franks put it to the deputy secretary of defense on the eve of the Iraq War, &#x201c;<i>You pay attention to the day</i> after, <i>I&#x2019;ll pay attention to the day</i> of.&#x201d;5<br><br>Unfortunately, the clear-division-of-labor approach is inherently flawed, because political issues can permeate every aspect of war. The flaws can sometimes be obscured during the early and middle stages of a conflict, as each side tries to defeat the other on the battlefield. But at some point, every war enters what might be called its endgame, and then any political questions that may have been ignored come rushing back with a vengeance. &#x201c;The main lines along which military events progress,&#x201d; Clausewitz observed, &#x201c;are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace.... To bring a war, or one of its campaigns, to a successful close requires a thorough grasp of national policy. On that level strategy and policy coalesce: the commander-in-chief is simultaneously a statesman.&#x201d;6<br><br>With the war&#x2019;s general outcome starting to become clear, the endgame is best thought of as a discussion over what the details of the final settlement will be and what will happen after the shooting stops. The problem is that this discussion, whether implicit or explicit, takes place under extremely trying circumstances. At least some officials on both sides may now be considering sheathing their swords, but they are doing so against the backdrop of the fighting itself: the triumphs and disasters experienced, the blood and treasure spent, the hopes and passions raised. By this point, moreover, leaders and publics have usually gotten so caught up in beating the enemy that they find it hard to switch gears and think clearly about constructing a stable and desirable political settlement. So they rarely handle endgame challenges well and usually find themselves at the mercy of events rather than in control of them.<br><br>Americans have fared on average no better than others in these situations, and sometimes worse. The country&#x2019;s leaders have rarely if ever closed out military conflicts smoothly and effectively. Trapped in the fog of war, they have repeatedly stumbled across the finish line without a clear sense of what would come next or how to advance American interests amid all the chaos. They have always been surprised by what is happening and have had to improvise furiously as they pick their way through an unfamiliar and unfriendly landscape.<br><br>For all endgames&#x2019; drama and historical importance, however, they have received far less attention than other phases of war. A few books look at the ends of individual wars, and there is a small academic literature on what political scientists call war termination.7 But in general, endgames have been as neglected by scholars as they have been by policymakers. This book is intended to help fix that problem. It tells the stories of the ends of American wars over the last century, exploring how the country&#x2019;s political and military leaders have handled the Clausewitzian challenge of making force serve politics in each major conflict from World War I to Iraq.<br><br>From one angle, therefore, this is a book about American history. Drawing on a broad range of primary and secondary sources, as well as extensive original interviews with participants in the more recent conflicts, I have tried to re-create the endgame choices that presidents and their advisers confronted during each war. The goal is to put readers inside the room with U.S. officials as they make decisions that affect millions of lives and shape the modern world&#x2014;seeing what they saw, hearing what they heard, feeling what they felt.<br><br>From another angle, though, this is a book about how to think about war, foreign policy, and international relations more generally. Marx once noted, &#x201c;Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please,&#x201d; and in this, at least, he was exactly right. The agency that American leaders have displayed&#x2014;their freedom of action to choose one course over another&#x2014;has been constrained by various kinds of structures, aspects of their environment that nudged them toward some courses rather than others. To explain endgame decisionmaking properly, therefore, you have to focus not on agency or structure alone, but on how they interact.<br><br>As for which kinds of constraints on policymakers matter most, this is a matter of intense debate inside the academy. Followers of &#x201c;realist&#x201d; theories argue that a country&#x2019;s foreign policy is concerned above all with the pursuit of its security and material interests. Look to power politics and the country&#x2019;s external environment, they say, and you can predict how its leaders will behave. Critics of realism, in contrast, argue that foreign policy is driven primarily by internal factors, such as domestic politics, political ideology, or bureaucratic maneuvering. And followers of psychological theories, finally, argue that foreign policy is shaped by the cognitive structures inside leaders&#x2019; minds&#x2014;such as the lessons they have drawn from the country&#x2019;s last war. Throughout the book, I weigh the relative merits of these different approaches in accounting for what happened in each war. My conclusion is that all of them help explain at least some things some of the time, but a surprisingly large amount of the picture can be sketched out by looking at power and lessons alone. (The technical term for the theoretical approach I follow here&#x2014;one that begins with power factors but then layers on other variables to gain greater insight&#x2014;is &#x201c;neoclassical realism.&#x201d;8)<br><br>From a third angle, finally, this is a book about future policy and strategy. The specific mix of factors that led to chaos in Iraq after Baghdad fell are not going to come together again, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean similar mistakes won&#x2019;t be repeated. Time and again throughout history, political and military leaders have ignored the need for careful postwar planning or approached the task with visions of sugarplums dancing in their heads&#x2014;and have been brought up short as a result. But there is simply no reason this process has to play itself out over and over, and if officials can manage to learn a few general lessons from past failures, perhaps it won&#x2019;t.<br><b><b>THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE</b></b><br><br>For two and a half years, Woodrow Wilson kept the United States aloof from formal participation in World War I, entering in early 1917 only in response to Germany&#x2019;s unrestricted submarine attacks. While neutral, Wilson had tried to end the conflict through negotiations and a &#x201c;peace without victory.&#x201d; He eventually added a grand international organization to his postwar wish list, an institutional arrangement that would oversee a liberal global order and help the world transcend the evils of war and the balance of power. When the United States finally joined the war, these objectives did not change; rather, Wilson and the nation came to identify German militarism as the main obstacle to achieving them. But since the Allies never really bought into Wilson&#x2019;s idealistic vision, they too presented an obstacle that had to be overcome.<br><br>During 1918, American intervention made German defeat inevitable, setting up an intricate triangular dance during the war&#x2019;s endgame. Germany sought to get off as easy as possible. The Allies sought the opposite, trying to recoup their losses and more at German expense. And Wilson, in the middle, pushed for &#x201c;regime change&#x201d; in Germany while trying to play both sides off against each another and usher in a new and better world. This delicate balancing act would probably have collapsed even if a master manipulator such as Bismarck were in charge&#x2014;and the stiff-necked, high-minded Wilson was no Bismarck.<br><br>As a neutral, the United States had been unable to get the settlement it wanted because the two evenly matched European coalitions were determined to fight the war to a finish. By becoming a belligerent, Wilson gained a seat at the peace table, but only by helping one side win, paving the way for just the sort of illiberal peace he was desperate to avoid. With no reason to take American concerns seriously once the fighting was done, the Allies simply did what they wanted. And so the tragedy of Versailles&#x2014;of hapless American attempts to forestall Allied impositions on a prostrate German Republic&#x2014;is best understood as the working out of the tensions inherent in the war&#x2019;s final acts.<br><br>A generation later, the United States was back battling the Germans once again. The American effort in World War II was partly a fight <i>against</i> the Axis: the Roosevelt administration chose to seek total victory over its enemies and then achieved it. But the American effort was also a fight <i>for</i> a certain vision of international political and economic order. Even before the Japanese attacked, American leaders had hoped for a postwar settlement that would provide the United States and the world with lasting peace and prosperity.<br><br>The negative and positive fights occurred simultaneously, but American policymakers did not link them very well. In particular, they failed to recognize that even the total defeat of the Axis powers would be only a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the emergence of their desired postwar order. Washington had to ally with Stalin to destroy Hitler, and the price of that alliance was giving the Soviets control of half of Europe after the war. The reality of this Faustian bargain took a while to sink in, however, and so the endgame of the positive fight continued long after VE Day&#x2014;until the emergence of NATO and the postwar settlement in the late 1940s and early &#x2019;50s.<br><br>The Cold War, in other words, is best understood not as some new struggle, but rather as a continuation of the positive fight America had already been pursuing for several years. Given the Soviet Union&#x2019;s different vision for the world, such a clash was probably inevitable; only one side&#x2019;s abdication of the field could have prevented it. But the disillusionment and hysteria accompanying its onset was not inevitable, and stemmed in part from the failure of the Western allies to...</p><h2>Craft Cider Making</h2><p>Fully revised and updated, this guide offers step-by-step instruction for small scale cider making.

Yet this tradition is arguably the most faithful representative of early Christianity in existence today and numbers roughly 250 million adherents worldwide. What's more, a steady stream of evangelical Christians has been entering the Orthodox Church in recent decades. Isn't it time we gained a deeper understanding of Orthodoxy? In <em>Light from the Christian East,</em> James Payton gives us just that. With a sympathetic eye and even hand, he ushers readers into the world of Orthodox Christianity--its history, theology and religious practices. In doing so, he clears away the confusion and misunderstandings that often prevent non-Orthodox Christians from fully appreciating the riches of this ancient tradition. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in Orthodox Christianity.</p><p><strong>James R. Payton Jr.</strong> (Ph.D., University of Waterloo, Canada) is a professor of history at Redeemer University College in Ancaster, Ontario. He has studied and been in dialogue with Eastern Orthodoxy for many years, and has lectured and written extensively on Orthodoxy and Protestant-Orthodox relations. He is president of Christians Associated for Relationships with Eastern Europe."For anyone interested in learning more about Eastern Orthodoxy, James R. Payton, Jr. leads his reader on an informative tour through the theology and practices of this tradition. Payton deeply appreciates what he finds in the Orthodox tradition and urges his Western readers to do the same."

(Frederica Mathewes-Green, author of The Illumined Heart: The Ancient Christian Path of Transformation)<br><br>"In a day when people look to the Far East for truth and light, Dr. Payton suggests that they consider the Christian East as well.

Pinnock, Professor Emeritus of Systematic Theology, McMaster Divinity College)<br><br>"This is a lucidly written, highly approachable book that highlights some of the key distinctions between the 'Christian East' and the 'Christian West.' It shows the theological thinking of the Orthodox East to be the best-kept secret in the West. It will invite other studies that will rightly seek to draw the lines a little less sharply, but such responses will benefit greatly from the clarity of Payton's preliminary exposition." (Peter Bouteneff, D.Phil., assistant professor of dogmatic theology, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This is a book for those who want a more comprehensive vision of the Christian faith without feeling the need to convert to the Orthodox Church.

A handpicked team of the country's top architects conducted a secret inspection of the troubled mansion and, after discovering it was in imminent danger of collapse, insisted that the First Family be evicted immediately. What followed would be the most historically significant and politically complex home-improvement job in American history. While the Trumans camped across the street at Blair House, Congress debated whether to bulldoze the White House completely, and the Soviets exploded their first atomic bomb, starting the Cold War.</p><br><p>Indefatigable researcher Robert Klara reveals what has, until now, been little understood about this episode: America's most famous historic home was basically demolished, giving birth to today's White House. Leaving only the mansion's facade untouched, workmen gutted everything within, replacing it with a steel frame and a complex labyrinth deep below ground that soon came to include a top-secret nuclear fallout shelter.</p><p>The story of Truman's rebuilding of the White House is a snapshot of postwar America and its first Cold War leader, undertaking a job that changed the centerpiece of the country's national heritage. The job was by no means perfect, but it was remarkable&#x2015;and, until now, all but forgotten.</p></p><p>ROBERT KLARA is the author of the critically acclaimed 2010 book <i>FDR's Funeral Train</i>, which historian and author Douglas Brinkley called "a major new contribution to U.S. history."

May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof. <br>&#x2014;letter from President John Adams to his wife; quote chiseled into the State Dining Room&#x2019;s mantel <br> <i>There is a</i> story about President Calvin Coolidge taking a walk around the White House grounds one evening with Missouri senator Selden P. Spencer, who pointed to the luminous mansion of carved sandstone and remarked, jokingly, &#x201c;I wonder who lives there.&#x201d; The lugubrious Coolidge responded, &#x201c;Nobody. They just come and go.&#x201d;1 <br>Indeed they do, and no two stories of how a new president and his family come to live in America&#x2019;s most famous house are alike. Most, however, share a common trait: The White House is a prize that candidates fight for, often for years. But a handful of others gain admittance by fate alone, and this was the case with Harry S. Truman. &#x201c;If there ever was a man who was forced to be President,&#x201d; Truman once said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m that man.&#x201d;2 The news reached him and his family on the afternoon of April 12, 1945. It struck them like a bolt of lightning. It came, fittingly, in the middle of a rainstorm. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In those days, the Trumans lived in a second-floor apartment at 4701 Connecticut Avenue, in a quiet neighborhood tucked into the city&#x2019;s northwestern quadrant, not far from Rock Creek Park. On that April afternoon, Bess glanced out the window at moody gray skies over the city and did not like the looks of them. Her husband&#x2014;a last-minute choice to be Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x2019;s vice president&#x2014;was scheduled to fly up to Rhode Island to deliver a speech. Air travel frightened Bess Truman; many things did. <br>Down the hall, the Trumans&#x2019; daughter, Margaret, was primping in her bedroom mirror. The twenty-one-year-old college junior was preparing for a date that evening. A few feet away sat the cantankerous Madge Wallace, Bess&#x2019;s eighty-two-year-old mother, who was visiting from Missouri. Grandma Wallace hurled one probing question after another about the evening&#x2019;s suitor, while Margaret, dabbing on her makeup, minted perfect responses. She knew the drill by now. Nearly twenty-six years earlier, Madge Wallace had lost Bess at the altar to that &#x201c;dirt farmer&#x201d; Harry Truman, and she was bent on assuring that her lovely granddaughter didn&#x2019;t wind up with a bum, too.3 <br>Harry Truman was far from being a bum, but his salary as public servant had never amounted to much. In the eleven years since Harry&#x2019;s narrow election to the Senate in 1934, the Trumans had lived in a series of tiny apartments. Back home in Independence, the Wallace family home was a fourteen-room Victorian with stained-glass parlor windows. But Washington was a big town. Beginning with the family&#x2019;s first flat&#x2014;a cramped price gouger at $150 a month&#x2014;getting by had been difficult.4 <br>It was why the Trumans adored 4701 Connecticut Avenue so much. They&#x2019;d chanced on their two-bedroom apartment in 1941, and the onset of the war would show them just how lucky they&#x2019;d been. World War II brought a scarcity of everything, especially housing. In 1942, Washington&#x2019;s population swelled by a quarter of a million people, all of whom went looking for apartments. Soon, ten thousand boardinghouses were operating in the capital city, many filled with young women from the hinterlands, &#x201c;government girls&#x201d; who&#x2019;d arrived to push the paperwork of war. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In a city of old row houses and overcrowded hostelries, the Trumans&#x2019; building was a vision from a fairy tale&#x2014;a white brick prewar of five stories embracing a leafy courtyard trimmed with flower beds. Apartment 209 faced the front and took in the morning sun. It had two bathrooms, a sleeping porch, and even enough space for Margaret&#x2019;s Steinway baby grand. For all this, the family paid $120 a month. Truman&#x2019;s recent elevation to the vice presidency had bumped his monthly take-home pay to exactly $982.45, making their apartment an outright steal.5 And yet the attachment they&#x2019;d formed with their apartment had since run deeper than the family budget. As solid Missouri stock, the Trumans lived modestly. Ostentation made them uncomfortable. So far as they cared, FDR was welcome to the carved paneling and marble fireplaces of the White House; the Trumans were perfectly happy with their rental.6 <br>At 6:00 P.M., the telephone rang. Margaret walked over and answered it. It was her father calling. Margaret began her usual kidding with him&#x2014;telling him she had a date and wouldn&#x2019;t be home for dinner&#x2014;but Truman cut her off and demanded to speak with &#x201c;Mother.&#x201d;7 Confused and hurt over her father&#x2019;s uncharacteristic &#x201c;voice of steel,&#x201d; Margaret surrendered the phone and trooped back to her room.8 Bess Truman took the receiver and nestled it into her graying curls. <br>&#x201c;Bess,&#x201d; Truman barked, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the White House. President Roosevelt died about two hours ago. I&#x2019;m sending a car for you and Margaret. I want you here when I&#x2019;m sworn in.&#x201d;9 And then he hung up. <br>In their nearly twenty-six years of marriage, Bess Truman had never heard a tone in her husband&#x2019;s voice quite like the one that echoed in her head now as she put the receiver back on the hook. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>It&#x2019;s not known whether the Truman women said anything to each other as the heavy black limousine thrummed the cobblestones on its way down to the White House, but they didn&#x2019;t have to. Already, the realization was dawning that the lives they&#x2019;d known for the past eleven years had been swept away in the time it took to answer a phone. Moments after the conversation had ended, a reporter from the Associated Press raced up the stairs to knock on the apartment door. Still in her slip, Margaret opened it without thinking&#x2014;only to slam it back shut in the reporter&#x2019;s face. Bess and Margaret tried to sneak out of the building through the back door, but the press had already staked the whole place out, leaving them to run a gauntlet of photographers before reaching the limousine. This, they knew, was only the beginning. <br>They&#x2019;d been so lucky up to now. Until a cerebral hemorrhage felled him in his cottage retreat down in Warm Springs, Georgia, FDR had been the most captivating president of the twentieth century. His laughter, his crafty storytelling, that thousand-watt smile&#x2014;all of it kept the newsmen in a permanent state of distraction. It permitted the Trumans to live as ordinary people. Margaret pursued her B.A. in history at George Washington University. Bess would slide behind the wheel of her &#x2019;41 Chrysler Windsor to visit the stores downtown, where, to her enduring delight, nobody recognized her.10 Bess&#x2019;s shock and grief over Roosevelt&#x2019;s passing were genuine, but before long it became clear to her that she was actually mourning not one loss, but two&#x2014;a president, and her privacy.11 <br>Now the news of FDR&#x2019;s death cut into radio broadcasts and spread in whispers down the sidewalks. Traffic on Connecticut Avenue knotted between Cumberland and Chesapeake streets as drivers slowed up to rubberneck at the building where the new president lived.12 Or <i>used</i> to live. What were the chances the Trumans could ever go back there now? <br>As the crow flies, the White House stood only four miles from 4701 Connecticut Avenue. To Bess&#x2019;s mind, the place might as well have been on the moon. Decorum would, of course, require her to feign happiness over the chance to live in the executive mansion. Privately, though, she made her true feelings about the White House clear. &#x201c;I just dread moving over there,&#x201d; she said.13 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The White House wasn&#x2019;t ready to take them anyway, at least not yet. The days following FDR&#x2019;s death had plunged the usual efficiency of the mansion into chaos. No sooner had Harry Truman been sworn in than the planning for Roosevelt&#x2019;s funeral began. The Roosevelts&#x2019; things had to be packed up. FDR and Eleanor had lived in the White House for twelve years. Their Victorian love of clutter had, by the end, left the mansion looking like a Paris flea market. Truman took it upon himself to ease the strain on Mrs. Roosevelt. &#x201c;Now don&#x2019;t you be in any hurry to leave the White House,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Take all the time you need in the world.&#x201d;14 What the new president failed to understand was that hurrying was one thing Eleanor Roosevelt <i>liked</i> to do. On Monday, April 16, the day after her husband was laid in his grave, she pulled on an old pair of shoes and a tattered housedress and began tagging furniture, oil paintings, ship models, and barrels of china. &#x201c;The amount of packing to be done was appalling,&#x201d; Elliott Roosevelt remembered, but his mother refused to slow down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be out by Friday,&#x201d; she warbled, and she meant it.15 <br>As the movers came and went, usher J. B. West decided all the activity was good cover for a personal mission. Taking a notebook in hand, he quietly slipped out of the mansion, crossed the street, and climbed the steps of the yellow town house just off Lafayette Square. He wanted to meet Mrs. Truman, his new boss. <br>The door on which West was knocking belonged to Blair House, the White House&#x2019;s official guest residence. The Secret Service had decided to install the Truman family there immediately after FDR&#x2019;s funeral. The agents had learned by degrees what Bess had probably suspected from the start: A president simply cannot live in an apartment building. The Trumans&#x2019; neighbors at 4701 Connecticut Avenue had been good sports about it all&#x2014;the security checkpoint hastily set up in the lobby, the demands for identification. But, as Margaret re...</p><h2>Deepa&#39;s Secrets: Slow Carb New Indian Cuisine</h2><p><i><b>Winner of the 2018 James Beard Foundation Book Awards * Winner of the World Gourmand Cookbook Awards * Finalist for the IACP Awards *Shortlisted for the NCIBA Book Awards, Best Cookbook</b></i><br><br>A journey from old traditions to modern Indian cooking with deliciously simple and gut-healing recipes that leave you feeling fulfilled&#x2014;rather than full.<br><br>Upon learning that rice and bread were the culprits for her husband&#x2019;s Type 2 diabetes, Deepa Thomas deconstructed and reinvented her native Indian cuisine.

Some genes, including those that shape our bodies, actually adapt to outside influences. In <i>Turn Off the Fat Genes</i>, Dr. Neal Barnard draws on this cutting-edge research to create a revolutionary new program to help your body sculpt away excess pounds by activating thin genes and suppressing fat ones. The heart of Dr. Barnard&#x2019;s book is a three-week gene-control program specifically designed to help you identify your gene types by asking questions like:<br><br> What&#x2019;s your genetic taste type? Do you strongly dislike Brussels sprouts? Are some desserts too sweet to eat? Is black coffee undrinkable? If you answered yes to all three questions you&#x2019;re a genetic bitter &#x201c;taster&#x201d; or &#x201c;supertaster&#x201d; (as opposed to a &#x201c;nontaster&#x201d;). You&#x2019;ll find out how to work with your genetic taste type.<br><br> Is your appetite becoming harder to control? Have diets made your appetite unpredictable? If so, your hunger-suppressing leptin gene might need a tune-up.&nbsp;<br><br> Do you gain weight more easily than your friends? Do you have difficulty losing weight no matter what you do? If so, the genes that set your metabolism might need a boost.<br><br> Do you hate exercise? If so, your genes may have overloaded you with sluggish Type II muscle cells. Learn how to change them.<br><br> Once we understand how the genes that control shape can be influenced, we can enjoy virtually the same effortless weight control as naturally thin people and reveal the healthy, vital body that nature intended us to have.</p><p>&#x201c;No one knows more about healthy diets than Dr. Neal Barnard. . . .

It provides pastors concrete guidance on how to draw boundaries that facilitate community engagement while still maintaining the crucial distance that fosters enduring leadership.</p><p>David C. Olsen is executive director of the Samaritan Counseling Center of the Capital Region and an adjunct faculty member of the Sage Graduate School. <br><br>Nancy G. Devor is senior staff psychologist at the Danielsen Institute at Boston University.Clergy sexual misconduct gets the most attention when boundary violations are discussed. Olsen and Devor believe that focus gets in the way of addressing the need for other kinds of boundaries that help ministry to flourish. They argue that boundary problems mostly arise when there is confluence between unresolved personal issues on the part of a pastor and high stress in the congregational system itself. Boundary maintenance is needed not only so that pastors don&#x2019;t burn out, but so that congregations can thrive. Pastors may set boundaries that are too rigid, which tends to drive people away. Olsen and Devor recommend the formation of clergy groups in which people hold each other accountable to boundary awareness and maintenance. (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>[T]his outstanding resource explores appropriate boundaries in ministry, boundaries that 'promote and contribute to health. . .and excellence in ministry,' that is, the health and well-being of both the minister and his family as well as that of the community. The authors contend that 'successful boundaries are a team effort,' involving both the clergy and the community of faith. This book is an important read for priests, presvyteres and leaders in our parishes. (<i>Clergy Couple Care</i>)<br><br>Drawing upon wisdom gained through years of individual and group work with clergy, the authors make plain complex psychological theories about why religious leaders want to please congregations, and why congregational systems become anxious. With riveting illustrations they explore the deadly interaction between clergy seeking affirmation and congregations consumed with anxiety. Saying No to Say Yes provides a much needed road map for clergy whose family history makes them want to please congregations made anxious by financial pressures. (Carrie Doehring PhD, Associate Professor, Iliff School of Theology)<br><br>The authors&#x2019; wide experience working with pastors and congregations, informed by their rich psychological knowledge, infuses their vision of pastoral excellence that is grounded in thoughtful self-awareness, strong support systems, and wise choices. The wisest choices, they say, are those that allow pastors to maintain healthy boundaries with their churches, their ministries, and their own histories. This is essential reading for pastors who aspire to healthy lives of effective service. (Rev. Paul E. Hopkins PhD, author of Pursuing Pastoral Excellence)<br><br>Devor and Olsen tackle head-on the complex and murky reality of boundaries in the life of the church and invite us to notice the &#x201c;zones&#x201d; where we need to tread cautiously. Rather than focus on the drama of sexual misconduct, they clarify how the setting of good boundaries is vital to both clergy and the church. Saying No to Say Yes invites us to deepen our day-to-day practice of setting individual and collective boundaries in a way that is clear, accessible, and life-giving.

It brings women back to basics. Back to the transcendence of motherhood&#x2014;physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. It goes into the Bible to discover our Creator&#x2019;s design for women, and specially mothers.</p> <p>You can enjoy this manual personally or use it as a Bible Study Manual to discuss with other women. You will discover that motherhood is the most powerful role given to women. Mothers not only influence their children, but ultimately communities, nations, and generations to come.</p> <p>Let&#x2019;s think for a moment of all the amazing things that have happened, are happening, and will happen in this world--the remarkable inventions, the incredible feats both intellectually and physically, the astounding advancements, and the brilliant discoveries. None of this happens on its own. Every single one happens through a person. And that person comes through the womb of a mother. Without the nurturing in the womb of the mother, NOTHING happens in this world. It all comes to a halt.</p> <p>God creates women physically for mothering. It&#x2019;s the way they&#x2019;re made. It&#x2019;s an instinctive role. If they don&#x2019;t mother children, they&#x2019;ll nurture cats or dogs. They are physically preserved through mothering with less likelihood of female cancers.</p> <p>Therefore, if mothering is so powerful, why is it disdained our society today? Sadly, women today are fed the jargon that motherhood is insignificant. They are propagandized to be the opposite of who they were created to be. They are programmed to delay marriage, disdain men, delay childbearing, or forget it altogether. But what do they reap in the end? No husband, children, and grandchildren around them to fill their lives with joy and continuing new adventures</p> <p>It&#x2019;s time for women to know truth. You&#x2019;ll be surprised! God has a lot to say to women! Good things. Great things. New revelations on every page and there are nearly 250 pages in this manual.</p> <p>As you read this manual, you will embark on a journey of discovering who you are as a female and how to fulfil your destiny on this earth.&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Miracles do happen</h2><p>Living proof that love works miracles...<br><br>Today, the power of the miraculous is very much a part of our lives, from appearances of the Virgin Mary at Medjugorje, Yugoslavia, to the places where Sister Briege McKenna has healed the sick and the lame.<br><br>Once so crippled by rheumatoid arthritis that medication was ineffective and a wheelchair was her future, Sister Briege experienced a sudden, remarkable healing-and received the gift of healing others.<br><br>So began Sister Briege's renowned worldwide ministry.

As Rome&#x2019;s first emperor, Augustus transformed the unruly Republic into the greatest empire the world had ever seen. His consolidation and expansion of Roman power two thousand years ago laid the foundations, for all of Western history to follow. Yet, despite Augustus&#x2019;s accomplishments, very few biographers have concentrated on the man himself, instead choosing to chronicle the age in which he lived. Here, Anthony Everitt, the bestselling author of Cicero, gives a spellbinding and intimate account of his illustrious subject. <br><br>Augustus began his career as an inexperienced teenager plucked from his studies to take center stage in the drama of Roman politics, assisted by two school friends, Agrippa and Maecenas. Augustus&#x2019;s rise to power began with the assassination of his great-uncle and adoptive father, Julius Caesar, and culminated in the titanic duel with Mark Antony and Cleopatra.<br>The world that made Augustus&#x2013;and that he himself later remade&#x2013;was driven by intrigue, sex, ceremony, violence, scandal, and naked ambition. Everitt has taken some of the household names of history&#x2013;Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Antony, Cleopatra&#x2013;whom few know the full truth about, and turned them into flesh-and-blood human beings.<br><br>At a time when many consider America an empire, this stunning portrait of the greatest emperor who ever lived makes for enlightening and engrossing reading. Everitt brings to life the world of a giant, rendered faithfully and sympathetically in human scale. A study of power and political genius, Augustus<i> </i>is a vivid, compelling biography of one of the most important rulers in history.</p><p>Anthony Everitt, visiting professor in the visual and performing arts at Nottingham Trent University, has written extensively on European culture, has contributed to <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>Financial Times</i>, and is the author of <i>Cicero</i>. He once served as secretary general of the Arts Council of Great Britain. Everitt lives near Colchester, England&#x2019;s first recorded town, founded by the Romans.Chapter 1<br><br>SCENES FROM A PROVINCIAL CHILDHOOD<br><br>63&#x2013;48 b.c.<br><br>Velletri is a compact hill town about twenty-five miles southeast of Rome. It lies at the southern edge of the Alban Hills, overlooking a wide plain and distant mountains. The walk from the railway station to the center is a steep, hot climb.<br><br>Little remains of ancient Velitrae, but signs of the Renaissance are to be found everywhere. In the main square stands an old fountain with battered lions spouting water. The streets leading off the piazza are roughly parallel and are gridded, echoing the original pattern of the old Roman vici. At the town&#x2019;s highest point, where the citadel must have been, a sixteenth-century palazzo communale, which combines the functions of town hall and museum, was built on the foundations of a Roman building.<br><br>Here, on a stone platform, the modern life-size statue in bronze of a man in his late teens gazes blankly from empty eye sockets into the far distance, contemplating the life that has yet to unfold. This is Gaius Octavius, Rome&#x2019;s future ruler Augustus: for Velitrae was his hometown and Velletri is proud to celebrate his memory.<br><br>Gaius would recognize the lay of the land, the rise and fall of streets and alleys, perhaps the layout, certainly the views. Now as then, this is a provincial place, which seems farther from the capital city than it really is. Change has always come slowly. The community leaves a powerful impression of being self-contained and a little isolated. Even today, elderly locals squint blackly at strangers.<br><br>A certain dour feeling for tradition, a suspicion of newfangled ways, a belief in propriety, have always been typical of provincial life in towns such as Velitrae, and it would be hard to imagine a more conventional family than that into which Gaius Octavius was born in 63 b.c.<br><br>Every Roman boy received a praenomen, or forename, such as Marcus, Lucius, Sextus&#x2014;or Gaius. Then came his clan name, or nomen, such as Octavius. Some but not all Romans also had a cognomen, which signified a family subset of a clan. Successful generals were sometimes awarded a hereditary agnomen; for example, Publius Cornelius Scipio added Africanus to his existing names, in honor of his victory over Hannibal in north Africa. By contrast, girls were only known, inconveniently, by the feminine version of their nomen; so Gaius&#x2019; two sisters were both known as Octavia.<br><br>An important feature of the infant Gaius&#x2019; inheritance was that, although like most Italians the Octavii held Roman citizenship, they were not of &#x201c;Roman&#x201d; stock. Velitrae was an outpost on the borders of Latium, home of the Latin tribes that, centuries before, had been among the first conquests of the aggressive little settlement beside a ford on the river Tiber.<br><br>Two hundred years before Gaius&#x2019; birth, Rome finally united the tribes and communities of central and southern Italy through a network of imposed treaties. The men of these lands provided the backbone of the legions and were eventually, as late as the eighties b.c., incorporated into the Republic as full citizens. The little boy grew up with a clear impression of the contribution that Rome&#x2019;s onetime opponents were making to its imperial greatness, a contribution not always fully recognized by the chauvinists in the capital. In a real sense, the Roman empire would be better called the Italian empire.<br><br>The Octavii were a well-respected local family of considerable means. A Vicus Octavius, or Octavius Street, ran through Velitrae&#x2019;s center (just as a Via Ottavia does today), past an altar consecrated by a long-ago ancestor.<br><br>The family seems to have been in trade, a sure sign that it was not of aristocratic status. Gaius&#x2019; paternal great-grandfather fought in Sicily as a military tribune (a senior officer in a legion, or regiment) during the second war against the great merchant state of Carthage in northern Africa (218 to 201 b.c.). Carthage&#x2019;s comprehensive defeat was the first indication to the Mediterranean world that a new military power had arrived on the scene. Gaius&#x2019; grandfather, who lived to an advanced age, was well-off, but had no ambitions for a career in national politics, being apparently content to hold local political office.<br><br>Later hostile gossip claimed that the great-grandfather was an ex-slave who, having won his freedom, made a living as a rope maker in the neighborhood of Thurii, a town in Italy&#x2019;s deep south. It was also rumored that the grandfather was a money changer, with &#x201c;coin-stained hands.&#x201d; Friendly propagandists took a different tack and invented a fictitious link with a blue-blooded Roman clan of the same name.<br><br>When he came to write his memoirs many years afterward, Gaius merely noted that he &#x201c;came from a rich old equestrian family.&#x201d; The equites, or knights, were the affluent middle class, occupying a political level below that of the nobility and members of the ruling Senate, but often overlapping with them socially. To qualify for equestrian status, they needed to own property worth more than 400,000 sesterces, and were not actively engaged in government. They were usually wealthy businessmen or landed gentry who preferred to avoid the expense and dangers of a political career. Many were contracted by the state to collect taxes on its behalf from the provinces. By the time of the boy&#x2019;s father, also named Gaius Octavius, the family had become seriously rich, and probably far exceeded the equestrian minimum.<br><br>The father Octavius, an ambitious man, decided to pursue a career in politics at Rome with a view to making his way, if he could, to the top. This was an extremely difficult project. The Roman constitution was a complicated contraption of checks and balances, and the odds were stacked against an outsider&#x2014;a novus homo, or &#x201c;new man&#x201d;&#x2014;from winning a position of authority.<br><br>Rome became a republic in 509 b.c., after driving out its king and abolishing the monarchy. The next two centuries saw a long struggle for power between a group of noble families, patricians, and ordinary citizens, plebeians, who were excluded from public office.<br><br>The outcome was an apparent victory for the people, but the old aristocracy, supplemented by rich plebeian nobles, still controlled the state. What looked in many ways like a democracy was, in fact, an oligarchy modified by elections.<br><br>The Roman constitution was the fruit of many compromises and developed into a complicated mix of laws and unwritten understandings. Power was widely distributed and there were multiple sources of decision-making.<br><br>Roman citizens (only men, for women did not have the vote) attended public meetings called assemblies, where they passed laws and elected politicians to govern the Republic. These leaders doubled as generals in time of war. Although in theory any citizen could stand for public office, candidates usually came from a small group of very rich, noble families.<br><br>If successful, politicians passed through a set sequence of different jobs, a process called the cursus honorum or honors race. The first step on the ladder, taken at the age of thirty or above (in practice, younger men were often elected), was to become one of a number of quaestors; this post entailed supervising the collection of taxes and making payments, either for the consuls in Rome or for provincial governors. Then, if he wished, a man could be elected one of four aediles, who were responsible for the administration of the city of Rome. During festivals they staged public entertainments at their own expense, so deep pockets were needed. The next position, that of praetor, was compulsory. Praetors were senior officers of state, responsible for presiding as judges in the law courts and, when required, to lead an army in the field.<br><br>At the top of the pyramid were two consuls, who were heads of government with supreme authority; they were primarily army commanders and conveners of the Senate and assemblies.<br><br>Consuls and praetors held imperium, officially sanctioned absolute power, although they were constrained in three important ways. First, they held office only for one year. Second, there were always two or more officeholders at the same level. Those of equal rank were allowed to veto anything that their colleagues or junior officeholders decided. Finally, if they broke the law, officeholders could face criminal charges once they were out of office.<br><br>On top of that, ten tribunes of the people were elected, whose task was to make sure that officeholders did nothing to harm ordinary Romans (patricians were not allowed to be tribunes). They could propose laws to the Senate and the people and were empowered to convene citizens&#x2019; assemblies. The tribunes held power only within the city limits, where they could veto any officeholder&#x2019;s decisions, including another tribune&#x2019;s.<br><br>The power of the assemblies was limited. They approved laws&#x2014;but only those that were laid before them. Speakers supported or opposed a proposed measure, but open debate was forbidden; all that citizens were allowed to do was vote. There were different kinds of assembly, each with its own rules: in the assembly that elected praetors and consuls, for example, the voting system was weighted in favor of property owners in the belief that they would act with care because they had the most to lose if any mistakes were made.<br><br>The Roman constitution made it so easy to stop decisions from being made that it is rather surprising that anything at all got done. The Romans realized that sometimes it might be necessary to override the constitution. In a grave emergency, for a maximum of six months, a dictator was appointed who held sole power and could act as he saw fit.<br><br>The Roman Senate was mainly recruited from officeholders. By Octavius&#x2019; day, a quaestor automatically became a lifelong member, and he and his family joined Rome&#x2019;s nobility (if he was not already a member of it). Senators were prohibited by law from engaging in business, although many used agents or front men to circumvent the ban.<br><br>In theory, the Senate held little official power and its role was merely to advise the consuls. However, because the Senate was a permanent feature of the government, whereas consuls and other officeholders had fixed terms, its authority and influence were very great. It was responsible for managing foreign affairs, and it discussed laws before they were presented to the assemblies. Its decrees, although not legally binding, were usually obeyed.<br><br>The Senate appointed former consuls and praetors, called proconsuls and propraetors (Octavius was one), to rule Rome&#x2019;s provinces, usually for between one and three years.<br><br>The equites, who as has been mentioned were not members of the Senate, formed a second social class, mainly comprising businessmen and country gentry. Beneath them came ordinary citizens, listed in different categories according to their wealth. The poorest citizens were capite censi, the &#x201c;head count.&#x201d;<br><br>Modern governments employ many thousands of administrators who carry out their decisions. This was not the case during the Roman Republic. There were no bureaucrats, apart from a few clerks who looked after the public treasury. There was no police force, no public postal system, and no fire service, and there were no banks. There was no public criminal prosecution or judicial service, and cases were brought by private citizens. Elected politicians acted as judges in the law courts. The consuls brought in servants and slaves from their households, as well as personal friends, to help run the government.<br><br>Gaius Octavius won a quaestorship, probably in 70 b.c., and joined the Senate. This was no mean achievement for a country gentleman outside the magic circle of Roman politics. The promise of political success brought with it an important benefit: a wife from one of Rome&#x2019;s great patrician clans.<br><br>Octavius was already married to a woman of whom history has recorded nothing except for her name, Ancharia. The couple had a daughter, and perhaps Ancharia died in childbirth, for families with only one child were rare, especially if the child was a girl. Her family was of obscure origin; she may have come from Velitrae or thereabouts. She would have been no help to an ambitious young man&#x2019;s career and, if alive, must have been divorced. Her removal from the scene enabled Octavius to achieve a splendid alliance, when he married Atia, a member of the Julian family.<br><br>The Julii traced their ancestry to before the city&#x2019;s foundation, traditionally set at 753 b.c. The legend went that when, after a ten-year siege, the Greeks sacked the city of Troy on what is now the Turkish coast near the Dardanelles, they killed or enslaved most of the leading Trojans. One exception was Aeneas, the son of the love goddess Venus and a handsome young warrior. He escaped the city&#x2019;s destruction with some followers and after many adventures made landfall in Latium. His son Iulus (sometimes also called Ascanius) founded the Julian dynasty.<br><br>By the first century b.c., high birth was not sufficient to guarantee political success. Money was also required, and in large quantities. The Julii were impoverished; for long generations few of them had won important posts in the honors race. Like aristocratic families before and since that fall on hard times, they used marriage as a means of income generation.<br><br>The current head of the family, Gaius Julius Caesar, was a rising politician in his late thirties, about the same age as Octavius. Talented, amusing, and fashionable, he had a voracious appetite for cash and had built up enormous debts to feed both his lifestyle and his career. One of his sisters married Marcus Atius Balbus, a local worthy from Aricia, a town not far from Velitrae. Balbus was not prominent in public life and his greatest attraction must have lain in the fact that he was a man of substance.<br><br>As a new man, Octavius knew that his dubious ancestry would damage his career. A commodious dowry would be of value in a wife, but what he really needed was entr�e into the Roman nobility. As a niece of Julius Caesar, Balbus&#x2019; daughter Atia was well placed to make that possible. Because the Balbi lived not far from Octavius&#x2019; home base of Velitrae, they may well have traveled in the same social circles. In that case, Atia formed an ambitious man&#x2019;s bridge from provincial life to Rome.<br><br>Sometime before 70 b.c., the couple married and, in due course, Atia became pregnant. Disappointingly, the outcome was a second daughter. Five or six years passed before another child arrived: a son, this time, Gaius. He was born just before sunrise on September 23, 63 b.c., at Ox Heads, a small property on the slopes of the fashionable Palatine Hill, a few minutes&#x2019; walk from Rome&#x2019;s main square, the Forum, and the Senate House.<br><br>By tradition, the paterfamilias held the power of life and death over his household, both his relatives and his slaves. When a child was born, the midwife took the infant and placed it on the floor in front of the father. Should the father wish to acknowledge his paternity, he would lift the baby into his arms if it was a boy; if a girl, he would simply instruct that she be fed. Only after this ritual had taken place did the child receive his or her first nourishment.</p><h2>The Ascent of Mount Carmel: Reflections</h2><p>Saint John of the Cross is one of Christianity greatest poets and mystics.

When MGM stars found themselves in trouble, it was Eddie and Howard who took care of them--solved their problems, hid their crimes, and kept their secrets. They were "the Fixers." At a time when image meant everything and the stars were worth millions to the studios that owned them, Mannix and Strickling were the most important men at MGM. Through a complex web of contacts in every arena, from reporters and doctors to corrupt police and district attorneys, they covered up some of the most notorious crimes and scandals in Hollywood history, keeping stars out of jail and, more importantly, their names out of the papers. They handled problems as diverse as the murder of Paul Bern (husband of MGM's biggest star, Jean Harlow), the studio-directed drug addictions of Judy Garland, the murder of Ted Healy (creator of The Three Stooges) at the hands of Wallace Beery, and arranging for an unmarried Loretta Young to adopt her own child--a child fathered by a married Clark Gable.<p> Through exhaustive research and interviews with contemporaries, this is the never-before-told story of Eddie Mannix and Howard Strickling.

In this provocative challenge to US policy and strategy, Donald Stoker argues that America endures endless wars because its leaders no longer know how to think about war, particularly limited wars. He reveals how ideas on limited war and war in general evolved against the backdrop of American conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. These ideas, he shows, were flawed and have undermined America&#39;s ability to understand, wage, and win its wars, and to secure peace afterwards. America&#39;s leaders have too often taken the nation to war without understanding what they want or valuing victory, leading to the &#39;forever wars&#39; of today.

Ronda&#x2019;s second marriage was dissolving after less than a year, her career as a pioneering female Washington State Trooper had ended, but she was optimistic about starting over again. "I&#x2019;m actually looking forward to getting on with my life," she told her mother earlier the night before. "I just need a few days with you guys." Barb Thompson, Ronda&#x2019;s mother, who had met her daughter&#x2019;s second husband only once before, was just happy that Ronda was coming home. <br><br>At 6:20 that morning, Ron Reynolds called 911 and told the dispatcher his wife was dead. She had committed suicide, he said, although he hadn&#x2019;t heard the gunshot and he didn&#x2019;t know if she had a pulse. EMTs arrived, detectives arrived, the coroner&#x2019;s deputy arrived, and a postmortem was conducted. Lewis County Coroner Terry Wilson, who neither visited the death scene nor attended the autopsy, declared the manner of Ronda&#x2019;s death as "undetermined." Over the next eleven years, Coroner Wilson would change that manner of death from "undetermined" to "suicide," back to "undetermined"&#x2014;and then back to "suicide" again. <br><br>But Barb Thompson never for one moment believed her daughter committed suicide. Neither did Detective Jerry Berry or ballistics expert Marty Hayes or attorney Royce Ferguson or dozens of Ronda&#x2019;s friends. For eleven grueling years, through the ups and downs of the legal system and its endless delays, these people and others helped Barb Thompson fight to strike that painful word from her daughter&#x2019;s death certificate. <br><br>On November 9, 2009, a precedent-setting hearing was held to determine whether Coroner Wilson&#x2019;s office had been derelict in its duty in investigating the death of Ronda Reynolds. Veteran true-crime writer Ann Rule was present at that hearing, hoping to unbraid the tangled strands of conflicting statements and mishandled evidence and present all sides of this haunting case and to determine, perhaps, what happened to Ronda Reynolds, in the chill still of that tragic December night.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime.

Time and again the right wins over voters by claiming that their solutions are only common sense, even as their tired policies of budgetary sacrifice and corporate plunder both create and prolong economic disaster. Why does the electorate keep buying what they're selling? According to political communications expert Anat Shenker-Osorio, it's all about language and not just theirs, but ours.<br><br>In <i>Don't Buy It</i> Shenker-Osorio diagnoses our economic discourse as stricken with faulty messages, deceptive personification, and, worst of all, a barely coherent concept of what the economy actually is. Opening up the business section of most newspapers or flipping on cable news unleashes an onslaught of economic doomsaying that treats the economy as an ungovernable force of nature. Alternately, by calling the economy unhealthy&#x201d; or recovering&#x201d; as we so often do, we unconsciously give it the status of a living being. No wonder Americans become willing to submit to any indignity required to keep the economy happy. Tread lightly, we can't risk irritating the economy!<br><br>Cutting through conservative myth-making, messaging muddles, and destructive misinformation, Shenker-Osorio suggests a new way to win the most important arguments of our day. The left doesn't have to self-destruct every time matters economic come to the fore there are metaphors and frames that can win, and Shenker-Osorio shows what they are and how to use them.<br><br><i>Don't Buy It</i> is a vital handbook for seizing victory in the economic debate. In the end, it convincingly shows that radically altering our politics and policies for the better is a matter of first changing the conversation literally.</p><p><p><b>Anat Shenker-Osorio</b> is a strategic communications consultant based in Oakland, CA.

PART I CHRISTIANS IN A NON-CHRISTIAN SOCIETY Chapter 1 INVOLVEMENT: IS IT OUR CONCERN? It is exceedingly strange that any followers of Jesus Christ should ever have needed to ask whether social involvement was their concern, and that controversy should have blown up over the relationship between evangelism and social responsibility. For it is evident that in his public ministry Jesus both &#39;went about ... teaching ... and preaching&#39; (Matthew 4:23; 9:35 RSV) and &#39;went about doing good and healing&#39; (Acts 10:38 RSV). In consequence, &#39;evangelism and social concern have been intimately related to one another throughout the history of the Church ... Christian people have often engaged in both activities quite unselfconsciously, without feeling any need to define what they were doing or why.&#39; The evangelical heritage of social concern2 There were some remarkable examples of this in eighteenthcentury Europe and America.The Evangelical Revival, which stirred both continents, is not to be thought of only in terms of the preaching of the gospel and the converting of sinners to Christ; it also led to widespread philanthropy, and profoundly affected society on both sides of the Atlantic. John Wesley remains the most striking instance. He is mainly remembered as the itinerant evangelist and open-air preacher. And so he was. But the gospel he preached inspired people to take up social causes in the name of Christ. Historians have attributed to Wesley&#39;s influence rather than to any other the fact that Britain was spared the horrors of a bloody revolution like France&#39;s.3 The change which came over Britain during this period was well documented in J.Wesley Bready&#39;s remarkable book, England Before and After Wesley, subtitled &#39;The Evangelical Revival and Social Reform&#39;. His research forced him to conclude that &#39;the true nursingmother of the spirit and character values that have created and sustained Free Institutions throughout the English-speaking world&#39;, indeed &#39;the moral watershed of Anglo-Saxon history&#39;, was &#39;the much-neglected and oft-lampooned Evangelical Revival&#39;. Bready described &#39;the deep savagery of much of the 18th century&#39;, which was characterized by &#39;the wanton torture of animals for sport, the bestial drunkenness of the populace, the inhuman traffic in African negroes, the kidnapping of fellow-countrymen for exportation and sale as slaves, the mortality of parish children, the universal gambling obsession, the savagery of the prison system and penal code, the welter of immorality, the prostitution of the theatre, the growing prevalence of lawlessness, superstition and lewdness; the political bribery and corruption, the ecclesiastical arrogance and truculence, the shallow pretensions of Deism, the insincerity and debasement rampant in Church and State -- such manifestations suggest that the British people were then perhaps as deeply degraded and debauched as any people in Christendom.&#39; But then things began to change. And in the nineteenth century slavery and the slave trade were abolished, the prison system was humanized, conditions in factory and mine were improved, education became available to the poor, trades unions began, etc., etc. &#39;Whence, then, this pronounced humanity? -- this passion for social justice, and sensitivity to human wrongs? There is but one answer commensurate with stubborn historical truth. It derived from a new social conscience. And if that social conscience, admittedly, was the offspring of more than one progenitor, it nonetheless was mothered and nurtured by the Evangelical Revival of vital, practical Christianity -- a revival which illumined the central postulates of the New Testament ethic, which made real the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of men, which pointed the priority of personality over property, and which directed heart, soul and mind, towards the establishment of the Kingdom of Righteousness on earth.&#39; The Evangelical Revival &#39;did more to transfigure the moral character of the general populace, than any other movement British history can record&#39;. For Wesley was both a preacher of the gospel and a prophet of social righteousness. He was &#39;the man who restored to a nation its soul&#39;. The evangelical leaders of the next generation were committed with equal enthusiasm to evangelism and social action. The most famous among them were Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, James Stephen, Zachary Macaulay, Charles Grant, John Shore (Lord Teignmouth), Thomas Babington, Henry Thornton, and of course their guiding light, William Wilberforce. Because several of them lived in Clapham, at that time a village three miles south of London, and belonged to Clapham Parish Church, whose Rector John Venn was one of them, they came to be known as &#39;the Clapham Sect&#39;, although in Parliament and in the press they were mocked as &#39;the Saints&#39;. It was their concern over the plight of the African slaves which first brought them together. Three days before his death in 1791, John Wesley wrote to Wilberforce to assure him that God had raised him up for his &#39;glorious enterprise&#39; and to urge him not to be weary of welldoing. It is largely to the Clapham Sect (under Wilberforce&#39;s leadership) that the credit belongs for the first settlement of freed slaves in Sierra Leone (1787), the abolition of the trade (1807), the registration of slaves in the colonies (1820), which put an end to slave smuggling, and finally their emancipation (1833). It is true that &#39;the Saints&#39; were wealthy aristocrats, who shared some of the social blindspots of their time, but they were extremely generous in their philanthropy, and the range of their concerns was extraordinary.</p><h2>The Ithaqua Cycle: The Wind-Walker of the Icy Wastes</h2><p>The elusive, utterly supernatural Ithaqua roams the North Woods and the wastes beyond, as invisible as the wind.

Her awards included the Pulitzer Prize, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the Aiken Taylor Award, the Poet&#x2019;s Prize, and the Harvard Arts and Robert Frost medals.So bountiful a poet is Pultizer Prize winner Kumin, she has put together her second selected collection, which combines poems from her last five collections with a harvest of glowing new work. Farm and family life in New Hampshire are Kumin&#x2019;s wellsprings, while her lexicon is built out of the names of plants, rocks, trees, birds, and animals. Kumin favors couplets for their parallels and opposites, but whatever form she chooses, her vital rhythms match a horse&#x2019;s canter, a human&#x2019;s stride. She looks to animals for wisdom, from a dog&#x2019;s delight &#x201c;in the moment&#x201d; as opposed to our constant worries about the past and the future, to an old, ailing broodmare who turns suddenly young again in the presence of a companionable gelding. Kumin is earthy and hands-on but hardly rustic as she jets off to Bulgaria and Bangkok; keenly parses Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the women who suffered their obsessions; and decisively critiques Bush-era torture and lies. But Kumin always circles back to the giving land, the clasp of family, and her bedrock belief in the power of art. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Death in the East: A Novel (Wyndham &amp; Banerjee Mysteries)</h2><p><p><strong>Calcutta police detective Captain Sam Wyndham and his quick-witted Indian Sergeant, Surrender-Not Banerjee, are back for another exotic adventure set in 1920s India.</strong></p><p>1905, London.</p><p>As a young constable, Sam Wyndham is on his usual East London beat when he comes across an old flame, Bessie Drummond, attacked in the streets.

The discovery of a stab wound in his stomach extinguishes any hope that this was a tragic accident. Erlendur and his team embark on their investigation with little to go on but the news that the boy&#39;s Thai half-brother is missing. Is he implicated, or simply afraid for his own life? The investigation soon unearths tensions simmering beneath the surface of Iceland&#39;s outwardly liberal, multicultural society. A teacher at the boy&#39;s school makes no secret of his anti-immigration stance; incidents are reported between Icelandic pupils and the disaffected children of incomers; and, to confuse matters further, a suspected paedophile has been spotted in the area. Meanwhile, the boy&#39;s murder forces Erlendur to confront the tragedy in his own past. Soon, facts are emerging from the snow-filled darkness that are more chilling even than the Arctic night.</p><p>Arnaldur Indridason worked for many years as a journalist and critic before he began writing novels.

The boy looked as if he had lain down to take a rest. She had difficulty controlling herself, did not want to believe what she saw.<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t move him,&#x2019; Erlendur said calmly. He was standing by the body with Sigurdur �li.<br><br>&#x2018;He must have been cold,&#x2019; El�nborg muttered, withdrawing her hand and slowly getting to her feet.<br><br>It was the middle of January. The winter had been reasonable until the New Year, when the temperature dropped sharply. The ground was now covered in a solid coating of ice and the north wind howled and sang around the blocks of flats. Rippling sheets of snow swept along the ground. They collected into little drifts here and there and fine powder snow swirled away from them. Straight from the Arctic, the wind bit their faces and penetrated their clothes, cutting to the bone. Erlendur thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his winter coat and shuddered. The sky was heavy with cloud and it was dark, although it had only just turned four o&#x2019;clock.<br><br>&#x2018;Why do they make military trousers like that for children?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>The three of them stood hunched over the boy&#x2019;s body. The blue flashing lights of the police cars bounced off the surrounding houses and blocks of flats. A few passers-by had gathered by the cars. The first reporters had arrived. Forensics were photographing the scene, their flashes vying with the blue lights. They sketched the layout of the area where the boy was lying and the immediate surroundings. The forensic investigation was in its initial stages.<br><br>&#x2018;Those trousers are in fashion,&#x2019; El�nborg said.<br><br>&#x2018;Do you think there&#x2019;s something wrong with that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked. &#x2018;Kids wearing trousers like those?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;Yes, I find it odd,&#x2019; he added after a pause.<br><br>He looked up at the block of flats. People were outside on the balconies watching, in spite of the cold. Others stayed indoors and made do with the view through the window. But most were still at work and their windows were dark. The officers would have to go to all the apartments and talk to the residents. The witness who had found the boy said that he lived there. Perhaps he had been alone and had fallen off the balcony, in which case this could be recorded as a nonsensical accident. Erlendur preferred that theory to the idea of the boy having been murdered. He could not pursue that thought through to the end.<br><br>He scrutinised the surroundings. The garden behind the flats did not seem well kept. In the middle was a patch of gravel that served as a little playground. There were two swings, one broken so that the seat hung down to ground level and spun around in the wind; a battered slide that had originally been painted red but was now patchy and rusty, and a simple see-saw with two little seats made from bits of wood, one end frozen solid to the ground and the other standing up in the air like the barrel of a large gun.<br><br>&#x2018;We need to find his boot,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.<br><br>They all looked at the sock with the hole in it.<br><br>&#x2018;This can&#x2019;t be happening,&#x2019; El�nborg sighed.<br><br>Detectives were searching for footprints in the garden but darkness was falling and they couldn&#x2019;t see much on the frozen ground. The garden was covered with a coat of slippery ice, occasional clusters of grass poking through it. The district medical officer had confirmed the death and was standing where he thought he would be sheltered from the gale, trying to light a cigarette. He was uncertain about the time of death. Somewhere in the past hour, he thought. He had explained that the forensic pathologist would calculate the exact time of death by correlating the degrees of frost with the body temperature. On first impression the doctor could not identify a cause of death. Possibly a fall, he said, looking up at the gloomy block.<br><br>The body had not been disturbed. The pathologist was on his way. If possible he preferred to visit the crime scene and examine the surroundings with the police. Erlendur was concerned at the ever-growing crowd gathering at the corner of the block, who could see the body lit up by the flashing cameras. Cars cruised slowly past, their passengers absorbing the scene. A small floodlight was being erected to enable a closer examination of the site. Erlendur told a policeman to cordon off the area.<br><br>From the garden, none of the doors appeared to open out onto a balcony from which the boy might have fallen. The windows were all shut. This was a large block of flats by Icelandic standards, six storeys high with four stairwells. It was in a poor state of repair. The iron railings round the balconies were rusty. The paint was faded and in some places it had flaked off the concrete. Two sitting-room windows with a single large crack in each were visible from where Erlendur stood. No one had bothered to replace them.<br><br>&#x2018;Do you suppose it&#x2019;s racially motivated?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, looking down at the boy&#x2019;s body.<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think we should jump to conclusions,&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>&#x2018;Could he have been climbing up the wall?&#x2019; El�nborg asked as she, too, looked up at the apartment block.<br><br>&#x2018;Kids do the unlikeliest things,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li remarked.<br><br>&#x2018;We need to establish whether he might have been climbing up between the balconies,&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>&#x2018;Where do you think he&#x2019;s from?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li wondered.<br><br>&#x2018;He looks Asian to me,&#x2019; El�nborg said.<br><br>&#x2018;Could be Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li reeled off.<br><br>&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t we say he&#x2019;s an Icelander until we find out otherwise?&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>They stood in silence in the cold, watching the drifting snow pile up around the boy. Erlendur looked at the curious bystanders at the corner where the police cars were parked. Then he took off his coat and draped it over the body.<br><br>&#x2018;Is it safe doing that?&#x2019; El�nborg asked with a glance in the direction of the forensics team. According to procedure they were not even supposed to stand over the body until forensics had granted permission.<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>&#x2018;Not very professional,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.<br><br>&#x2018;Has no one reported the boy missing?&#x2019; Erlendur asked, ignoring his remark. &#x2018;No enquiries about a lost boy of this age?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I checked that on the way here,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;The police haven&#x2019;t been notified of any.&#x2019;<br><br>Erlendur glanced down at his coat. He was cold.<br><br>&#x2018;Where&#x2019;s the person who found him?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got him in one of the stairwells,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said. &#x2018;He waited for us. Called from his mobile. Every kid carries a mobile phone these days. He said he&#x2019;d taken a shortcut through the garden on his way home from school and stumbled across the body.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll talk to him,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;You check whether they can find the boy&#x2019;s tracks through the garden. If he was bleeding he might have left a trail. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t fall.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t forensics handle that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li mumbled to deaf ears.<br><br>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t appear to have been attacked here in the garden,&#x2019; El�nborg said.<br><br>&#x2018;And for God&#x2019;s sake, try to find his boot,&#x2019; Erlendur said as he walked off.<br><br>&#x2018;The boy who found him . . .&#x2019; Sigurdur �li began.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said, turning round.<br><br> &#x2018;He&#x2019;s also col . . .&#x2019; Sigurdur �li hesitated.<br><br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;An immigrant kid,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.<br>The boy sat on a step in one of the stairwells of the block of flats, a policewoman sat with him. He had his sports kit wrapped up in a yellow plastic bag and eyed Erlendur with suspicion. They had not wanted to make him sit in a police car. That could have led people to conclude that he was implicated in the boy&#x2019;s death, so someone had suggested that he wait in the stairwell instead.<br><br>The corridor was dirty. An unhygienic odour pervaded the air, mingling with cigarette smoke and cooking smells from the flats. The floor was covered in worn linoleum and the graffiti on the wall seemed illegible to Erlendur. The boy&#x2019;s parents were still at work. They had been notified. He was dark-skinned with straight jet-black hair that was still damp after his shower, and big white teeth. He was dressed in an anorak and jeans, and holding a woollen hat in his hands.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s awfully cold,&#x2019; Erlendur said, rubbing his hands.<br><br>The boy was silent.<br><br>Erlendur sat down beside him. The boy said that his name was Stef�n and he was thirteen. He lived in the next block of flats up from this one and had done so for as long as he could remember. His mother was from the Philippines, he said.<br><br>&#x2018;You must have be...</p><h2>My Servants the Prophets</h2><p>&#34;Dr. E. J. Young has again brought to the Christian trade a work which excels in its biblical content. This text on the prophetic institution is not a run-of-the-mill work in either its thesis or presentation. The literary style is a blend of simplicity and lucidity. The thesis cuts across the general view concerning the correct basis for interpreting the prophets and advances a strict adherence to the rule, &#39;let Scripture interpret Scripture.&#39;&#34; - Christian Life &#34;This reviewer must confess that he is impressed with the saneness and thoroughness of Dr. Young&#39;s exegetical technique. Dr. Young is obviously a scholar of no mean ability; and this book, as well as others by him . . . , provides ample proof that he has been well trained in the field of Semitic philology.&#34; - Interpretation</p><p>Edward J.

Based on a sequence of mystical visions she received in 1373, her book is called <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em>. Julian lived through an age of political and religious turmoil, as well as through the misery of the Black Death, and her writing engages with timeless questions about life, love, and the meaning of suffering. But who was Julian of Norwich? And what can she teach us today? Medievalist and TV historian Janina Ramirez invites you to join her in exploring Julian's remarkable life and times, offering insights into how and why her writing has survived, and what we can learn from this fourteenth-century mystic whose work lay hidden in the shadows of her male contemporaries for far too long.</p><p>Janina Ramirez is the course director on the undergraduate certificate and diploma in history of art at Oxford University. She has written and presented numerous <em>BBC</em> history documentaries, and is the author of <em>The Private Lives of the Saints: Power, passion and politics in Anglo-Saxon England </em>.

Learn more at petersis.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;S�s's latest picture book fuses an episode from his childhood with the plot of Robinson Crusoe&#x2014;a favorite novel when he was young. Sequential panels lead to full-bleed double spreads as the first-person accounts describe the way a group of five diverse friends play pirates in every conceivable setting, from a backyard tent to the bathtub. When the school costume party is announced, the collective choice is obvious, until Peter's mother suggests that he go as Crusoe. The ensuing drama&#x2014;contrasting the boy's anticipation about wearing the lovingly crafted outfit with embarrassment as the friends (unfamiliar with the story) tease him&#x2014;is one that will resonate with many readers. A dream sequence follows the boy's retreat to his room, where the bed becomes a boat, and he floats "in and out of hours, or maybe days." The artist's signature meticulously detailed watercolor and ink scenes become looser, stylized, the colors more saturated&#x2014;think Matisse's Fauve period. Peter enters lush landscapes, a maze of tropical fruit and wild creatures, and nurturing green and blue scenes of exquisite beauty. He takes on the persona of his favorite protagonist, "owning" the costume at last. Ever on the lookout for pirates, he makes peace with his friends in a deeply satisfying conclusion. Visual references to earlier books, nods to Maurice Sendak, and a photograph with the author's note describing the incident that inspired this tale all provide depth and insight. VERDICT S�s's ability to represent and resolve the theater unfolding in children's minds is unparalleled. A brilliant adventure to share one-on-one or with a small group.&#x2014;Wendy Lukehart, District of Columbia Public Library</p><h2>Kansas Troubles (Benni Harper Mystery)</h2><p>After a whirlwind marriage to San Celina Police Chief Gabe Ortiz, Benni Harper is excited to visit her Kansas hometown. At a rowdy backyard barbecue, she meets Tyler Brown, an aspiring country singer with a promising future--and a fascinating past. Once, Tyler had lived the simple Amish life. Now she&#39;s determined to make it on her own selling her exquisite handmade quilts. But Tyler&#39;s gifts--and her life--are cut short when she&#39;s murdered. Out of his jurisdiction, Gabe is frustrated to sit on the sidelines while his friends are investigated by his own sleuthing wife. And Benni realizes that her hasty marriage will be much like Kansas weather: unpredictable and bound to be stormy...</p><p><b>Earlene Fowler</b> was raised in La Puente, California, by a Southern mother and a Western father. She lives in Southern California with her husband, Allen, a large number of quilts, and twenty pairs of cowboy boots.Newly married California museum curator Benni Harper travels to Kansas to meet her in-laws in this third of Fowler's quilt-pattern series (after Irish Chain). Police chief Gabe Ortiz, her husband, assures her that everyone in his small hometown will love her, but Benni, whose father, eccentric Aunt Dove and Uncle Arnie are driving from California to be with them, isn't so sure. At a party given by Gabe's sister, she introduces herself to Tyler Brown, whose quilt on the sister's living room wall she admires. Tyler, who says she left her Amish family a year ago to pursue a singing career, is visibly upset and says she's being harassed. Later that evening, Tyler's body is found, her head bashed in, leaving Gabe's childhood friends suspects in the murder. With the help of her sister-in-law, Benni attempts to identify the killer and, in the process, learns more about the pasts of her husband and his friends than she's sure she wants to know. Complicating matters further and adding comic relief to this grim tale are periodic calls from her family as they work their way across the country. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Food Gift Love: More than 100 Recipes to Make, Wrap, and Share</h2><p><b>An exciting, inspiring, and beautiful food-gift guide for crafty cooks and food-DIY fans</b><br><br> In <i>Food Gift Love,</i> Maggie Battista, a food-gift guru and rising star of the blog world, celebrates her expertise in and enthusiasm for small-batch, hand-crafted foods.

The book is in two parts; the first part enumerates and details the Fourteen Rules for Group Initiation. These are the rules for disciples and initiates, paralleling on a higher turn of the spiral, the rules for applicants contained in the book "Initiation, Human and Solar". The second part of this volume is concerned with the Rays and the Initiations, those nine major expansions of consciousness through which the initiate becomes progressively liberated from the various forms of our planetary life, ultimately proceeding upon his chosen Path of development and service within the universe. </p><p> <br>One of the outstanding principles unfolded through the pages of this book is that of the growth of the group idea--group service, group responsibility and group initiation. The possibility of group initiation seems to be one of the new emerging developments of the Aquarian era; therefore, the profound value to the disciple of the Fourteen Rules for Group Initiation. These rules embody great truths in symbolic form, into which the consciousness expands with the acceptance of occult obedience, and the meeting of all requirements on the Path of Initiation in a group penetrating together towards the centre of an ashram, and into the heart and will of the presiding Master. </p><p> <br>Because "the way to the innermost sanctum is the way of outer service and because initiation is the effect of an increasing capacity to intuit the Plan, to register ashramic purpose and to act accordingly, "these rules are in reality great Formulas of Approach . . . approach to a specific section of the Path and not approach to the Initiator. I would have you reflect on this distinction. The initiate is becoming increasingly aware of the dynamics of the Science of the Service of the Plan. This distinctive realisation can only come when his fused and blended personality and soul expression of will has disappeared in the blazing light of the Divine Purpose." </p><p><br>Much of this teaching, while beyond the grasp of the average student today, is invaluable in expanding the mind to contemplate the larger patterns and processes in which the individual function may be viewed in perspective. In dealing with such abstruse matters, the author again demonstrates a marvelous capacity to relate the deepest and most profound aspects of the Master's teaching to the life and the consciousness of the aspirant in the world today. Since there is no separation in life, and since the aphorism "As above so below" applies in every particular throughout the cosmos, and recognisably within the solar and the planetary lives, there is great value in the clear delineation of continuity. </p><p> <br>"Revelation concerns Oneness and nothing else. The practical nature of this truth is only recognised when the disciple attempts to do two things: To realise it individually and to bring the nature of planetary unity and of non-separateness to the minds and into the lives of men everywhere." </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching for the present and the immediate future.</p><h2>The Bad Shepherds: The Dark Years in Which the Faithful Thrived While Bishops Did the Devil&#39;s Work</h2><p><p>Shocked to find corruption widespread in the ranks of their shepherds today, too many good Catholics are tempted to leave the Church, unaware that ever since the days when Jesus own treasurer, Judas Iscariot, had his hand in the till, the Good Shepherd and His faithful followers have regularly been betrayed by bad shepherds.</p><p>In these eye-opening pages, Church historian Rod Bennett introduces a number of those bad shepherds, including Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, who regularly sold out the Church to the Roman emperor; Pope Stephen VII, who so hated his late predecessor that he had him dug up, put on trial, and flung into the Tiber; Benedict IX, who bought and sold the papacy (twice!); and Pope John XII, whose debauchery rivaled that of the corrupt emperor Caligula.</p> <p>Those were very bad shepherds indeed, but while they did the Devil s work, good Catholics not only survived they thrived. They outlasted their bad shepherds, preserved in their ranks the Faith of our fathers, and served in each instance as the foundation for a cleansing of the House of God and a vigorous renewal of the Faith.</p><p>These enlightening pages demonstrate that it can happen again!</p></p><p>Rod Bennett was the editor of Wonder Magazine. His writings have appeared in other national publications as well, ranging from Rutherford and Gadfly to Catholic Exchange and Our Sunday Visitor. His first book, &#34;Four Witnessess; The Early Church in Her Own Words,&#34; is a best seller from Ignatius Press. His first novel, &#34;The Christus Eperiment&#34; was published in November 2012.</p><h2>Guiltless Living</h2><p>Through captivating stories, edgy humor, and shocking confessions, Ginger Hubbard drops the act and gets real in this brutally honest look at the seldom admitted, rarely talked about sins of the heart.

Michael Howell has kept his family&#x2019;s Middle Eastern business enterprises going through a decade of takeovers, war, and revolution, thanks in part to his office manager, Teresa, who is also his mistress. One late night at the office, they discover men working overtime&#x2014;producing unauthorized bombs for the Palestine Action Force. Worse, this guerrilla terrorist group is not deterred by their discovery&#x2014;rather, they will enlist Howell and Teresa&#x2019;s unwilling help in carrying out their plan.</p><p>Eric Ambler was born in London in 1909. Before turning to writing full-time, he worked at an engineering firm, and wrote copy for an advertising agency. His first novel was published in 1936. During the course of his career, Ambler was awarded two Gold Daggers, a Silver Dagger, and a Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain, named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers Association of America, and made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. In addition to his novels, Ambler wrote a number of screenplays, including <i>A Night to Remember</i> and <i>The Cruel Sea</i>, which won him an Oscar nomination. Eric Ambler died in 1998.<b>Lewis Prescott<br><br>May 14</b><br><br>This is Michael Howell&#x2019;s story and he tells most of it himself. I think that he should have told all of it.<br><br>He may not be the most persuasive of advocates in his own cause, and, as the central figure in what has come to be known as The Green Circle Incident, he is very much the defendant; but he alone can answer the charges and give the necessary explanations. It is upon his own words that he will be judged. In his sort of predicament declarations of sympathy and understanding from outsiders are apt to sound like pleas in mitigation. Instead of strengthening his case, my contributions could very well weaken it. I told him so.<br><br>He, however, did not agree.<br><br>&#x201c;Supporting evidence, Mr. Prescott,&#x201d; he said earnestly; &#x201c;that&#x2019;s what I need from you. Tell them what you know about Ghaled. Give it to them thick and strong. I can tell them what happened to me, but they have to understand what I was up against. They&#x2019;ll believe you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My opinion of a man like Ghaled formed in the course of a single interview isn&#x2019;t evidence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It will have the weight of evidence. I don&#x2019;t expect you openly to side with me, Mr. Prescott&#x2014;�that would be asking too much&#x2014;�but don&#x2019;t, I beg you, play into the hands of my enemies.&#x201d;<br><br>Fruity and false; this was the Levanter speaking. I gave him a bleak look.<br><br>&#x201c;I am not playing into anybody&#x2019;s hands, Mr. Howell, least of all your enemies. I would have thought I had made that sufficiently clear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To me, yes.&#x201d; He held up a finger. &#x201c;But what about the public and the news media? How can I vindicate myself, and the Agence Howell, when important independent witnesses, those who know the truth, choose to remain silent?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wrote a three-�thousand-�word feature on the subject, Mr. Howell,&#x201d; I reminded him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t call that remaining silent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With respect, Mr. Prescott, your Green Circle article gave only a smattering of the truth.&#x201d; He began wagging the raised finger at me. &#x201c;If I am to be believed, I must tell it all. In that telling I need your help. I ask you to stand up with me and be counted.&#x201d;<br><br>I paused before replying: &#x201c;You may find yourself wishing that I had remained seated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am prepared to take that risk. What we have to do between us, Mr. Prescott, is to tell the whole truth. That is all, the whole truth.&#x201d;<br><br>He made the telling of the whole truth sound very simple. He may even have believed that, in his case, it was.<br><br>For the record: at the time of which I am now writing I had neither met Mr. Howell nor even heard of his existence.<br><br>As a senior foreign correspondent working for the Post-� Tribune syndicated news service, I am based in Paris. Two months prior to the Incident I had been assigned temporarily to the Middle-�East to cover the visit of a U.S. Secretary of State making yet another attempt to resolve the Arab-�Israeli conflict. The tour had ended in Beirut and it had been there that I had encountered Melanie Hammad.<br><br>My wife and I had met her originally in Paris at the apartment of mutual friends. Knowing her to be a freelance contributor to French and American fashion magazines, I had been surprised to find her sitting next to me at a Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs press conference.<br><br>&#x201c;A little off your usual beat, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I asked after we had exchanged greetings.<br><br>She raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;This is my home. Didn&#x2019;t you know that I was an Arab?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew that you were from the Lebanon.&#x201d;<br><br>In Paris she had been an attractive young woman with sultry eyes who dressed well, spoke several languages and knew the high-�fashion people. She had been helpful to my wife in the matter of getting special discounts on perfume, I remembered.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said firmly, &#x201c;I am an Arab first and a Lebanese second.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Muslim or Christian?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My parents are Maronite Christian, so I suppose I am too.&#x201d; She lowered her voice to a whisper. &#x201c;At present I am observing for the Palestinian Action Force.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; I assumed that she was joking and added with a smile: &#x201c;Unofficially, I take it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could scarcely do so officially.&#x201d; She did not return the smile. &#x201c;We could talk about it later if you wish.&#x201d; Her fine eyes became intense. &#x201c;I think you might be interested, Mr. Prescott.&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. She seemed to be serious; but the only Palestinian Action Force I knew of was a splinter guerilla group led by a man named Salah Ghaled with a gangster reputation. It was difficult to think of the elegant Miss Hammad as in any way connected with him. Still, I was intrigued.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the St Georges. If you&#x2019;re free we might have lunch.&#x201d;<br><br>The syndicate&#x2019;s Middle East bureau has an office in Beirut. The man in charge is an Englishman named Frank Edwards who also acts as a stringer for one or two British news�papers. Before meeting Miss Hammad for lunch I made some inquiries.<br><br>Edwards laughed. &#x201c;So, our Melanie&#x2019;s picked on you, has she? I thought she was after the New York Times man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s press agent for the Palestinian Action Force.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But my wife and I know her. She&#x2019;s one of the Paris fashion girls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In Paris she may be a fashion girl, but in this part of the world she&#x2019;s a Palestinian activist. Ghaled recruited her when she was a student at the Sorbonne and he was still with El Fatah. Her old man&#x2019;s rich, of course, or the police would be leaning on her. He owns that new office building you can see from the St Georges and a few more like it as well. She doesn&#x2019;t have to work for a living, and, anyway, where Ghaled is concerned it&#x2019;s love. We&#x2019;ve got loads of stuff on them both. Do you want me to get it out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll see what sort of a pitch she makes first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can tell you that now. Extremism in the pursuit of liberty is no vice. Moderation is another name for weakness. I&#x2019;m told that she can be very persuasive. You get handed an expurgated version of the PAF manifesto and, to warm the cockles of your heart, a mimeographed copy of the &#x2018;Thoughts of Salah Ghaled.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She could have given me that in Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There you weren&#x2019;t writing about the Middle East.&#x201d;<br><br>However, in one thing Edwards had been mistaken. Melanie Hammad had more to offer than pamphlets.<br><br>&#x201c;You have,&#x201d; she informed me, &#x201c;a reputation for being truly objective and independent, of not accepting uncritically a consensus of opinion, even when it would be prudent to do so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very flattering, Miss Hammad, but I hope you&#x2019;re not suggesting that I am in any way unique.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not so stupid. There are other Americans like you, of course. But they are not often here, and when they are, they have no time to listen. I know what is said about the Palestinian Action Force. It is said that they are criminals using the Palestinian cause for their own ends, that Salah Ghaled deserted El Fatah when they were under attack, that he is no fighter for freedom but a mere gangster. You may be inclined to believe these things. You will at least have taken note of them. But you may also question and wonder if this received view, this consensus may be wrong. Given the chance, I think that you would prefer to form your own opinion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But since nobody has asked me to form an opinion about Mr. Ghaled and his Palestinian Action Force . . .&#x201d; I left the rest of the sentence in the air.<br><br>&#x201c;I am asking you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unfortunately you are not my New York editor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have wide discretion. Your wife told me so. I am speaking of an important personal interview by you, Lewis Prescott. It would be exclusive, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought for a moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Where would this exclusive interview take place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here in Lebanon. In secret naturally. Great discretion would have to be observed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When would it take place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you agree today, I think I can arrange it within twenty-�four hours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does Mr. Ghaled speak English or French?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not well. I would be the interpreter. You have only to say the word, Mr. Prescott.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see. Well, I&#x2019;ll let you know later today.&#x201d;<br><br>Edwards whistled when I told him of the proposal. &#x201c;So Ghaled wants to come out of the woodwork!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has he been interviewed much before? Hammad mentioned that she had done pieces on him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was when he was an El Fatah man. Since he started the PAF caper he&#x2019;s been underground most of the time. The Jordanians put a price on his head and the PLO people in Cairo tried to persuade the Syrians to crack down on him. The Syrians wouldn&#x2019;t quite go along with them on that, but he&#x2019;s had to keep his nose clean there and be careful. Though he&#x2019;s based in Syria he never sends his goon squads into action on Syrian territory. He&#x2019;s poison here, of course. He could use an improved image, a little respectability.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Frank, you&#x2019;re not suggesting, I hope, that, to please pretty Miss Melanie Hammad, I&#x2019;d do a clean-�up job on him.&#x201d;<br><br>Edwards held his hands up defensively. &#x201c;No, Lew, but I am reminding you that a personal interview of the kind you do tends to become a profile of the institution with which the person interviewed is generally identified. If you were to do a job like that in this case you&#x2019;d be giving Ghaled a lift, the sort of international identity that he doesn&#x2019;t at present have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I were out to do a piece on the Palestinian guerilla movement, which I am not, would I choose Ghaled as representative of it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Representative?&#x201d; He looked blank for a moment, then shrugged. &#x201c;There are ten separate Palestinian guerilla movements, more if you include groups like the PAF. You might do worse than choose Ghaled. He&#x2019;s been in one or other of the movements since he was a boy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he a maverick, though, a far-�out fanatic?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all far-�out fanatics. By hatred out of illusion, the lot of them. They have to be. They couldn&#x2019;t have survived otherwise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No moderates at all? What about Yassir Arafat?&#x201d;</p><h2>Mei Hashiloach: A Hebrew-English Translation of the Hasidic Commentary on the Torah by the Ishbitzer Rebbe</h2><p>Even before its original publication in 1860, the Mei HaShiloach was attacked by Hasidic groups in Poland; attempts were even made to sabotage the press on which it was being printed. Izbicy is sometimes referred to as 'New Age Hasidism', a tribute to its radical modernity. Rabbi Mordechai Yosef stressed personal responsibility in attaining true spiritual growth and self-knowledge. Throughout the Mei HaShiloach one finds strong currents compelling us to focus on our selfhood, individuation, truth, identity, and transcendence, and inviting us to re-examine our sin, failure, and despair in the light of his unique and radical philosophy. In his reading of the personalities in the Biblical narratives, the Izbicy explores their choices, doubts, and compulsions in a way that seems startling modern, and was extraordinary for its time - and even for ours. He devoted uncommon attention to emotions, human relationships, and intimacy.Rabbi Worch&#x2019;s meticulously annotated translation opens up all the nuances of Rabbi Mordechai Yosef&#x2019;s elusive world, providing full access to his weltanschauung. This translation empowers the reader to enter the Mei HaShiloach on its many different levels - intellectual, emotional, and psychological.</p><p></p><h2>Star Wars: Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Captain Phasma</h2><p>What happened to Captain Phasma after <i>Star Wars</i> Episode VII: The Force Awakens?

His tragic suicide in 2013 at the age of twenty-six after being aggressively prosecuted for copyright infringement shocked the nation and the world.<br> <br>Here for the first time in print is revealed the quintessential Aaron Swartz: besides being a technical genius and a passionate activist, he was also an insightful, compelling, and cutting essayist. With a technical understanding of the Internet and of intellectual property law surpassing that of many seasoned professionals, he wrote thoughtfully and humorously about intellectual property, copyright, and the architecture of the Internet. He wrote as well about unexpected topics such as pop culture, politics both electoral and idealistic, dieting, and lifehacking. Including three in-depth and previously unpublished essays about education, governance, and cities,<i>The Boy Who Could Change the World</i> contains the life&#x2019;s work of one of the most original minds of our time.<br></p><p>Aaron Swartz (1986-2013) was involved in the development of RSS, Creative Commons, web.py, and Reddit.

With each step, the landscape he traversed became richer, suggesting deeper and deeper aspects of astronomy, history, biology, and literature, and making the path universal in scope. His insights inspire us to turn out local paths-- whether through cities, suburbs, or rural areas-- into portals to greater understanding of our interconnectedness with nature and history.</p></p><p><p>For nearly forty years, Chet Raymo has walked a one-mile path from his house in North Easton, Massachusetts, to the Stonehill College campus where he has taught physics and astronomy. The woods, meadows, and stream he passes are as familiar to him as his own backyard, yet each day he finds something new. "Every pebble and wildflower has a story to tell," Raymo says.</p><p>In <i>The Path</i>, Raymo chronicles the universe he has found by closely observing every detail of his route. He connects the local to the global, the microscopic to the galactic, with a scientists's curiosity, a historian's respect for the past, a child's capacity for wonder. With each step, the landscape he traverses becomes richer and more multidimensional, opening door after door into astromnomy, geology, biology, history, and literaure.</p><p>"The flake of granite in the path was once at the core of towering mountains pushed up across New England when continents collided," he writes. "The purple loosestrife beside the stream emigrated from Europe in the 1800s as a garden ornamental, then went wantonly native in a land of wild frontiers. The light from the star Arcturus I see reflected in the brook beneath the bridge at night has been traveling across space for forty years before entering my eye. I have attended to all of these stories and tried to hear what the landscape has to say .... I have attended, too, to language. How did the wood anemone and Sheep Pasture get their names? What does the <i>queset</i> of Queset Brook signify in the language of Native Americans? Scratch a name in a landscape, and history bubbles up like a spring."</p><p>The path also reveals the stories of nineteenth-century industrialists who transformed natural resources into power, and turn-of-the-century landscape architects, such as Frederick Law Olmsted, who championed an ideal of nature tamed by conscious intent. In its transformations over the centuries, Raymo writes, the path "encapsulates in many surprising ways the history of our nation and of our fickle love affair with the natural world."</p><p>Recognizing that his path is commonplace, and that we all have such routes in our lives, Raymo urges us to walk attentively, stopping often to watch and listen with care. His wisdom and insights inspire us to turn local paths-- whether through cities, suburbs, or rural areas-- into doorways to greater understanding of nature and history.</p><p><b>Chet Raymo</b> is the noted author of <i>An Intimate Look at the Night Sky</i>, <i>Skeptics and True Believers</i>, <i>Natural Prayers</i>, and <i>365 Starry Nights</i>.

Though it was designed to check tyrants, Thomas Jefferson also called impeachment &#x201c;the most formidable weapon for the purpose of a dominant faction that was ever contrived.&#x201d; On the one hand, it nullifies the will of voters, the basic foundation of all representative democracies. On the other, its absence from the Constitution would leave the country vulnerable to despotic leadership. It is rarely used, and with good reason.<br><br> Only three times has a president&#x2019;s conduct led to such political disarray as to warrant his potential removal from office, transforming a political crisis into a constitutional one. None has yet succeeded. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for failing to kowtow to congressional leaders&#x2014;and, in a large sense, for failing to be Abraham Lincoln&#x2014;yet survived his Senate trial. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against him for lying, obstructing justice, and employing his executive power for personal and political gain. Bill Clinton had an affair with a White House intern, but in 1999 he faced trial in the Senate less for that prurient act than for lying under oath about it.<br><br> In the first book to consider these three presidents alone&#x2014;and the one thing they have in common&#x2014;Jeffrey A. Engel, Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali, and Peter Baker explain that the basis and process of impeachment is more political than legal. The Constitution states that the president &#x201c;shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,&#x201d; leaving room for historical precedent and the temperament of the time to weigh heavily on each case. This book reveals the complicated motives behind each impeachment&#x2014;never entirely limited to the question of a president&#x2019;s guilt&#x2014;and the risks to all sides. Each case depended on factors beyond the president&#x2019;s behavior: his relationship with Congress, the polarization of the moment, and the power and resilience of the office itself. This is a realist view of impeachment that looks to history for clues about its potential use in the future.</p><p><b>Jeffrey A.

Engel<br><br>Their government was failing by 1787, which hadn&#x2019;t taken long. A mere decade after declaring independence, and only four years after winning a bloody Revolution fought to prove that point, Americans found the Articles of Confederation that bound the states together wholly inadequate. Designed during the war by representatives of thirteen independent states who longed to stay that way as much as possible, it denied federal officials the ability to effectively regulate the new nation&#x2019;s trade, orchestrate a unified foreign policy, or even maintain basic civil order. State power ruled instead of federal control, and it proved incapable of coping with a steady barrage of economic blows, diplomatic insults, and widespread popular unrest. <br><br>&#x201c;Our situation is becoming every day more and more critical,&#x201d; James Madison lamented in early 1787. Frustrated by representing Virginia in a federal congress powerless to change the nation&#x2019;s course, he found &#x201c;thoughtful observers unanimously agree that the existing confederacy is tottering to its foundation.&#x201d; Calls for disunion multiplied, with &#x201c;many individuals of weight&#x201d; increasingly &#x201c;leaning towards monarchy&#x201d; for salvation.<br><br>Monarchy was what the thirteen colonies had rebelled against in the first place only a decade before&#x2014;a tyrannical monarchy that had threatened their liberties, but at least had been able to provide order, which seemed increasingly appealing as an alternative to their current woes. Madison worried, as their problems grew&#x2014;with seemingly little their government could do in response&#x2014;that Americans were &#x201c;losing all confidence in our political system&#x201d; which &#x201c;neither has nor deserves advocates.&#x201d;1<br><br>They could, at least, attempt something better, which is why delegates gathered in Philadelphia throughout the summer of 1787 in hope of repairing their fatally flawed constitution. If they failed to find a better way, or even a replacement powerful enough to tackle the nation&#x2019;s problems yet constrained enough to ensure liberty&#x2019;s survival, the United States would likely become little more than a footnote in history.<br><br>Therein lay the real problem, and the reason the Articles had constrained federal power in the first place. Power was dangerous. Americans in this era widely agreed it poisoned any who wielded it with an insatiable desire for more, its steady accumulation engendering corruption and injustice. Freed from Britain&#x2019;s powerful grip, they&#x2019;d tried doing without a strong federal government of their own, and in particular without a national executive empowered to keep the peace and enforce the nation&#x2019;s laws, but soon found they couldn&#x2019;t live without either. What form of government could therefore be trusted with the power it required, without simultaneously employing that power to undermine liberty? More specifically, in whose hands could such power possibly be trusted?<br><br>The question defined their entire epoch. &#x201c;Show me that age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of their rulers being good men without a consequent loss of liberty,&#x201d; Virginia&#x2019;s famed orator Patrick Henry subsequently challenged when the Constitutional Convention delegates were done forging a new government. &#x201c;I say that the loss of that dearest privilege has ever followed, with absolute certainty, every such mad attempt.&#x201d; Their proposed salvation might ultimately prove their undoing, he charged. The new constitution forged in Philadelphia &#x201c;winked towards monarchy,&#x201d; with a presidency and legislature empowered not so much to ensure popular freedom and prosperity as to guarantee their own.2<br><br>Henry was right, at least about one thing: It had never worked before. The new American republic lived in a world of monarchies, and no republic in history had ever been attempted over such a wide expanse and vast citizenry. Neither had any managed to retain the liberties proclaimed at its birth, as the virtuous rulers chosen to safeguard their people&#x2019;s security instead came to value their pocketbooks and powers more. Rome had fallen in this way. So, too, Athens and every other example from the classical age that the delegates to the 1787 convention studied, finding to their dismay that even the most virtuous republic proved vulnerable to this same unavoidable flaw. <br><br>&#x201c;There is scarce a king in a hundred who would not, if he could, follow the example of Pharaoh,&#x201d; Pennsylvania&#x2019;s scientist and statesman Benjamin Franklin reminded his fellow delegates. &#x201c;Get first all the people&#x2019;s money, then all their lands, and then make them and their children servants forever.&#x201d; This was simply the natural order of things. &#x201c;It will be said, that we don&#x2019;t propose to establish Kings&#x201d; in our new government, he continued. Yet &#x201c;I am apprehensive,&#x201d; indeed &#x201c;perhaps too apprehensive, that the Government of the States, may in future times, end in a Monarchy.&#x201d;3 Franklin&#x2019;s was no isolated fear, which extended well beyond a simplistic if ominous fear of one day living under a new American king. Leaders charged with protecting liberty, the founders believed, might one day prove its demise.<br><br>That last sentence should hurt your eyes, or at least make them roll. Sweeping assertions about the unified beliefs of the nation&#x2019;s &#x201c;framers&#x201d; or &#x201c;founders&#x201d;&#x2014;or, worse yet, &#x201c;founding fathers&#x201d;&#x2014;are almost invariably misleading. Most fail to appreciate the generation&#x2019;s diversity and divisiveness out of ignorance. Others intentionally obscure those qualities to bolster some faulty contemporary argument. Reality was more complex. The ranks of those who contributed to the American Revolution and the independent country that followed included merchants and landowners, politicians and preachers, slave owners and those appalled by the practice, each part of a national palette so vast that few residents could reliably claim to have visited its wide expanse or even met someone from each of its thirteen states. <br><br>The Revolution&#x2019;s length further complicates broad assessments of its participants. Nearly a decade separated Britain&#x2019;s despised 1765 Stamp Act and the new taxes it imposed on its North American colonies from the 1773 Boston Tea Party those policies ultimately inspired. More than a decade, in turn, passed between the latter and the nation&#x2019;s first presidential inauguration. Indeed, the entire period&#x2019;s two signature events&#x2014;literally so, as each produced documents whose endorsements were, in the moment, as important as their text&#x2014;occurred eleven years apart, and the men who debated the radical and revolutionary Declaration of Independence in 1776 were far different in temperament and experience than those who composed the much more conservative 1787 Constitution. Only six signed both, a mere 5 percent of total participants, though they, too, had been changed by the intervening years of bloodshed, anxiety, loss, and triumph.<br><br>The collective variety and extended chronology of those who revolted and those who constructed makes for colorful history, but it muddies the average citizen&#x2019;s ability to discern the era&#x2019;s applicability for their own lives. Specifically, the founding generation&#x2019;s ideological and political diversity, coupled with the self-evident differences between the eighteenth and the twenty-first centuries, makes any contemporary understanding of the Constitution&#x2019;s binding language difficult at best. This is more than mere inconvenience or academic concern. The Declaration is inspiring, but the Constitution&#x2019;s specific wording&#x2014;the result both of political compromise over issues specific to the era, as well as severe editing&#x2014;continues to guide our politics today. <br><br>We may choose, as a matter of legal philosophy or political practicality, to employ the text for broad guidance as we rethink and relitigate new and old problems alike. That is the unassailable right of every ensuing generation, who in the words of retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy can &#x201c;invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.&#x201d; Others may care only for its words as originally intended. &#x201c;The Constitution, as you know, contains a number of broad provisions, which are necessarily vague in their application,&#x201d; Kennedy&#x2019;s court colleague Antonin Scalia countered. &#x201c;Originalism gives to those terms the meaning they were understood to have when the people adopted them.4<br><br>No matter one&#x2019;s preferred methodology for interpreting the Constitution, whether celebrated as a living document or venerated as what Scalia called &#x201c;the good old dead Constitution,&#x201d; we should at least offer its authors the respect of asking why they wrote and thought what they did. This is especially important when putting their eighteenth-century words and thinking into contemporary effect, pondering in the context of this book meaningful yet potentially debatable terms such as &#x201c;treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors.&#x201d; To understand the history of presidential impeachments, we must start with both the office and that process as its designers initially conceived them.5<br><br>The presidency did not arise by accident. Delegates to the federal convention met for months behind closed doors, shuttered and sealed to immunize their debates from public pressure, hammering out a government with overlapping spheres of power. None might grow too large or powerful, they reasoned, if coequal legislative, judicial, and executive branches were aligned against one another. Lawmakers could see their legislation vetoed by an executive who considered their work unwise, for example; judges could invalidate legislators&#x2019; statutes or a president&#x2019;s actions if counter to the Constitution&#x2019;s prescripts; and presidents required Congress&#x2019;s approval before spending a dime or concluding treaties with foreign lands. Because none held unlimited power, the Constitution&#x2019;s framers reasoned, none would be able to attain it at the expense of the others.<br><br>Then they added one more additional restraint on the executive, the branch most like the monarch they&#x2019;d just rejected but whose stability and authority they nonetheless desired, inserting into their new constitution a means of ejecting any president who threatened to employ the powers at his disposal to harm the general welfare or to profit too greatly at its expense.6 A president could be impeached, though even this was not wholly enough to alleviate their ingrained fear of concentrated executive power. One thing did. Or rather, one man did. Indeed, the entire convention would likely not have succeeded but for him.7<br><br>Which leads back to one of those few things this complex generation overwhelmingly agreed upon: George Washington would be first. Consequently the best way to understand what they collectively envisioned a president should be is to consider the degree of duty and sacrifice that made him their unanimous ideal. Conversely, when asking what sort of president might warrant impeachment, a useful first step is to envision one wholly lacking these critical virtues. <br><br>The Constitution&#x2019;s framers never expected subsequent presidents would replicate George Washington precisely. They were not fools, nor deluded into thinking him flawless or beyond reproach. Many in the room had personally seen him stumble, lose his temper, or choose the wrong course. Yet none had ever seen him put his own needs above the nation&#x2019;s. Consequently, any future chief executive who demonstrated the opposite&#x2014;placing personal aggrandizement or malfeasance above their sense of duty to the people at large, perhaps even damaging the republic&#x2019;s future in the process&#x2014;would be so unlike the president they envisioned as to warrant removal and dishonor. When considering what the Constitution&#x2019;s authors thought about which acts or defects might warrant a president&#x2019;s impeachment, therefore, one shorthand explanation can be found in asking what would George Washington not have done?8<br>The United States were, in truth, more coalition than country by the mid-1780s. Independence had brought peace but neither stability nor prosperity, especially as victory eliminated the one thing that truly bound the thirteen together. Without a common foe, they instead acted more like sovereign countries than as parts of a broader whole, providing ample hope in European capitals that the new American union might yet break apart. Washington feared as much. Long an unwavering advocate of a strong national government after eight years in command of the Continental army, he worried as the war ended in 1783 that Americans were destined in its absence to become little more than &#x201c;the sport of European politics.&#x201d;9<br><br>Time seemed to prove him right, and with remarkable speed. British forts and colonies lined the borders to the north and northwest as the 1780s progressed, as did potentially hostile and certainly wary Indian nations. Britain&#x2019;s peerless fleet meanwhile controlled the Atlantic to the east and the Caribbean to the south. Spain dominated the continent&#x2019;s central arteries, strategically positioned to make good on its repeated threats to curtail American access to the critical Mississippi River, New Orleans, and the markets beyond. Denied easy access to Britain&#x2019;s markets at war&#x2019;s end, or confidence in the long-term availability of new customers and goods, all the while rebuilding from the war itself, American per capita production and earnings by mid-decade fell to merely half what they had been before the war, resulting in what some experts consider the nation&#x2019;s worst economic crisis until the Great Depression a century and a half later.<br><br>&#x201c;Our commerce is almost ruined,&#x201d; a Massachusetts congressman lamented, and the country&#x2019;s weak federal government seemed incapable of altering their course. Federal currency was untrusted and frequently unaccepted, its value varying from state to state and questioned abroad, leaving central authorities unable to repay hefty wartime debts. To accomplish anything under the Articles required consent from three-fourths of the state delegations to Congress present for any vote, something impractical in the best of circumstances yet largely impossible, given that spotty attendance typically made even fielding a quorum difficult enough. Recalcitrant (and frequently absent) Rhode Island rejected every effort to retire the federal debt; as the smallest state it was wholly uninterested in sharing the load with its larger brethren. Georgia habitually and politely voted yes, then refused to pay. Others simply declined to voice an opinion.10<br><br>This was not unusual. Congressional resolutions were frequently ignored under the Articles. Six requisitions on the states passed Congress between 1781 and 1786. Only a third brought any revenue at all.11 The last netted a mere $663 dollars, less than 2 percent of the total requested.12 &#x201c;No money is paid into the public treasury,&#x201d; Madison lamented, and &#x201c;no respect is paid to the federal authority.&#x201d; Washington fumed from Mount Vernon at the news, and at those who continued to support a federal government too impotent to warrant any concern over its tyrannical possibilities. &#x201c;To be fearful of vesting Congress, constituted as that body is, with ample authorities for national purposes,&#x201d; he lamented to fellow colonial leader John Jay, &#x201c;appears to me the very climax of popular absurdity and madness.&#x201d;13<br><br>The time had come for their union to either draw closer together or d...</p><h2>Ornament of Precious Liberation (Tibetan Classics)</h2><p><b>A welcome new translation of Gampopa's classic overview of the Buddha's teachings.</b><br><br><b>Discover the heart of the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings in this new and beautiful translation of Gampopa&#x2019;s classic guidebook<i>.</i></b><br> <br> <i>Ornament of Precious Liberation </i>is a spiritual and literary treasure of Tibetan Buddhism and of the Kagy� lineage in particular.

His book captures the same joyful spirit that enlivens his seminars. In concise, reader-friendly chapters, best-selling author Steve Chandler delivers over 50 powerful ideas guaranteed to stimulate fantastic sales success. Drawing on his extensive experience in the field, and using the most up-to-date psychological tools available, Chandler illustrates ways for both the novice and the seasoned pro to reach new heights of business prosperity. The Joy of Selling invites readers to be extraordinary, not only in sales but in all areas of life by making a conscious commitment to innovation, adventure, and clear communication.</p><p>Chandler is a prolific author with over 20 books to his credit. He is a professional business coach and corporate trainer whose books have been translated into over 20 languages. His blog, iMindShift, is popular around the world and people can subscribe through his website at stevechandler.com. He lives with his musical wife Kathy who edits his books. A lifelong friend with Terry Hill, he enjoys creating TWO GUYS books out of their correspondence."Everyone sells something," says Steve Chandler as he persuades listeners of the value of developing good selling skills no matter what one's position in life. Using quirky stories and a myriad of motivational quotations, he makes the listener eager to try his tactics. His simple, sensible techniques make it easy to envision oneself actually selling products, services, or ideas. Ironically, Chandler reads much of the text in a monotone, but when he allows himself to read with feeling, his voice shines. Overall, his narrative deficiencies do not interfere with his valuable message (except when he attempts female voices). A short, upbeat musical selection at the beginning and end of each CD energizes the material and inspires listeners to believe in their ability to develop strong sales skills.

Brown coolly documents with dramatic subtlety the violent rebellion on the Canadian prairie led by Riel, who some regard a martyr who died in the name of freedom, while others consider him a treacherous murderer.</p></p><p><p><b>CHESTER BROWN</b> is the author of <i>I Never Liked You</i>, <i>The Little Man</i>, <i>The Playboy</i>, and <i>Yummy Fur</i>. He lives in Toronto; he is an illustrator for <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>.</p>Brown's exploration of the life of a [...] 19th-century Canadian revolutionary Riel is a strong contender for the best graphic novel ever. Over five years in the making, Brown's work is completely realized here, from the strikingly designed two-color cover to the cream-colored paper and pristinely clear drawings. The story begins in 1869, with the sale of the independent Red River Settlement area of what's now Canada to the Canadian government. The area is inhabited by the French-speaking Metis, of mixed Indian and white ancestry, who are looked down upon by the Canadians. Riel is bilingual and becomes a de facto leader for the Red River Settlement, demanding the right for them to govern themselves within Canada. Not surprisingly, this request is denied, and the conflict is set in motion that ultimately consumes Riel's life. Brown doesn't deviate from a six-panel grid for the entire book, telling his story in a cartoon realism style reminiscent of <i>Little Orphan Annie</i>. And while the book concerns imperialism, empire, nationalism and the chaos that results, Brown maintains a still, almost silent atmosphere. He brilliantly renders a lengthy courtroom sequence by setting figures against a black background, heightening the tension of the events by employing minimal effects. Even the battle scenes are subdued. All of this will hook readers' minds and eyes, but never tell them what to think or feel. Instead, Brown calmly lets his story unfold, making the reading process deeply affecting. This is an ingenious comic and a major achievement.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Has the suspension of dogmatic certainties and presumptions opened a space in which we can encounter religious wonder anew? Situated at the split between theism and atheism, we now have the opportunity to respond in deeper, freer ways to things we cannot fathom or prove. <br><br>Distinguished philosopher Richard Kearney calls this condition <i>ana-theos</i>, or God after God-a moment of creative "not knowing" that signifies a break with former sureties and invites us to forge new meanings from the most ancient of wisdoms. Anatheism refers to an inaugural event that lies at the heart of every great religion, a wager between hospitality and hostility to the stranger, the other&#x2014;the sense of something "more." By analyzing the roots of our own anatheistic moment, Kearney shows not only how a return to God is possible for those who seek it but also how a more liberating faith can be born. <br><br>Kearney begins by locating a turn toward sacred secularity in contemporary philosophy, focusing on Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Ricoeur. He then marks "epiphanies" in the modernist masterpieces of James Joyce, Marcel Proust, and Virginia Woolf. Kearney concludes with a discussion of the role of theism and atheism in conflict and peace, confronting the distinction between sacramental and sacrificial belief or the God who gives life and the God who takes it away. Accepting that we can never be sure about God, he argues, is the only way to rediscover a hidden holiness in life and to reclaim an everyday divinity.</p><p>God after God <i>ana-theos</i> is a moment of creative "not knowing" signifying a break with former sureties and inviting the forging of new meanings from the most ancient of wisdoms.

Editors Heid E. Erdrich and Laura Tohe have gathered stories from across the nation that celebrate, record, and explore Native American women's roles in community. The result is a rich tapestry that contains work by established writers along with emerging and first-time authors. Contributors include Louise Erdrich, Joy Harjo, Diane Glancy, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, Allison Hedge Coke, LeAnne Howe, Roberta Hill, Kim Blaeser, Linda LeGarde Grover, with a foreword by Winona LaDuke.<br><br>The writings included range from the personal to the political, from notions of romantic love to the realities of marriage, from finding a place in modern society to incorporating tradition in daily life. Whether it's Louise Erdrich's heartbreaking story "The Shawl," Diane Glancy's tightly distilled poems, or Joy Harjo's elegant and fanciful "How to Get to Planet Venus," all of these works explore both what it means to be a woman and how those realities are complicated by the Native American experience.<br><br>The editors have divided these lively and thought-provoking pieces into four sections: "Changing Women," which deals with the stages of a woman's life, awareness of female ancestors, and women's traditions of healing and making art; "Strong Hearts," which shows Indian women enduring with love, defending with fierce judgment, and reaching out across history to protect the people; "New Age Pocahontas," which reveals the humor and complexity of stereotypes and simplified images of Native American women; and "In the Arms of the Skies," which explores the ways in which typical notions about romantic love and marriage are put to the test.<br><br>Sister Nations also includes full biographies of all the contributors, commentary from many of the authors on their work, and a bibliography of relevant publications.</p><p>Laura Tohe was born and raised on the Navajo reservation. Her book No Parole Today received the Poetry of the Year Award from the Wordcraft Circle of Native Writers and Storytellers. She is an associate professor of English at Arizona State University.In this anthology, 49 women share their experiences as Native Americans through poetry, essays, and short fiction. Divided into four sections "Changing Women," "Strong Hearts," "New Age Pocahontas," and "In the Arms of the Skies" the selections focus on the centrality of the Native experience. Writers including Louise Erdrich, Joy Harjo, and Roberta Hill tell of harsh mothers, gentle mothers, drunken fathers, strong fathers, and children growing up in a white world. The range of the collection is represented by the titles "First Woman," "Shadow Sisters," "Piece Quilt: An Autobiography," "Red Hawk Woman," "Grandmother, Salish Mathematician," and "The Frybread Queen," among others. The end material includes brief biographies of each contributor and information about the tribes they represent. These are strong, well-written stories of very real experiences and emotions.

How do they resemble and how do they differ from Jews in other places and times? What have their relationships been to the cultures of their neighbors? To address these and similar questions, some of the finest scholars of our day have contributed their insights to <i>Cultures of the Jews</i>, a winner of the National Jewish Book Award upon its hardcover publication in 2002.<br><br>Constructing their essays around specific cultural artifacts that were created in the period and locale under study, the contributors describe the cultural interactions among different Jews&#x2013;from rabbis and scholars to non-elite groups, including women&#x2013;as well as between Jews and the surrounding non-Jewish world. What they conclude is that although Jews have always had their own autonomous traditions, Jewish identity cannot be considered the fixed product of either ancient ethnic or religious origins. Rather, it has shifted and assumed new forms in response to the cultural environment in which the Jews have lived.<br><br><i>Mediterranean Origins</i>, the first volume in <i>Cultures of the Jews</i>, describes the concept of the &#x201c;People&#x201d; or &#x201c;Nation&#x201d; of Israel that emerges in the Hebrew Bible and the culture of the Israelites in relation to that of neighboring Canaanite groups. It also discusses Jewish cultures in Babylonia, in Palestine during the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods, and in Arabia during the formative years of Islam.</p><p><b>David Biale</b> is the Emanuel Ringelblum Professor of Jewish History at the University of California, Davis.<b> IMAGINING THE BIRTH OF ANCIENT ISRAEL:<br><br>National Metaphors in the Bible<br> </b><br><br>The Bible begins not with the culture of the Hebrews but with the origins of culture as such. The initial concern with the origin of civilization is already evident in the story of the Garden of Eden, where Eve and Adam acquire the first taste of &#x201c;knowledge,&#x201d; but it is only in the account of the bold building of the Tower of Babel, East of Eden, that we get a fuller consideration of human culture.<br><br>Humankind was once one, we are told, and &#x201c;everyone on earth had the same language and the same words&#x201d; (Genesis 11:1). But this era of cultural unity does not last for long. One day the people say to each other &#x201c;Come, let us build us a city, and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scattered all over the world&#x201d; (11:4). In response to this challenge against heaven, God shatters the builders&#x2019; dream of grandeur, confounds their language, and scatters them in all directions. Culture, however, is not destroyed. Rather, it assumes a different form. From now on its distinguishing mark is diversity and dispersion. From now on, its distinct site becomes the nation.<br><br>Of the many nations that &#x201c;branch out&#x201d; in the vast expanses of the earth, Israel is singled out. In the episode following the Tower of Babel, God demands that Abraham leave his birthplace (Ur of the Chaldeans) and go forth (lekh lekha) to the land shown to him. There, God assures him, &#x201c;I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great&#x201d; (Genesis 12:2). Abraham&#x2019;s migration to Canaan offers a new departure. Whereas the sinful homogeneous community of Babel failed, Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, the people God has chosen from a multitude of peoples, seem to hold much promise, destined as they are (unlike the builders of the Tower) to acquire a &#x201c;great name.&#x201d; The primary exile of the first patriarch, his capacity to part from his cultural origins, is construed as an essential rift, a prerequisite for the rise of the nation. Later, in Exodus, the people as a whole will follow a similar route, moving out of Egypt, wandering in the desert, and fashioning the cultural contours of the nation on their way to the Promised Land.<br><br>Dispersion and exile, however, do not lead to clear-cut borders between cultures. Languages intersect in unexpected ways. The very name &#x201c;Babel,&#x201d; which commemorates the primary linguistic splitting, is also a cross-cultural product. Its meaning in Akkadian is presumably &#x201c;the gate to the gods&#x201d; (bab iley), but in the course of the biblical story it is Hebraized via a pun when it is linked to<br><br>the Hebrew root blbl (to confuse). Perhaps this interpretation of &#x201c;Babel&#x201d; is an attempt to mock the pretentious temples of Mesopotamia: the tower that was meant to lead to the gods leads only to confusion.<br><br>But what turns out to be far more confusing is the lack of clear demarcation between the chosen and the non-chosen. As the history of the children of Israel unfolds, we discover that the rebellious quality of primeval culture does not dissipate once we move into the realm of the chosen ones. Quite the contrary: rebellion is one of the salient features of the chosen nation. The Israelites do not venture to construct brick temples whose tops reach heaven, but their idolatrous cravings betray a similar tendency to transgress sacred boundaries.<br><br>The question of national identity&#x2014;the attempt to fathom the entangled relations between Israel and God, between Israel and other nations&#x2014;is one of the most resonant and unresolvable questions in the Bible. In tackling it, the biblical text relies not on philosophical contemplation but rather on narrative. More specifically, it offers a narrative in which the nation is personified extensively. Any attempt to understand the history of the children of Israel, to fashion a conception of national identity, to grasp communal motives and fantasies, collective memories and oblivions, the Bible seems to suggest, requires a plunge into the intricate twists and turns of the individual life.<br><br>The nation&#x2014;particularly in Exodus and Numbers&#x2014;is not an abstract detached concept but rather a grand character with a distinct voice (represented at times in a singular mode) who moans and groans, is euphoric at times, complains frequently, and rebels against Moses and God time and again. Israel has a life story, a biography of sorts. It was conceived in the days of Abraham; its miraculous birth took place with the Exodus, the parting of the Red Sea; then came a long period of childhood and restless adolescence in the wilderness; and finally adulthood was approached with the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>To be sure, a collective character is necessarily more heterogeneous and less predictable. The Pentateuch&#x2019;s account of national formation resists fixed definitions of the various phases in the nation&#x2019;s life cycle. Roughly speaking, chronology is maintained, and yet images of birth, youth, initiation, and suckling intermingle throughout. Thus, the distinct manifestation of national suckling appears only in Numbers 11, where Moses likens the people to a suckling infant in the wilderness, long after the grand-scale initiation at Sinai. But, after all, such boundaries are never that clear in individual biographies either. Infantile dreams may linger on and initiation is rarely exhausted in one rite.<br><br>National literatures were not common in the ancient world. Israel&#x2019;s preoccupation with its reason for being is exceptional in the ancient Near East. In Greece and particularly in Rome, however, narratives concerning national origins are equally important. Israel&#x2019;s history bears resemblance to the Roman one. It too involves a divine promise, individuation from a major civilization, a quest for lost roots, a long journey to what is construed as the land of the forefathers, and a gory conquest. What makes the Bible unique is the extent to which the nation is dramatized. In the Aeneid, by way of comparison, the plot revolves round Aeneas. The wanderings between Troy and the promised new land are primarily Aeneas&#x2019;s wanderings: the people remain a rather pale foil. They engage in no conflict&#x2014;either with Aeneas or the gods&#x2014;that would grant them access to the central stage. The biblical text is significantly different in its rendering of national drama. Israel is a protagonist whose moves and struggles determine the map&#x2014;so much so that 40 years of wanderings in the desert are added to the itinerary as a result of the people&#x2019;s protest against the official preference of Canaan over Egypt.<br><br>The fashioning of Israel as a character is a forceful unifying strategy, but the metaphor does not yield a homogeneous account of national formation. The biblical text reveals points of tension between different traditions regarding the nation&#x2019;s history and character. Even the nation&#x2019;s sexual identity is not stable. Although the Pentateuch shapes a male character, referring to the people as am (singular masculine noun), the Prophets, more often than not, represent Israel as female, using &#x201c;Jerusalem&#x201d; or &#x201c;Zion&#x201d; (feminine nouns) as alternative designations.<br><br>This essay focuses on the intricacies of national imagination in the Pentateuch, and as such it is concerned with the fashioning of a male character who is marked as God&#x2019;s firstborn son. Double personification is at stake&#x2014;of God and the nation&#x2014;creating a familial link between the two. If Rome&#x2019;s sacred origin is assured through the divine blood of its founding fathers&#x2014;Aeneas is Venus&#x2019;s son, and Romulus and Remus are the offspring of Mars&#x2014;in the case of Israel, the nation as a whole, metaphorically speaking, is God&#x2019;s son. On sending Moses to Pharaoh to deliver the people, God proclaims: &#x201c;Israel is My first-born son. I have said to you [Pharaoh], &#x2018;Let My son go&#x2019; &#x201d; (Exodus 4:22&#x2013;23). The priority given to Israel by the Father represents a translation into national terms of the reversal of the primogeniture law&#x2014;a phenomenon so central in the lives of the patriarchs. The late-born nation that came to the stage after all its neighbors had assumed their historical roles is elevated by God to the position of the chosen firstborn.<br><br>Israel is a chosen nation, God&#x2019;s nation, but the reason for its chosen-ness remains obscure. It does not succeed in following traditional norms of male heroism, nor does it become an exemplary nation with high moral and religious standards. The more mature Israel, in the plains of Moab, on the threshold of Canaan, is far more established a community than the nascent nation on the way out of Egypt, but this by no means suggests that biblical historiography relies on the principle of progress. Whereas in the initial stages of the journey the children of Israel worship a Golden Calf in a carnivalesque feast, at the last station, just before crossing the Jordan river, they &#x201c;cling&#x201d; to Baal Peor (under the influence of Moabite women), adopting Canaanite religious practices with much enthusiasm. The Song of Moses, with its synoptic presentation of Israel&#x2019;s history, regards the nation as an ungrateful son whose conduct fails to improve over time: &#x201c;Do you thus requite the Lord, O dull and witless people? Is not He the Father who created you, fashioned you and made you endure!&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 32:6). Instead of appreciating God&#x2019;s vigilance, Moses claims, once the nation &#x201c;grew fat&#x201d; it used its new powers to &#x201c;kick&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 32:15).<br><br>What is most fascinating in the primary biography of ancient Israel is the ambivalence that lies at its very base, an ambivalence that is expressed so poignantly through the intense struggles between the Father (or Moses) and His people. The nation is both the chosen son and the rebel son, and accordingly its relationship with the Father is at once intimate and strained.<br><br>The fictional quality of the struggle between God and the nation does not preclude the historicity of the text. Israel&#x2019;s beginning is situated in historical times&#x2014;in the days of the Exodus&#x2014;rather than in a mythical &#x201c;in illo tempore.&#x201d; Similarly, God defines Himself, at Sinai and elsewhere, as the one who brought Israel out of Egypt&#x2014;not as the Creator of primeval times. Even at moments when the biography of ancient Israel relies on mythical materials&#x2014;primarily, on the myth of the birth of the hero and the myth of the hero&#x2019;s return&#x2014;these are inextricably connected with a historiographical drive to record memorable past events and question their meaning. In the Bible, history and literature go hand in hand, more explicitly than in modern historiography, which is why it serves as a paradigmatic case for the examination of the narrative base of national constructions.<br><br> <b> National Birth</b><br><br>The metaphor of birth is probably the most resonant anthropomorphic image in national narratives from antiquity to modern times. In fact, it is so resonant one tends to forget that nations are not born literally but are, rather, imagined in these terms. Every nation, however, has its own birth story, or birth stories. The book of Exodus provides an intriguingly complex representation of Israel&#x2019;s birth in keeping with the preliminary imaginings of the nation in Genesis. The opening verses of Exodus 1 make clear that God&#x2019;s reiterated promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#x2014;the grand national annunciation scenes of Genesis&#x2014;are finally realized. The descendants of Jacob, whose names are listed solemnly, multiply at an uncanny pace and turn into a &#x201c;mighty&#x201d; nation: the nation of the &#x201c;children of Israel.&#x201d; &#x201c;Israel&#x201d; for the first time is not merely Jacob&#x2019;s second, elevated, name but rather a collective designation of a burgeoning community that &#x201c;fills&#x201d; the land. But then we discover that God&#x2019;s darker prophecy, in the covenant of the parts (Genesis 15:13), is equally fulfilled: Israel is born in a prolonged exile, against Pharaonic bondage.<br><br>Representing the birth of a nation is not a simple task. The imagining of this dramatic event in Exodus is facilitated by the interweaving of two biographies: the story of the birth of Moses, and that of the nation. The fashioning of Israel as character, here as elsewhere, is inseparable from a complementary narrative strategy: the marking of individuals whose histories are paradigmatic. The nation&#x2019;s life story, in other words, is modeled in relation to the biographies of select characters. Abraham, whose departure from Ur serves as prefiguration of the nation&#x2019;s exodus, is only the first exemplary figure. The heterogeneity of national imagination in the Bible depends on a variety of representatives. Fragments of the biographies of Isaac, of Jacob, the eponymous father, and even of Hagar, the Egyptian handmaid, whose affliction foreshadows the nation&#x2019;s enslavement in Egypt, are also linked in different ways to the nation&#x2019;s biography and take part in its construction.<br><br>On the question of birth, Moses&#x2019; story is of special importance. The analogy between the one and the multitude in this case is more immediate. Unlike the patriarchal biographies that pertain to a distant past and flicker over the chasm of time, Moses&#x2019; birth occurs within the same historical setting. Moses is a national leader whose history blends with the history of the nation. He is one of many Hebrew babies persecuted by Pharaoh. His story, however, is marked as the exemplary account that sheds light on the collective birth story as it prefigures the deliverance of the nation as a whole from bondage.<br><br>Moses&#x2019; birth story shares much in common with mythical birth stories. What characterizes the birth of a hero? The conception of the hero is usually impeded by difficulties such as abstinence or prolonged barrenness. During or before pregnancy there is a prophecy, or an oracle cautioning the father against the hero&#x2019;s birth; the father tries to shape a different future and gives orders to kill his new-born son; the babe is then placed in a basket or a box and delivered to the waves. Against all odds, however, the hero is saved by animals, or by lowly people, and is suckled by a female animal or by a humble woman. When full grown, he discovers his royal parents, takes revenge on his father, and, recognized by his people, finally achieves rank and honors.<br><br>Moses&#x2019; story is indeed compatible in many ways with this model: a threatened child, the exposure in the basket, the miraculous deliverance of the foundling, the two sets of parents, and the final acknowledgment of the hero&#x2019;s power. But there is a significant difference: Moses&#x2019; true parents are not the royal ones but rather the poor Hebrew slaves. At a moment of national birth, the inversion of the two sets of parents is not without significance. Moses&#x2019; &#x201c;true&#x201d; parents are higher in rank despite their lowly position precisely because they are members of the chosen nation-to-be.</p><h2>Amos&#39;s Sweater</h2><p>Amos the sheep is old and cold and sick of having his wool taken away.

She did her best to shut out Father Andrew&#x2019;s words during the graveside service. She tried to distract herself by thinking of different ways to solve the high-pressure test problem at the North Sea Valve Company&#x2014;her da&#x2019;s company. Her tactic didn&#x2019;t work. Her emotions threatened to overtake her as the service concluded and the villagers processed down the narrow path from the cemetery. Pippa followed them, focusing on the scenery&#x2014;the familiar rooftops of Gandiegow below, the choppy sea on the horizon, and the crunch of the snow beneath her boots. But all pretense of <i>not feeling</i> fell away once the women made their way into Deydie&#x2019;s cottage. Deydie was the head quilter, the town matriarch, the bossiest woman Pippa had ever known. That&#x2019;s when and where reality sank in.</p><p>Pippa&#x2019;s father, the McDonnell, could end up like Kenneth Campbell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dead.</p><p>She had come home the second week in July, when her father had his accident, and taken his place running the North Sea Valve Company. It was now almost December, and NSV still wasn&#x2019;t standing on its own legs. Neither was her da.</p><p>Each woman pulled out a chair and sat around Deydie&#x2019;s worn dining table, devoid of the sewing machines that had always been there when Pippa was a girl. Now all the machines resided at Quilting Central, where the women gathered regularly. The usual crew was here, the quilters.</p><p>Pippa wasn&#x2019;t one of them, though the older women had tried their damnedest to mold her into a quilter when she was knee-high to a midge. But she was a part of them, shared a commonality with the village women, closer than a lot of blood relations. She just couldn&#x2019;t remember it ever being this quiet in Deydie&#x2019;s cottage.</p><p>Pippa glanced over at Moira, the reason they were all here. Moira was painfully shy, but the pain on her face today had nothing to do with being bashful. Kenneth Campbell, her father, had been laid to rest only an hour ago. Normally, the town would&#x2019;ve gathered to support her at the kirk or at Quilting Central or at her house, but Moira needed only the quilting ladies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and of course, Pippa.</p><p><i>Laid to rest</i> seemed fitting. Pippa sure hoped God would let Kenneth Campbell rest after all this time. The big Scot had spent many years trying to recover from a fishing accident. In pain, miserable, and lingering, but he&#x2019;d never complained. Moira had taken diligent care of him for years, but Kenneth never got better, never overcame.</p><p>The words that Da&#x2019;s doctor had spoken to Pippa only yesterday&#x2014;in hushed tones&#x2014;fell over her again like the quiet enormity that rested around the table now. <i>Your father&#x2019;s not healing as expected. He&#x2019;s not recovering like we&#x2019;d hoped. </i>Pippa&#x2019;s da was everything to her. He had been her whole life. What if his fate was Kenneth&#x2019;s fate? What if his broken bones never mended? What if he was <i>laid to rest </i>in the cemetery as well?</p><p>But Pippa wouldn&#x2019;t sit by and wait to see what would happen next. She stood and paced the floor. Deydie was the only one who seemed to notice her movement. Pippa had always been a woman of action. She would find a way to pay for the private care the doctor suggested. She couldn&#x2019;t stand by and wait until a slot came open for a specialist. Her father needed help now.</p><p>Deydie pushed the teapot closer. &#x201c;Pippa, pour Moira a cup of tea.&#x201d;</p><p>Freda jumped to her feet, too, pulling down mugs from the cabinet. Pippa filled while Freda placed. When tea was poured&#x2014;and ignored&#x2014;Pippa resumed her pacing.</p><p>Bethia, Deydie&#x2019;s oldest friend, grabbed Pippa&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Sit, dear. Please?&#x201d;</p><p>Begrudgingly, Pippa took her chair. Her heart went out to Moira, who&#x2019;d been through the wringer this past month. Her father&#x2019;s decline, her young cousin Glenna coming to live with her as her own parents had perished, and then three days ago, the inevitable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Moira&#x2019;s da died.</p><p>Pippa shouldn&#x2019;t draw parallels, but was Moira&#x2019;s future to be her future, too? Moira had completely withdrawn, shutting out a good number of them, but none so much as Andrew, her beau and Gandiegow&#x2019;s Episcopal priest.</p><p>Cait, Deydie&#x2019;s granddaughter, touched Moira&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Come stay with us tonight at the big house. Mattie can keep Glenna company.&#x201d;</p><p>Moira shook her head <i>no </i>without looking up.</p><p>Cait was dealing with her own loss, two miscarriages. And leaving soon. With a book about her famous husband Graham coming out shortly, they&#x2019;d decided to escape Scotland to avoid the media frenzy. Everyone in the world would learn that this was Graham&#x2019;s hometown.</p><p>Pippa was the opposite of Graham. He&#x2019;d never wanted to leave Gandiegow, while she hadn&#x2019;t been done with school two minutes before taking off and planting herself in Edinburgh. Her plans and dreams had been too big for this village to hold. They still were. But nothing could change how she felt about Gandiegow&#x2019;s people. They were pure gold.</p><p>Cait gazed up at her kindly. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go on home and check on yere da.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d misread Pippa&#x2019;s restlessness.</p><p>Pippa didn&#x2019;t correct her, but took the out. &#x201c;Aye. Da should be ready for his pills.&#x201d;</p><p>Freda jumped up, too, always willing to help. Something Pippa both resented and appreciated. She held up her hand to stop the woman who had been a fixture in Pippa&#x2019;s life forever. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d;</p><p>Pippa laid a hand on Moira&#x2019;s shoulder as she passed by. Too much more and Moira would&#x2019;ve been escaping for home. But no one would be there. Pippa grabbed her coat off Deydie&#x2019;s quilt-laden bed. As she slipped it on, she glanced at the wall, seeing something new.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; Pippa stepped closer, pulling it from a nail.</p><p>&#x201c;What do ye mean?&#x201d; Deydie acted as if she wanted to call her a <i>ninny </i>but seemed to hold her tongue out of respect for Moira and Kenneth. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you ever seen a calendar before?&#x201d;</p><p>Pippa flipped the top page over. It was indeed a calendar, but it featured handsome men dressed in kilts: <i>Men of the Clan.</i> When she realized all the quilters were staring at her, she hung it back in its place. &#x201c;I better get home to take care of my da.&#x201d; But then she wanted to kick herself. Hadn&#x2019;t she heard Moira say that same phrase a hundred times?</p><p>Pippa quickly slipped out the door. The temperature had dropped as the days grew shorter. Her brain, though, barely registered the cold weather.</p><p>A pang of guilt hit her. She had left Gandiegow to escape everyone trying to marry her off. Sure, she&#x2019;d been back to visit, but stayed only as long as the weekend or a bank holiday. But she hadn&#x2019;t been here when the McDonnell had needed her most, when he&#x2019;d almost killed himself doing something incredibly stupid and dangerous. Who in his right mind puts a pallet on a forklift, then a ladder on the pallet, then climbs to the top of the ladder to change a lightbulb? A pigheaded old Scot, who wouldn&#x2019;t dream of asking for help, that&#x2019;s who.</p><p>But guilt and lecturing the McDonnell wasn&#x2019;t going to fix the problem at hand. She needed to find a way to afford private health care. Possibly get Da to the U.S. to see a specialist there. But NSV wasn&#x2019;t making it either. Everything was falling apart. She&#x2019;d have to work on all three problems at once&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Repair NSV&#x2019;s finances, find cash for Da&#x2019;s medical care, and keep everyone from pressuring her into marrying Ross now that she was home.</p><p>Only last year MTech had made an offer for NSV when they&#x2019;d gotten wind of Da&#x2019;s new subsea shutoff valve design. Da told them flat-out <i>no, North Sea Valve is not for sale</i>. But whether her da liked it or not, she&#x2019;d let MTech or any other outside investor come in and she&#x2019;d listen to what they had to say. Scots weren&#x2019;t known for taking charity, but she&#x2019;d entertain the foreigners as long as they brought an infusion of cash to the table&#x2014;and scads of it.</p><p>Her other problem would take some thought. She hoofed it toward home to get Da his painkillers. Later, she&#x2019;d head back to the factory to do paperwork.</p><p>Deydie&#x2019;s calendar flitted through her mind. Maybe she could do something similar. Not a calendar with half-naked men but something to raise money. Women were suckers when it came to a few muscles and a bit of swagger.</p><p>Pippa arrived home to find her father asleep in his wheelchair. She didn&#x2019;t have the heart to wake him, so she laid two painkillers beside his glass of water for when he woke up. As she walked out of the cottage, her eye caught the photo of her mother and father on their first date. Da had bid on her mother at a charity auction at university. Their beaming faces belied the fact that her mother would be gone four years later when Pippa was only a week old.</p><p>She glanced once more down the hallway. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in one hour.&#x201d; There was no one awake to hear her words, but she said it anyway&#x2014;their old habit. Just to reassure herself.</p><p>She walked to the parking lot, thinking of her parents&#x2019; picture and how the auction had brought them together. She drove up and over the bluff to the factory a mile away. Once in her office, she pulled out a pad of engineering paper and began jotting down ideas, as if she were designing a piece of equipment. As she wrote, a grand idea started to take shape.</p><p>Outside her door, the factory floor came alive. She&#x2019;d given everyone the day off for the funeral, but apparently they were as restless as she was&#x2014;needing something to take their minds off losing one of the long-standing members of the community and the nicest man they&#x2019;d ever known.</p><p>Ross and his brother Ramsay stood outside her door. Ross leaned into her office. &#x201c;Can we talk to you a minute?&#x201d;</p><p>She&#x2019;d grown up with these two hulking Scots and considered them like family. Ramsay, the youngest of the Armstrong brothers, wore the same easy smile he&#x2019;d had on his face since marrying the matchmaker Kit Woodhouse, now Armstrong. Ross, on the other hand, didn&#x2019;t look so happy to see Pippa. He shoved his hands in his pockets, looking uncomfortable, things weird between them. She had long been expected to marry Ross, and now that she was home, the pressure was on. He must be feeling it, too. But she refused to think about all that now.</p><p>She joined them outside her office. &#x201c;Can ye both take a look at conveyor three? There&#x2019;s something hanging it up.&#x201d;</p><p>They gazed down at her, expectantly, but it was Ross who spoke up first. &#x201c;We want to know what the doctor had to say yesterday when ye were in Aberdeen. We&#x2019;re worried about the McDonnell.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Hell. </i>Couldn&#x2019;t she have a little more time to process the news herself? &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t want to talk about it.&#x201d;</p><p>More of the workers made their way over and gathered around.</p><p>Ross motioned to the group. &#x201c;We have a right to know.&#x201d;</p><p>Many of the men had invested not only their time into her father&#x2019;s vision, but what little money that they had. Ross included.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not healing.&#x201d; Taog, the factory&#x2019;s ancient machinist, seemed to have read her mind. &#x201c;What a rotten herring. &#x2019;Tis bad enough the McDonnell took a spill.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Twas more than a spill,&#x201d; Murdoch interrupted, running his fingers through his beard. He was the other machinist. He and Taog were always together, and more times than not, were at each other&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;I saw the bone sticking out of his leg meself. Jagged, it was. Och, blood was everywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; Ross commanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, lass.&#x201d; Taog dug in his pocket and produced his wallet. &#x201c;Somehow, we&#x2019;ll get him the medical treatment he needs. We&#x2019;ll pass around a bucket to collect for private care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be enough. We could ask Graham.&#x201d; Ramsay looked embarrassed to have said it.</p><p>&#x201c;Nay. The McDonnell wouldn&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d; Pippa had to do this on her own. &#x201c;No one better bother Graham and Cait. They have enough worries.&#x201d; She pointed at Taog. &#x201c;Grab the notepad off my desk.&#x201d;</p><p>Taog lumbered past her to get it.</p><p>&#x201c;But we want to help.&#x201d; Murdoch nodded his head, his beard bouncing.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you do. And most of ye will.&#x201d; Pippa took the pad from Taog. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s how we&#x2019;re going to raise money.&#x201d; She thanked the Almighty for the clues and ideas that he&#x2019;d dropped in her lap today&#x2014;Deydie&#x2019;s calendar, her father buying her mother at auction, and her engineer&#x2019;s calculating brain. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to call anyone. We have all we need right here.&#x201d; She looked around at the ruggedly handsome men of the village, <i>the single handsome men</i>. She sent up another thank-you for that, too. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have an auction. We&#x2019;re going to sell off our bachelors.&#x201d;</p><p>Ramsay&#x2019;s face uncharacteristically clouded over, a storm coming. &#x201c;And who&#x2019;s going to tell my wife that ye&#x2019;re horning in on her business with this plan of yeres? It won&#x2019;t be me.&#x201d;</p><p>Pippa laughed and it felt good after so much sadness. &#x201c;No worries. It shouldn&#x2019;t interfere with Kit&#x2019;s serious matchmaking. It&#x2019;s just a bit of fun for one evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Ramsay grinned. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m sure you can count on us to assist you with it.&#x201d;</p><p>Pippa looked into the eyes of each single, bonny Scotsman standing there. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;ll all help with the auction?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye, Pippa,&#x201d; they all agreed one by one.</p><p>The whole lot of them were like brothers to her and she could get away with talking to them like a bossy sister. &#x201c;Each of you will be shaved, showered, and kilted. And there better not be the stink of bluidy fish on any one of you. Do ye hear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d&#x2019;ya have in mind?&#x201d; Taog, being an old married man, had nothing to worry about.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the plan,&#x201d; Pippa said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll round up every rich lonely female in Scotland.

The book includes templates, a comprehensive techniques section, guide to embroidery stitches and beautiful hand-drawn illustrations to accompany every project. The projects include mug hugs, hanging decorations, seasonal decorations, pillows, ornaments, wall-organisers, brooches, childrens toys and more.</p><p>Corinne Lapierre developed a passion for crafts and textiles from a very young age, and has always had an avid desire to learn about traditional techniques such as weaving, dyeing, silk painting and embroidery. She studied Fine Art in France before moving to the UK to study Fashion Design in Manchester. After working as a fashion designer for a few years, Corinne studied millinery, through which she discovered felt and its many qualities. In 2009 Corinne started her own craft business as a felt maker and quickly realised there was a demand for craft kits using good quality, natural materials. Her company, based in an old Baptist school in Leeds, UK, sells an expanding range of craft kits and patterns designed for adults and children. Corinne makes regular appearances on Create &amp; Craft TV and lives in Yorkshire with her partner, their three children and two cats.Find 30 little contemporary projects suitable for complete beginners. I think the front cover just about says it all for this book. Colourful, cute, desirable and fun projects. The book is split into chapters: Summer Garden; Spring &amp; Easter; Autumn &amp; Winter and Home &amp; Lifestyle. The techniques section includes the basic techniques needed and the stitches used. Even children could easily master this, under supervision. There isn't anything to dislike. It's full of easy yet stylish projects using bought felt, well photographed and foolproof. There are templates too, some need to be enlarged. * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * Comment For all the projects Lapierre recommends felting material made from a blend of wool/viscose. Apart from supplying yourself with good quality felt, you do not need to equip yourself with much more than a basic sewing kit will provide. Some projects require the use of fusible webbing, plain tissue paper and toy stuffing and it would be enhancing to purchase some special threads, plus beads, buttons etc to make results extra pleasing. The book is suitable for crafters working at all levels. Techniques are shown in close up photography and there are templates at the back of the book. With the exception of just one of two designs the designs geared for children do not include small parts. Conclusion :How lovely that author Corinne Lapierre grew up with a creative Mum who inspired her! I see a lot of craft books but I was really taken aback by the stunning, yet gloriously simplistic layout of this one. I will be very quick to recommend Lapierre and her work in the future, plus the book itself. The felt designs are pretty fabulous so the book lives up to its bold title. This book has been received very well with 100% 5 star reviews on Amazon * Debra Hall -Notcompulsory.blogspot.co.uk * June 2016 We love Corinne Lapierre's style and felt kits she produces and so we're excited to learn that she hasa a second fabulous new book coming out. You'll be glad to hear we weren't disappointed. Corinnehas designed 30 brilliant new scandi-style felt creations that are suitable for both the complete beginner as well as more experienced crafters, Split into four chapters: Summer Garden, Spring &amp; Easter, Autumn &amp; Winter and Home and Lifestyle, there's plenty to choose from yourself, your home and love ones. * Love to Make * Lovely book well written. The projects are clearly explained and easy to make with fabulous photographs to help. All the templates are at the back of the book and easy to use. All the stitches are also clearly explained making the projects a delight to make. Highly recommended. * Jen English * This book is set out well with clear photos showing the different techniques and equipment used to create the projects, exactly what I look for when attempting something new. The templates are clearly labelled and are printed with a thick enough line to accurately trace around. The instructions are comprehensive, easy to understand and along with the photos show exactly how each project should be completed. As felt comes in such wonderful colours, it would be easy to stray from the suggested colours to come up with personalised projects. Experimenting with the template sizes would help get much more out of this book, I'm thinking of enlarging the Woodland Mobile to make bunting for my campervan and shrinking the Lavender Sardines and adding a magnet to each one to make a fishing game! * Sarah Dennis * Fantastic book, very clearly written with excellent photographs. The part showing how to do some of the stitches is great for beginners and those of us who have forgotten how to do some! There are projects for everyone,children would be able to do some of them, or help someone older to do them. there is something for everyone and all seasons in this great book * Donna Hall * Fabulous Felt is a fantastic tutorial book with beautiful full-colour photography throughout. Each page is full of information and written in an simple, easy to understand format. There are thirty patterns included but these can be easily adapted to your own ideas and imagination. She patiently explains how to do each stitch in the project in the first few pages, using excellent photos to show how they are done. I like the fact that it is sectioned into themes, e.g. Summer Garden, Spring and Summer, etc. Every project is easy to find with the contents page at the front. There is an abundance of templates at the back and only a few of them need to be enlarged - always a bonus for me! I particularly like the chicken projects and have the perfect felt ready to do this. Each project has a small section on the side, detailing what templates, tools and material is needed. I really enjoyed looking through this and will definitely be using this book for years to come. 10/10. * Kaiserin Maggs * I received this book as a gift. I'm not the best crafter but my daughter is very much into creating things, so I was hoping it would give me easy to sew projects we would be able to do together. I find the book very clear structured. The projects are very charming, shown with very good photography and small enough for me as a beginner to try out. I was concerned not to manage to follow the instructions but the first few pages help understand terminology and give clear guidance applique and various stitches required. The templates are also very useful. I'm very happy with the book and am looking forward to trying our first project - the butterfly and flower hanging. * Nicole Selley * Fabulous Felt by Corinne Lapierre is a delightful book that will suit beginners and experienced crafters alike. It would make a wonderful gift for beginners to encourage them since the instructions, lists of materials and descriptions of how to make the projects are clear and concise. Patterns are included and there is a lovely range of projects to choose from. More experience crafters could adapt the projects and make them more intricate as desired as a springboard for personal creativity. Instructions include the basic skills needed to embark on the projects from scratch and together with the colour photos make the book very accessible. The projects are so inspiring and some would be suitable for family craft sessions on a wet holiday. The finished projects would be lovely as handmade personal presents if you could bear to part with them or could be given as cutout kits for crafty recipient to make up for themselves. All in all it is a delightful book that would be inspiring to purchase or receive as a present. Thanks to Corinne for the hardworking and inspiration included in it. I already have a project picked out but have also found myself just picking up the book and reading it since it is so charming to browse through too. * Dianne Barnett * This book is colourful and very well set out with makes for both novices and experienced crafters. It ranges from small brooches and decorations to larger cushions and wall hangings. The step by step instructions, patterns and photography are very clear and it is easy for children to follow too. Thirty lovely items to keep you entertained crafting throughout the year. I am now looking forward to the next book by Corinne Lapierre. * Lynn Harris * This beautifully photographed book will appeal to both kids and adults. It's full of gorgeous contemporary scandi/folk style felt projects (30 to be exact) that are suitable for beginners and more advanced crafters. Each project contains details of materials and tools required plus step by instructions that are accompanied by clear photographs or illustrations. The templates at the back of the book are easy to trace and duplicate plus they are mainly true to size with the exception of a few that need to be enlarged 200%. My girls (9,9,10) are all totally smitten with the book and love how quick many of the makes are. They have started to create the most delightful gifts for friends, teachers and themselves and all the time they are slowly learning new stitching techniques that they can apply elsewhere. #ReviewItFriday * Blue Bear Wood * Still working my way through this fabulous book. I'm a totally beginner to felting and have found this book excellent for newbies! The instructions are clear yet concise to follow and the patterns included are fabulous! I've picked out my first project and slowly working my way through- can't wait for it to be finished so I can pick another! * Helen Louise * With 30 projects that are very appealing, it's really nice when it has all the information we need to get started. It gives extra motivation, when everything you need is at your fingers from start to finish. It comes with a step by step guide, amazing and lovely photos, good attention to details and all the templates needed are also provided. Absolutely love it and will definitely recomend it to friends. * Ana Afonso * Fabulous Felt by Corinne Lopierre is a lovely book that gives you inspiration and projects to cover all seasons! There are 10 pages of techniques and stitches so this book is good for anyone new to working with felt. There are a number of projects for Summer, Spring, Autumn and Winter and these include both Easter and Christmas decorations and even Halloween. All the templates needed for the projects are in the back of the book and only a few require photocopying at more than 100% so most can be traced directly from the book. The instructions are clear and there are some lovely photos to help guide you! Overall I'm really pleased with this book! * Gemma Cornish * Wool felt is the medium for the quirky, cute projects in designer Lapierre's debut collection. The book opens with several brief tutorials on stitching and embroidering felt, including information about transferring embroidery patterns from templates and a detailed guide to the basic embroidery stitches used in the projects. This is followed by three seasonally inspired groups of accessories and embellishments, as well as a final "catch-all" chapter featuring a number of nature-and-animal-themed projects. Each project features a list of tools and supplies required (including the amount of felt needed in each color) as well as step-by-step instructions for completing the project with line drawings or photographs of key points. Projects span the small and simple, such as the carefully folded rose brooch, to intricate and complex, such as the owl pillow. Everything is hand-sewn and hand-embroidered, so a sewing machine isn't required. Some basic sewing knowledge is assumed-there's no information about cutting pattern pieces or constructing stuffed toys-but wool felt is a forgiving material and beginners should be able to work their way through the projects. VERDICT Sewists looking for "slow-sewing" projects or hand-stitchers desiring fun projects to embellish will be drawn to Lapierre's adorable designs. * Library Journal USA * September 2016 This book, the second from Yorkshire based designer Corinne Lapierre, is packed full of 30 craft patterns sewn using felt. It is easy to think of felt being used to make decorations, but this although the book does have patterns for lots of hangers and brooches, it also contains projects for the home, such as a wall hanging organiser, a mug cosy and a cushion. I was attracted to the wide variety of designsl, and the Scandinavian influence stops the book from looking too 'cutesy'. Sometimes felt books can feel like they are aimed at children, but the choice of designs and colours prevents this, and many of the projects feel very grown up. However, it would also be an ideal present for a child, as the patterns are well written and easy to follow, plus felt is a good introduction to using a needle and thread. The beginning of the book has clear photographs with the embroidery stitches and it is this addition which really enhances the designs. There is something very satisfying about makng items from felt. With no raw edges to worry about it is easy to get lost in playing with colour, cutting and stitching, and this book will provide you with enough inspiration to keep you sewing all through the year. * Popular Patchwork *</p><h2>Negima! 31: Magister Negi Magi</h2><p>10-year-old Negi Springfield has just graduated from a British school for wizards.

Like Christ, he was said to have walked the earth performing miracle cures. His medicine was practiced by priests who interpreted patients&#39; dreams in which the god gave advice. Dr. Tick&#39;s classic work explores dream-healing techniques from this ancient tradition.</p><p><b>Edward Tick, Ph.D.</b>, is an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. A practicing psychotherapist for more than 30 years, he is a nationally recognized authority on the psychological, spiritual, historical, and cultural aspects of war in the healing of PTSD. Dr. Tick specializes in transformational work with war veterans, survivors of severe trauma, and all those in need of deep psycho-spiritual healing. Dr. Tick has extensively studied both classical Greek and Native American healing traditions and successfully integrates those methods into his modern clinical practice. A writer, educator, and overseas journey guide, Dr. Tick holds an M.A. in psychology from Goddard College and a Ph.D. in Communication from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He is a clinical member and has held various officer positions with the American Academy of Psychotherapists and the American Holistic Medical Association, as well as many other professional organizations. He is also an ordained interfaith minister. Dr. Tick began treating Vietnam veterans in psychotherapy in 1979 before PTSD was a diagnostic category. Since that time, he has treated veterans and survivors of WWII, the Holocaust, Korea, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, Central American conflicts, Lebanon, the Balkan wars, the Irish civil and religious wars, the Greek Civil War, the Middle East conflicts, and the Iraq War, among others. He has also served as a consultant to numerous community, church, and organizations on the treatment of veterans and the training of staff for such work. Dr. Tick's extraordinary work takes him on healing journeys, spiritual tours, lectures, educational classes, and workshops around the globe. He is cofounder of the Sanctuary International Friendship Foundation, a nonprofit agency that directs and raises funds for projects to help heal war-torn Viet Nam. He resides in Albany, New York, where he and his wife Kate Dahlstedt are directors of Sanctuary: A Center for Mentoring the Soul and Soldier?s Heart�, a non-profit program designed to create veterans' safe-return programs in communities across the country. Dr. Tick's last two books are entitled <i>The Golden Tortoise: Viet Nam Journeys</i> and <i>The Practice of Dream Healing: Bringing Ancient Greek Mysteries into Modern Medicine</i> (Quest 2001). His first book, <i>Sacred Mountain: Encounters with the Vietnam Beast</i>, was published in 1989.The emblem of Asklepios is familiar--two serpents twining around a staff--but few, perhaps, recognize the god's name; fewer, his repertoire of healing techniques. In this engaging study, psychotherapist Tick does more than explain the mind-body medicine of ancient Asklepian doctors. He brings us to the sites associated with the cult, from Pergamum, in present-day Turkey, to the Greek islands and mainland, and even to Rome, describing the way the sites look today and imagining, through the use of ancient texts, what they were like in their heyday. Perhaps the most intriguing is Epidauros, the great theater near Athens, where the catharsis of drama assisted people on their healing journeys. Current explorations of the impact of mental states on physical health have an impressive classical history, Tick contends. A good choice for collections where there is interest in alternative health, the book shows how ancient modern wisdom can be. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The commentary enfolds this instruction into a broad general teaching suitable for beginners that serves as an introduction to Dzogchen meditation, to the Nyingma tradition, and to basic Buddhism.<br><br>Succinct and easy to read, the text encapsulates the entire path of the nine levels of study and practice described in the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. As a result, it has much to offer both beginners and longtime meditators to support their understanding and practice.</p><p>PATRUL RINPOCHE (1808-1887) was a prominent lineage master from eastern Tibet whose teachings and writings remain widely influential in the Nyingma lineage.<br><br>KHENCHEN PALDEN SHERAB RINPOCHE (1938-2010) and his brother KHENPO TSEWANG DONGYAL RINPOCHE (b. 1950) escaped their homeland of eastern Tibet in 1959, and in the mid-1980s came to New York, where they founded the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center. PBC is now a network of over twenty centers worldwide whose mission is to spread the Buddhist teachings, particularly those of the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Together the Khenpos have published more than twenty-five books in English, with the aim of preserving and propagating the authentic teachings of the Nyingma lineage."I am so happy to hear that this book is being published! Having such texts is our great good fortune. Patrul Rinpoche was a living buddha, a bodhisattva in the flesh, so of course his teaching can be trusted and relied on completely. He wouldn&#x2019;t lie to us! Moreover, Khenchen Palden Sherab and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal are exceptional, compassionate masters of our time, not ordinary lamas. I think there is no better way to practice than by following their commentary precisely. It is my prayer that these teachings not only will be read widely but also that each practitioner will bring them into their heart with faith and sincerity. "&#x2014;Gyatrul Rinpoche, author of&nbsp;<i>Meditation, Transformation, and Dream Yoga<br></i><br>"Aro Yeshe Jungne&#x2019;s inspirational teachings on the nature of mind, which derive from the mind class of the Great Perfection, flourished during the tenth to twelfth centuries. A native of Langtang Dolma on the banks of the Yangtze in Kham, Aro possessed the instructions of seven successive masters of both Indian and Chinese lineages. His teachings were revived during the nineteenth century when they were recompiled by Patrul Rinpoche. Aro offers access to the Dzogchen perspectives on the nature of mind to persons of nine different capacities, ranging from those in whom this realization is spontaneously and effortlessly present to those who acquire it through the applications of calm abiding and superior insight. The present volume contains Sarah Harding&#x2019;s clear and lucid translation of Patrul Rinpoche&#x2019;s work, along with the contemporary oral commentary of the late Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche. It is through their kindness that these vital teachings are now widely accessible.

Growing out of the experience of oppressed people in Latin America, liberation theology lends a transforming power to both the study of the Bible and the Christian duty to work for justice for all God's people. With heartwarming, terrifying, and humorous stories, Brown shows the strength and significance of one of the outstanding developments in religious faith today and for the future.</p></p><p><b>Robert McAfee Brown</b> was a well-known theologian, writer, teacher, and social activist. He authored many books, including <i>The Bible Speaks to You</i>; <i>Liberation Theology: An Introductory Guide</i>; <i>Reclaiming the Bible<i>; <i>Religion and Violence</i>; <i>Theology in a New Key</i>; and, a novel, <i>Dark the Night, Wild the Sea</i>, all published by Westminster John Knox Press.</i></i>Brown introduces liberation theology as lived reality, revealing experiences he had in Central America that brought him new understanding of people and Christian community. His trip altered his perspective on commitment and hope, as well as on Columbus and other conquerors, and showed him a deeper encounter with God through justice-making. Brown (Pacific School of Religion) criticizes U.S. policy regarding Central America and encourages Christian witness and risk-taking on behalf of justice. This book makes liberation theology "come alive" by introducing it emotionally and spiritually, rather than as a merely intellectual concept.

But he was unprepared for the flood of vitriol in response.<br><br>The resulting blowback played out in the national media, with critics attacking Yancy in every form possible&#x2014;including death threats&#x2014;and supporters rallying to his side. Despite the rhetoric of a &#x201c;post-race&#x201d; America, Yancy quickly discovered that racism is still alive, crude, and vicious in its expression. In Backlash, Yancy expands upon the original article and chronicles the ensuing controversy as he seeks to understand what it was about the op-ed that created so much rage among so many white readers. He challenges white Americans to rise above the vitriol and to develop a new empathy for the African American experience.</p><p>George Yancy is Professor of Philosophy at Emory University. He is the author, editor and co-editor of over 18 books. He is known for his influential essays and interviews in the New York Times&#39; philosophy column, The Stone. He resides in Atlanta, Georgia.&#x201c;Direct and honest, Yancy&#x2019;s delineations of white violence, white indifference, and white na�vet� are both thoughtful and discomforting.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br>For all readers with the courage and care to act for racial and social justice. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"One of Backlash&#x2019;s greatest attributes is that it reads as the work of a philosopher operating at the intersection of higher education and public intellectualism. . . . Backlash documents what happened when Yancy wrote honestly about white racism in America; more than that, it reclaims the discursive ground away from racist reactionaries and provides a way of moving the conversation forward." (<i>The Black Scholar</i>)<br><br>Searing, honest, and Unflagging in its pursuit of understanding. (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>Rather than just acknowledging modern-day American racism, Yancy implores white readers to face the truth of their own bigotry, the privilege of their whiteness, and the ways that this whiteness inherently dehumanizes and endangers black people. . . . Yancy asks white readers to fundamentally question their sense of self, to accept the ugliness of the whiteness inherent in them. This is a monumental, incredibly difficult intellectual task. . . . Backlash is an honest, smart, and thoughtful book. . . (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>This is a timely account of how raising the issue of racism to a white public can bring out the worst of humanity: hate. . . . It is not an easy book to read, no matter what your cultural and racial heritage, because it is unutterably sad that we need such a book in 2018. But we do require such an analysis of racism, and its concomitant ally whiteness. It is ubiquitous and rather insidious in all forms of social life, from the White House to the trailer park. Yancy gives heartfelt, yet courageous, insight into how the vitriol from whites stirred his humanity to be proactive, and seek further ways to reach the unreachable. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;George Yancy&#x2019;s courageous appeal to White America &#x201c;to confront the problem of whiteness; to cultivate a critical awareness of the specter of whiteness and white privilege that each one of you inherits&#x201d; elicited a remarkable range of responses, some hideous beyond words, some welcoming what he rightly called a &#x201c;gift.&#x201d; This eloquent meditation on the events and their meaning calls on us, with piercing honesty, to think hard, and work hard, to excise the malignancy of white supremacy from our culture and our lives.&#x201d; (Noam Chomsky)<br><br>&#x201c;Backlash is a decisive intervention on a hugely important topic by a very courageous thinker. Highly recommended.&#x201d; (Simon Critchley, Hans Jonas Professor, The New School for Social Research)<br><br>&#x201c;Although fighting racism is one of the beliefs of our liberal society, not only astute social critics but also thousands of &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d; people clearly experience the falsity of the predominant liberal dogmas. Yancy conclusively demonstrates how we should move far beyond the liberal attacks on alt-right neocons towards asking the key question: to what degree the conservative backlash was made possible by the silences and compromises of the liberal perspective itself. No politically correct language policy can effectively disturb actual relations of domination and power. For this fact alone, Backlash deserves to become a classic.&#x201d; (Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek)<br><br>"Through his wisdom, his research, and his lived experience, George Yancy has provided us with a thought-provoking example of the impact of racism in America: personally and impersonally, individually and collectively. Yancy deconstructs racism in a powerful way, and deepens our understanding by sharing his personal experience. All Americans can learn from reading this text. White Americans, and for that matter members of any dominant group, should especially treat this book as a special gift." (Howard J.

With museums lining up to buy his work, and the fame he had sought relentlessly at last within his reach, speculation about whether his death was suicide or murder has titillated the art world ever since. Lombardi was an enigma who was at once a compulsive truth-teller and a cunning player of the art game, a political operative and a stubborn independent, a serious artist and a Merry Prankster, a metaphysicist if not a scientist.<br><br>Lombardi's spidery, elusive diagrams describing the evolution of the shadow-banking industry from a decades-old alliances between intelligence agencies, banking, government and organized crime, may have made him unique in art history as the only artist whose primary subject, the CIA, has turned around and studied him and his art work.

From the bestselling author of Martin Dressler, this volume explores the magnificent obsessions of the unfettered imagination, as well as the darker, subterranean currents that fuel them.<br> &nbsp;<br> With the panache of an old-fashioned magician, Steven Millhauser conducts his readers from the dark corners beneath the sunlit world to a balloonist's tour of the heavens. He transforms department stores and amusement parks into alternate universes of infinite plentitude and menace. He unveils the secrets of a maker of automatons and a coven of teenage girls. And on every page of The Knife Thrower and Other Stories, Millhauser confirms his stature as a narrative enchanter in the tradition of Nabokov, Calvino, and Borges.</p><p><i>The Knife Thrower</i> introduces a series of distinctively Millhauserian worlds: tiny, fabulous, self-enclosed, like Faberg� eggs or like the short-story genre itself. Flying carpets; subterranean amusement parks; a band of teenage girls who meet secretly in the night in order to do "nothing at all"; a store with departments of Moorish courtyards, volcanoes, and Aztec temples: these are Millhauser's stock-in-trade as a storyteller, and he employs them to characteristically magical effect. As in Millhauser's other books, including <i>Edwin Mullhouse</i> and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Martin Dressler</i>, his subject is nothing less than the faculty of imagination itself. Here, however, the flights of fancy are unencumbered by <i>Martin Dressler</i>'s wealth of period detail, and the result is fun-house prose whose pleasures and terrors are equally gossamer. Millhauser possesses the unique ability to render the quotidian strange, so that, emerging from his stories, the reader often feels the world itself an unfamiliar place--as do the shoppers at his department store, that marketplace of skillful illusion: "As we hurry along the sidewalk, we have the absurd sensation that we have entered still another department, composed of ingeniously lifelike streets with artful shadows and reflections--that our destinations lie in a far corner of the same department--that we are condemned to hurry forever through these artificial halls, bright with late afternoon light, in search of the way out."or his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, <i>Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer,</i> Steven Millhauser has always been most at home with the short story. This new collection of twelve stories puts his rich and varied talents on dazzling display, demonstrating why this singular writer is acclaimed as one of the most subtle, magical, and penetrating explorers of the American imagination.<br><br>Whether chronicling the phastasmagoric excesses of an amusement park entrepreneur in "Paradise Park," or the dangerously addictive delights of the largest department store ever conceived in "The Dream of the Consortium," Millhauser's fictions explore not only the magnificent obsessions of the unfettered imagination, but also the darker, subterranean desires that fuel them.

As Guibert of Nogent intimately recounts his early years, monastic life, and the bloody uprising at Laon in 1112, we witness a world-and a mind-populated by royals, heretics, nuns, witches, and devils, and come to understand just how fervently he was preoccupied with sin, sexuality, the afterlife, and the dark arts. Exotic, disquieting, and illuminating, the <i>Monodies</i> is a work in which the dreams, fears, and superstitions of one man illuminate the psychology of an entire people. It is joined in this volume by <i>On the Relics of Saints</i>, a theological manifesto that has never appeared in English until now.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Of equal significance are his personal impressions of day-to-day activities, which describe a social and religious world largely unfamiliar to modern readers.<p>In ministering to the sick, for instance, Clayton anointed with perfumed oil and rum. He performed baptisms to heal the sick. Church services, held irregularly, were referred to as &#x201c;going to meeting&#x201d; and seemed to be elective.

Wednesday.]1&nbsp;This morning went up to the Temple in company with my wife and sister [Sarah Ann] Whitney.2&nbsp;The morning very fine and pleasant but cold. I arrived at 10 o clock and found a number of the brethren already present and some of their wives. President [Brigham] Young engaged himself, by fixing the curtains on the East Window. I assisted him with Sisters Kimball, Pratt and Whitney. About half after 10 o clock it was reported that priest [Hamilton] Tucker (Catholic) and his associates were below waiting an interview with the Twelve and Council. At 11 1/4 Mr. [Hamilton] Tucker and Mr. [] Hamilton were admitted into the upper room of the Temple accompanied by Bishop Joseph L. Heywood who gave the gentlemen an introduction to those present. The propositions of the council in regard to the sale of our property were presented to Mr. Tucker in writing who read them over and then handed them to Mr. Hamilton who also read them. The gentlemen were then invited into President Youngs room with myself, President Young, Willard Richards, Orson Hyde, John Taylor, Amasa Lyman, John E. Page, George A. Smith, P[arley] P. Pratt, George Miller, John M. Bernhisel, Joseph L. Heywood, W[illia]m Clayton. Mr. Tucker made some observations respecting the two Main Rooms of the Temple. He thought they were so high it would be difficult for a speaker. President Young replied and explained in regard to that matter, also the pulpits, place for the Organ &amp;c. and also the side rooms. Mr. Hamilton asked a question as to the disposal of our public buildings. In answer to which Elder Hyde read aloud the written propositions and offered some explanations. A conversation then followed between Mr. Tucker, President Young and Elder Hyde on the subject. President Young remarked that we wish to realise from the sale of our property, sufficient to take all our poor with us in a comfortable manner.3If he was alone he could take his rifle and make his way to the Pacific with little difficulty but at the same time he don&#x2019;t wish to do it. He would rather have his wagons and go with all the rest of the Church comfortable.</p><p>Mr. Tucker said he thought it would be wisdom to publish our propositions in all the Catholic papers, and lay the matter plain before their people. He should also think it advisable for the Catholic Bishops to send a competent committee to asertain the value of our property &amp;c. at the same time they will use all their influence to effect a sale as speedily as possible. He thinks they have men in St. Louis, New York and other Cities who could soon raise the amount we want, but the time is so very short, he dont know whether it can be done so soon. He then asked if we would be willing to have our propositions published in their papers. President Young replied we should have no objections providing it was understood that we reserve the right to sell when we had a chance. Elder P. P. Pratt thought it would be well to talk over the propositions and investigate them so as to have every thing perfectly and clearly understood. Mr. Hamilton wished to ascertain upon what conditions they could obtain two of our public buildings, one for a school and one for a Church. They intended to write to the Bishop and wished to be able to supply him with some information on this subject.</p><p>President Young said he was well aware that there were many men in the Catholic Church who could furnish all the money we want at once, but he supposed it was with them as it was with a Mr. Butler who owned a wealthy Bank and asked why he did not sign off more Bills. He replied it was a good deal of trouble to sign off the Bills. He supposed it was too much trouble for them to dig their money out of their vaults. But he wished it understood that while we make a liberal proposition to dispose of our property we must have the means to help ourselves away.</p><p>Mr. Tucker said their object was to write to the Bishop and enclose our propositions in his letter, at the same time advising him either to come himself or to appoint a committee of efficient men to come and value the property and enter into terms for a final agreement. He said the sum to be raised was large and the time very short to the first of April but he thinks it can be accomplished. He thinks they can be able to give us a decided answer by the 25th inst.</p><p>President Young said he would like to add a note to our proposals before it goes for publication to this effect that If they agree to our propositions we will lease them the Temple for a period of from five to thirty 5 years at a reasonable price, the rent to be paid in finishing the unfinished parts of the Temple, the wall around the Temple Block, and the Block West of the Temple, and keeping the Temple in repair.</p><p>The council agreed to the amendment which was accordingly added to the proposals and handed to Mr. Tucker.</p><p>Mr. Tucker seemed to give much encouragement that an arrangement would speedily be entered into, to accomplish what we want. Both the gentlemen seem highly pleased with the Temple and the City and appear to feel sanguine that the Catholics should get this Temple and vicinity.</p><p>About half past 12 they departed evidently feeling well towards us.</p><p>W. W. Phelps has been appointed door keeper this day in place of Elder George A. Smith who is engaged with matters of more importance ....4</p><p>At half past 3 o clock President Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball, John Taylor, P. P. Pratt, George Miller, Alpheus Cutler, Wm. Clayton, John M. Bernhisel and Lucien Woodworth retired to the Bishops room and consecrated 16 bottles of Oil which had been perfumed by Bishop Whitney for the purpose of anointing.5</p><p>At 1/4 to 4 Elder Hyde came into my room and brought tidings that our Sheriff J[acob] B. Backenstos was clear and acquitted.6&nbsp;The jury said if there had been no witnesses only on the part of the state it would not have required two minutes to have made up their verdict. They have got two of the mob witnesses in jail for perjury and Backenstos is gone to Springfield to request the Governor to withdraw his troops.</p><p>At 3 o clock Sister Mary Ann Young and Vilate Kimball, Elizabeth Ann Whitney, commenced washing and anointing each other being the first in this holy Temple of the Lord.7&nbsp;This was done in the preparation room in the North West corner of the Attic story. About the same time President Young put up the vail8&nbsp;in its place which things finish and complete the Celestial Room preparatory to the endowment . . .9</p><p>At 25 minutes past 4 o clock President Young and Heber C.

Lott. We continued washing and anointing those present till about 7 1/2 o clock.</p><p>At 20 minutes to 8 o clock President Young announced that all things were now ready to commence and go through with the ordinances. He said that after we get properly organized and ready to go on without confusion, no person will be permitted to talk, nor walk about in the main rooms, neither would any person be expected to be in the Celestial room only those who were necessary to carry on the work. At the same hour he took the chair and appointed P. P. Pratt and John Taylor to assist him in taking those through who were now prepared. W. W. Phelps acted as serpent10&nbsp;. . .

For the last decade of his life, however, Waugh experienced the changes being made to the Church's liturgy to be nothing short of "a bitter trial". In John Cardinal Heenan, Waugh found a sympathetic pastor and somewhat of a kindred spirit. </p><p>This volume brings together the personal correspondence between Waugh and Heenan during the 1960s, a trying period for many faithful Catholics. It begins with a 1962 article Waugh wrote for the <i>Spectator</i> followed by a response from then Archbishop Heenan, who at the time was a participant at the Second Vatican Council. These and the other writings included in this book paint a vivid picture of two prominent and loyal English Catholics who lamented the loss of Latin and the rupture of tradition that resulted from Vatican II. </p><p>In the light of the pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI, many Catholics are looking again at the post-conciliar liturgical changes. To this "reform of the reform" of the liturgy now underway in the Roman Catholic Church, both Heenan and Waugh have much to contribute.</p></p><p>Dom Alcuin Reid is a monk of the Monastere Saint-Benoit in the Diocese of Frejus-Toulon, France. After studies in Theology and in Education in Melbourne, Australia, he was awarded a PhD from King's College, University of London, for a thesis on twentieth century liturgical reform (2002), which was subsequently published as The Organic Development of the Liturgy with a preface by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger. He has lectured internationally and has published extensively on the sacred liturgy, including Looking Again at the Question of the Liturgy with Cardinal Ratzinger (2003), The Monastic Diurnal, The Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described (2009), A Bitter Trial: Evelyn Waugh and John Carmel Cardinal Heenan on the Liturgical Changes (2011). His writings have been translated into Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Lithuanian, Polish and Croatian. <p>Dom Alcuin takes his place at the centre of the new liturgical movement called for by Cardinal Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) promoting an authentic interpretation of the Second Vatican Council's call for liturgical reform within a hermeneutic of continuity, a critical assessment of its implementation and of the need for a reform of the reform, as well as an openness to the value and riches of the usus antiquior in the Church of the twenty-first century. He was the principal organiser of Sacra Liturgia 2013, the international conference on the role liturgical formation and celebration in the life and mission of the Church in Rome in June 2013, and edited its proceedings Sacred Liturgy: The Source and Summit of the Life and Mission of the Church (2014). He coordinates the ongoing Sacra Liturgia initiatives.</p></p><h2>The Art of the Wasted Day</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;A sharp and unconventional book &#x2014; a swirl of memoir, travelogue and biography of some of history's champion day-dreamers.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;</b>Maureen Corrigan, "Fresh Air"</b><br><br>A spirited inquiry into the lost value of leisure and daydream</b><br><br><i>The Art of the Wasted Day</i> is a picaresque travelogue of leisure written from a lifelong enchantment with solitude. Patricia Hampl visits the homes of historic exemplars of ease who made repose a goal, even an art form. She begins with two celebrated eighteenth-century Irish ladies who ran off to live a life of "retirement" in rural Wales. Her search then leads to Moravia to consider the monk-geneticist, Gregor Mendel, and finally to Bordeaux for Michel Montaigne--the hero of this book--who retreated from court life to sit in his chateau tower and write about whatever passed through his mind, thus inventing the personal essay. <br><br>Hampl's own life winds through these pilgrimages, from childhood days lazing under a neighbor's beechnut tree, to a fascination with monastic life, and then to love--and the loss of that love which forms this book's silver thread of inquiry. Finally, a remembered journey down the Mississippi near home in an old cabin cruiser with her husband turns out, after all her international quests, to be the great adventure of her life. <br><br>The real job of being human, Hampl finds, is getting lost in thought, something only leisure can provide. <i>The Art of the Wasted Day</i> is a compelling celebration of the purpose and appeal of letting go.</p><p><b>Patricia Hampl</b> first stepped onto the literary scene with <i>A Romantic Education</i>, a Cold War memoir about her Czech heritage. Four of her books have been named Notable Books of the Year by <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>.

The tree belongs to Mr. Kinney, the shade is ours. It must be 1953,because the Magnavox has just been delivered from McGowan&#x2019;s TV and Appliance onGrand. It&#x2019;s not just for watching Lucy, my mother says, already mistrusting it.&#x201c;You&#x2019;re seeing history.&#x201d; She points to the first smudged image she allows us tosee&#x2014;the Koreans and Chinese and Americans signing their names in a big Bibleybook. &#x201c;Peace,&#x201d; she says, settling in with her cigs, the chipped cloisonn�ashtray at hand.</p><p>An announcer drones from the glass box, murmuring names.One after another, men approach the heavy table to sign the book, each handinga fountain pen to the next. Mother taps her cig against the little Chineseashtray, a gift, she tells me, from her uncle who was a U.S. Customs agent inSan Francisco, half a world away from us in St. Paul. He got the ashtray whenhe broke an opium smuggling ring, she says proudly. He left the ashtray to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Did he steal it?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>She looks startled. &#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; she says uncertainly,turning back to the television. This is going to take a long time, the menhanding the pen back and forth. History, it turns out, is boring.</p><p>So I come out here, throw myself on the ground where thefeathers of the beechnut sway and tilt. The green filigree patterns the sky, light filters my face. It&#x2019;s hard (the ground), yet also soft (the sponge oflawn). I shut my eyes. The Customs agent uncle, dead before I was born, isstanding on a San Francisco dock. Does he have a gun? He has a badge, that Isee. He lifts the blue cloisonn� ashtray out of a burlap bag, and a Chinese manhas his hands up in the air. He has a long pigtail I recognize from theblack-and-red lacquer tray Mother brings up with soup and saltines when we&#x2019;re sick in bed. There must be a gun somewhere, but where is it?</p><p>The scene fades, and a fresh image appears, our next-doorneighbor Mr. Kinney, who presents himself in the dark for no reason. There heis, filling my mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Kinney is a widower. My mother says his wife has beendead &#x201c;forever.&#x201d; A hush of respect hovers over this fact. Because he is awidower and because he &#x201c;has money,&#x201d; he has a housekeeper. She doesn&#x2019;t like me.She wears a flowered apron trimmed with rickrack, and herdesignation&#x2014;housekeeper&#x2014;makes her slightly sinister. Who has a housekeeper? Notnormal people. Only Mr. Kinney, a widower without children but with money. Heowns the coke factory near the zoo, a place of foreboding, heaps of blackenedcoal, acrid, smoking. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll have to clean that up one day,&#x201d; my father says.</p><p>Mr. Kinney sits in his glassed-in sunporch before dinner,sipping whiskey from a lowball glass. He drinks after dinner too, slowly,meditatively. He reads, his old smooth head glowing under the floor lamp. Hehas decided against a television set, he informs my father who has inquired if,with the windows open in summer, the sound of the Magnavox carries. We&#x2019;ve allnoticed the nasty bark of the laugh track, nothing like real laughing.</p><p>He&#x2019;s decided to stick with books, Mr. Kinney tells myfather. He also listens to the radio as Halsey Hall calls the ball game in avoice juicy from a chewed cigar. You can see Mr. Kinney leaning back in hissloping armchair, eyes closed, following the game. Another person who shuts hiseyes to see. In the summer you can hear the metallic chink of ice in thelowball glass. He drinks alone, my mother says.</p><p>When you close your eyes, you see and hear things youdidn&#x2019;t notice before, though they must have been there all along. It&#x2019;s not thatyou make things up&#x2014;you notice things. Maybe that&#x2019;s a kind of making up? Hard tosay. But it&#x2019;s all more real than history blatting away in the living room wheremy mother stares at the gray glass, tapping her cig against the little saucerof the blue ashtray taken from the Chinese man with his hands above his head.Mother is still there, as the pen passes from a Chinese man to an American andon to the next and the next. She&#x2019;s happy. She&#x2019;s watching peace occur in thewide world. Peace is vital to her: We had to drop the bomb, darling. It endedthe War. It saved lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But now, here, under the shade of the beechnut, I floatpast the Customs agent and the Chinese smuggler, over the disapproving face ofMr. Kinney&#x2019;s housekeeper, above mild Mr. Kinney himself, swirling his oilydrink on his sunporch. Day after day, night after night during my endlessgirlhood I float away like this.</p><p>My father says Mr. Kinney takes his bourbon on the rocks.Mr. Kinney is slipping down a craggy cliffside under a shower of coal dust. Heteeters off his sunporch&#x2014;takes his bourbon on the rocks, drinks alone.</p><p>There&#x2019;s something orchestral about all this. My father&#x2019;svoice, my mother&#x2019;s, the chink of ice, the echo chamber of that word&#x2014;alone. Amelodic moan struggles out of the sad-souled vowel at the word&#x2019;s deadcenter&#x2014;the sob at the core of alone. O! The stagey hand-on-heart intonation atthe beginning of poems that Great-Aunt Aggie recites&#x2014;O to be in England, O fora beaker of the warm South . . . Bourbon on the rocks. Well, it&#x2019;s sad,darling&#x2014;he drinks alone. O! O!</p><p>Words are partly thoughts, but mostly they&#x2019;re music, deepdown. Thinking itself is, perhaps, orchestral, the mind conducting the world.Conducting it, constructing it. I sense this instinctively.</p><p>There is no language for this, not then, not even now,this inner glide, articulation of the wordless, plotless truth of existence.Life is not made up of stories, much as I adore them&#x2014;Charlotte, Heidi, CaddieWoodlawn. Really, life is&#x2014;this. It&#x2019;s a float, my body a cloud drifting along,effortless but aware. Drifting over the world, seeing, passing along.</p><p>Years later, peering across from the Kinney sunporch toours, Mr. Kinney&#x2019;s housekeeper glimpses me roiling around on the couch with myfirst boyfriend and reports this to my grandmother, who conveys theintelligence to my mother&#x2014;She had a hippie boy out there&#x2014;with the vindicatedface of a tattling teacher&#x2019;s pet.</p><p>At eight I don&#x2019;t yet see the hippie boys or the claspingand kissing, but already I recognize the look on the housekeeper&#x2019;s face. It isthe aggrieved visage of the unloved, thwarted, and denied. The flaccid cheeksslip downward, the sour line of the lips tightens. That sharp eye on the prowl,passing from the back door to the trash can with her bag of refuse, frowning atme lolling under the shade of her employer&#x2019;s beechnut tree. She&#x2019;s a busybody.</p><p>She recognizes me too for what I am: her natural enemy. Agirl up to no good, lazing my days away, conducting music no one else hears. Atime-waster. A daydreamer.</p><p>&nbsp;Which poses a problem: in a few months we will make ourFirst Confession. We have reached the age of reason. Sister says we now knowthe difference between Good and Evil. She has given us the buff-coloredBaltimore Catechism and directed us to the &#x201c;Examination of Conscience&#x201d; at theback to help us prepare for our first whispered recitation in the basement ofSt. Luke&#x2019;s. The Ten Commandments are listed, each with its complement of sinsand &#x201c;occasions of sin,&#x201d; which are to be avoided.</p><p>I have located Disobedience (number 4) and Lying (number8) as my province, as well as the diffuse &#x201c;Unkind Gossip,&#x201d; an all-purpose sinthat seems to belong to no particular commandment, but exists as an aura aroundall human relations. Then I reach the combined list of sins and occasions ofsin for Commandments 9 and 10, where all the Coveting goes on. There,shockingly, without explanation, is the word. Daydreaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Busted. An official sin, ratified by the BaltimoreCatechism. I stare at it, disbelieving.</p><p>To refuse to admit to a sin listed in the &#x201c;Examination ofConscience&#x201d; is a disobedience more profound&#x2014;this I know&#x2014;than the trivialitiesagainst my mother and father I&#x2019;ve been toting up for presentation to FatherKennedy in the little curtained box in St. Luke&#x2019;s basement. A bad confession isthe worst sin of all. Mortal.</p><p>But daydreaming, this effortless flight of the mind? I&#x2019;mthunderstruck. Yet also oddly confirmed. A faint bell chimes within&#x2014;of coursethe imagination is up to no good. You know that, you were born knowing that.It&#x2019;s the real, the true occasion of sin. Under the beechnut tree, leavesswishing, the sound of the oily sluice&#x2014;chink, chink-chink&#x2014;alone on the rocks. Oalone. But connected to everything, conducting the unheard harmony that is thetruest music. The sweetness of it, lolling under the filtered light of heaven.You possess everything that passes through the mind. It&#x2019;s divinity. That mustbe the sweetness.</p><p>That must be the sin.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t just mentally reject this sin. I tra-la my waypast it. A higher editorial power takes over. I unsee it, unread it. That&#x2019;spart of this daydream paradise&#x2014;unthinking my own thinking. I excise the wordfrom the Baltimore Catechism, from my mind. I&#x2019;m gripped by refusal. It&#x2019;s a formof loyalty. I&#x2019;m never letting go of this.</p><p>The tendency to float, to depart, to rest&#x2014;this powerresides within me. It&#x2019;s right in there, jammed into the space where I&#x2019;ve beentaught conscience also resides&#x2014;inside. Listen to your inner voice, children. Itwill guide you. Right here, Sister says, not reaching up to her wimpled head,but touching a pale hand to her obscure bosom under the gloomy tarp of herhabit. Right here. That&#x2019;s where truth is. You always know&#x2014;if you consult here.No one questions&#x2014;I still have not questioned&#x2014;that there is an inner voice to beheard.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t hesitate. I throw my lot with the occasion ofsin. I already know (or believe&#x2014;which comes to the same thing in my Catholicworldview) that daydreaming doesn&#x2019;t make things up. It sees things. Claimsthings, twirls them around, takes a good look. Possesses them. Embraces them.Makes something of them. Makes sense. Or music. How restful it is, how full ofmotion. My first paradox.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t care less what it&#x2019;s called. It&#x2019;s purepleasure. Infinite delight. For this a person goes to hell.</p><p>Okay then.</p><p>Though I don&#x2019;t yet know it, though Sister has her hand onher breast, this is what is called the life of the mind. It&#x2019;s what I want todo. It&#x2019;s where I want to be. Right here.</p><p>-</p><p>Fast forward. More than forty years, and what&#x2019;s become of&#x201c;the life of the mind&#x201d;? Hand on heart, the inner voice still murmuring? I&#x2019;vetaken my place, middle seat, my husband on the aisle, a plump woman alreadyseated by the window. I fasten my seat belt, low and tight as instructed. Myhusband takes my right hand, gives it a squeeze, opens his book.</p><p>The plane taxis forward, the woman next to me is lookingwith pleasant curiosity out the window. Blue skies, no wind.</p><p>We lift off, levitating at a rather sharp angle, withoutshimmy or rattle or bobble. A confident plane. We&#x2019;re up cleanly at a sheerslant. And I&#x2019;m dying.</p><p>It is impossible to breathe in this canister hurlingitself on high. The thing is not properly pressurized. No one can breathe inhere. We will all die, or&#x2014;another possibility occurs in the same instant&#x2014;we mayland safely, but we&#x2019;ll be a planeful of brain-damaged droolers. Alive, butgone, gone.</p><p>I have picked up on the truth sooner than the others. Butdidn&#x2019;t teachers often say I was quick? In a moment these poor souls will beleaping from their places, madly clawing for air. At least I will die withdignity. My eyes fasten on a hopelessly unaware man farther forward on theaisle, sitting calmly with his newspaper open. I wait for him to leap up, hurlthe paper aside, clutch his throat. He won&#x2019;t be dying with dignity. But I will.I sit still, frozen in my dignity.</p><p>The woman by the window has taken my left hand. She&#x2019;sstroking it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all right,&#x201d; she&#x2019;s saying. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a labor and delivery roomnurse, and you&#x2019;re all right.&#x201d; Does she think I&#x2019;m pregnant? I&#x2019;m over fifty.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all right,&#x201d; she keeps saying. Very annoyingsingsong. &#x201c;Look at your hand.&#x201d;</p><p>I look. There it is. And her hand, stroking mine.</p><p>&#x201c;See? It isn&#x2019;t blue. If you were dying your hand would beblue.&#x201d; It would? I realize I&#x2019;m gasping. Loudly, raggedly.</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t been dying with dignity. I have been making&#x2014;amstill making&#x2014;weird gagging sounds, desperate, wild. My husband looks alarmed.He has taken my other hand. I feel bound, and rip my hands away from thesedeluded hand-holders who somehow are managing to breathe in this airlesscylinder.</p><p>The labor and delivery nurse hands me the airsickness bagfrom the seat pocket. &#x201c;Breathe into this,&#x201d; she says, commanding now, notgentle. &#x201c;Put the bag to your mouth, bend your head. Breathe. In. Out. Breathe.Out. Out. Deep out.&#x201d;</p><p>This I do. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re having a panic attack,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t dying.&#x201d;</p><p>What does she know? Everything in me tells me I&#x2019;m dying. I&#x2019;m a writer. I trust my instincts, I live by my wits. But I do as she says,breathing deep into the bag. No one is leaping around. That gets through to me.Only my husband looks bug-eyed, leaning toward me, but no longer touching mebecause I have batted him away.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not dying,&#x201d; the nurse repeats with irritatingcertainty. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got too much oxygen in your system. Breathe out. Deep. Deep!Out! We&#x2019;ll get that carbon dioxide level up. You&#x2019;re having a panic attack,&#x201d; shesays again. She pats my leg briskly, not unkindly. She&#x2019;s seen this before.</p><p>She hits the call button. I&#x2019;m given a glass of water.&#x201c;Drink.&#x201d; Breathe, drink, live to see another day. Live to tell the tale.</p><p>&#x201c;Better?&#x201d; the nurse says pleasantly after the water isgone. A pat on the leg. &#x201c;Better?&#x201d;</p><p>Not really. Not dying, but not better. My husband isthanking her profusely. He&#x2019;s holding my hand. I allow this, my cold meat pattyin his beautiful warm, dry hand. His beautiful hand I&#x2019;ve always loved. I loveit again, which is a sign I&#x2019;m not dying. The nurse has turned back to thewindow, enjoying the bed of pillowy clouds we rest upon.</p></p><h2>Inside-Out Healing: Transforming Your Life Through the Power of Presence</h2><p>Join world-renowned consciousness teacher and healer Richard Moss in an exploration of the power of presence in your life.

Included are Hixon's consultations of the I Ching and an explication of Turiya as taught by Advaita Vedanta and experienced by Hixon with Swami Nikhilananda as his teacher. Though the tone is not consistent--some chapters are philosophical, others personal, still others purely expository--the book is certainly worth consideration.<br><i>- Carolyn M. Craft, Longwood Coll., Farmville, Va.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Her Majesty&#39;s Spymaster: Elizabeth I, Sir Francis Walsingham, and the Birth of Modern Espionage</h2><p>Sir Francis Walsingham&#x2019;s official title was principal secretary to Queen Elizabeth I, but in fact this pious, tight-lipped Puritan was England&#x2019;s first spymaster. A ruthless, fiercely loyal civil servant, Walsingham worked brilliantly behind the scenes to foil Elizabeth&#x2019;s rival Mary Queen of Scots and outwit Catholic Spain and France, which had arrayed their forces behind her. Though he cut an incongruous figure in Elizabeth&#x2019;s worldly court, Walsingham managed to win the trust of key players like William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester before launching his own secret campaign against the queen&#x2019;s enemies. Covert operations were Walsingham&#x2019;s genius; he pioneered techniques for exploiting double agents, spreading disinformation, and deciphering codes with the latest code-breaking science that remain staples of international espionage.</p><p>Stephen Budiansky, journalist and military historian, is the author of nine books about history, science, and nature, including <b>Air Power:</b> <b>The Men, Machines, and Ideas That Revolutionized War, from Kitty Hawk to Gulf War II</b>. He publishes frequently in <b>The New York Times</b> and <b>The Washington Post</b> and currently serves as a correspondent for <b>The Atlantic Monthly</b>.At her trial in 1586, the doomed Mary Queen of Scots challenged her chief accuser, Sir Francis Walsingham, to show the court the documents that proved she had been plotting to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I from her prison cell. If such evidence existed, why had it not been produced? "I have a right to demand to see the originals and the copies side by side," Mary said. "It is quite possible that my ciphers have been tampered with by my enemies. I cannot reply to this accusation without full knowledge. Until then, I must content myself with affirming solemnly that I am not guilty of the crimes imputed to me." <p>Mary, however, had badly underestimated Walsingham, master of Elizabeth's intelligence service. Not only had he intercepted and copied every one of Mary's letters to and from the alleged conspirators, which were in due course produced as evidence. He also presented the court with "facsimiles" of key incriminating documents. All her correspondence to and fro had been secretly monitored for months. His agents had made copies of any letters that might subsequently be used in evidence against her, then resealed the originals and allowed them to pass on to their destination. The surreptitious copies were so faithful that when they were produced during interrogation, Mary's servants -- who had carefully destroyed the incriminating originals -- broke down and confessed all.</p><p>Too late, Mary protested that it was "an easy matter to counterfeit the ciphers and characters of others" and she was "afraid this was done by Walsingham" to ensure her conviction. Walsingham was unabashed. He had only done what was necessary to protect the English queen and ensure the safety of her person and the realm. The court was persuaded of Mary's guilt, sentence was duly passed and she was executed the following February.</p><p>In Her Majesty's Spymaster, Stephen Budiansky retells the story of how "intelligencers" working for Queen Elizabeth's senior ministers ensnared enemies of the state. He justifies going over this well-trodden territory on the grounds that Walsingham originated the idea of a network of secret agents reporting to a single controller. In our own surveillance-obsessed era, it is of interest to discover the roots of modern spy networks.</p><p>In fact, the Elizabethan state as a whole was obsessed with collecting intelligence -- every possible sort of information that might give the statesman power over English men and women. Elizabeth's subjects lived in what was effectively a police state, their every move monitored for any sign of political or religious dissent. Lords Burleigh and Walsingham, the Earls of Leicester and Essex, all vied with one another for the most efficient information-gathering team of agents. Sir Francis Bacon and his brother Anthony were among the many men-about-court who were recruited as spies by one faction or another.</p><p>The days when heads of intelligence services like Walsingham could behave in the unscrupulous way that brought about Mary's downfall are long gone. Today neither the CIA nor MI5 would have the political confidence or executive independence to act with that kind of panache, on the assumption that intercepting privileged correspondence, counterfeiting evidence and interfering with witnesses were all permissible to protect the interests of the head of state. However heinous are today's crimes (9/11 or the London bombings), the search for perpetrators has to be conducted scrupulously, following due process and according suspects their full civil rights. Perhaps the contrast between now and then explains why modern readers are intrigued by historical accounts about Elizabeth I's spymasters. The stories are reminiscent of cold-war spy thrillers -- we're diverted and entertained by the chess-game moves, as agents and counter-agents trap unsuspecting victims.</p><p>Budiansky does his best to convince the reader that this really is a world still relevant to us today. He tells the tale of Walsingham and his spies with all the bravura of a historical novelist. His accounts of events and personalities associated with Elizabethan espionage are full of suspense and melodrama. In the end, though, Her Majesty's Spymaster is no truer to the murky political world of Elizabethan England than the movie "Shakespeare in Love" was to the historical reality of Shakespeare's life. All doublet and hose and swashbuckling machismo, written in a breathless, archaic style reminiscent of historians of 50 years ago, Budiansky's book panders unashamedly to our fondness for nostalgia.</p><p>As an academic who specializes in the Tudor period, I find it hard to take Her Majesty's Spymaster seriously as history, but it is written in a racy, popular style that may capture the imagination of the general reader. Those who find comfort in the idea that Elizabethan England was a place of starched ruffs, conspiracy and romance may well enjoy the book's rehearsal of familiar themes. After all, in spite of its corniness and inaccuracy, and a good deal of caviling and head-shaking from Shakespeare scholars, "Shakespeare in Love" went on to become a worldwide box-office success. </p><p>Reviewed by Lisa Jardine <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

The good coach, it turns out, had a nasty habit of getting sexually involved with teenage girls, and that criminal predilection led to his death. One of Duffy's victims had died recently, too, supposedly a suicide. Her case is reopened after the coach's predatory ways are discovered.

Accordingly, the play must be understood as a sketch of the tragedy of man and his destiny, a problem which again is acquiring legitimacy and urgency, outstepping from the serious Spanish theatre studies into the surrounding reality. Two aspects are set down as intentionally dominant within the plan of Buero Vallejo&#39;s work. One is the social relationship, a mixture of free and forced situations, which arestablished between a strong individuality whose reasoning and frustration conflict with the reasoning and passion of the community. The other involves the tension of the visionary, the yearning for &#34;light&#34; and the belief in it which occasionally distinguishes the people of genuine religious feelings facing the material interests of the majority.</p><p>If you include En la Ardiente Oscuridad in your courses syllabus this is an edition worth considering: fully annotated and easily available in the US.</p><h2>The Essential Sheehan: A Lifetime of Running Wisdom from the Legendary Dr. George Sheehan</h2><p>Runners and readers whose connections to the sport date back to the 1970s surely remember Dr. George Sheehan, the New Jersey cardiologist and writer whose unique approach to the joy of exercise helped spark America's fitness boom.

GEORGE SHEEHAN was a respected cardiologist, accomplished runner, and bestselling author of eight books on the importance of exercise and sport. One of the pioneers of the fitness boom of the late &#39;70s, he was dubbed by many as the runner&#39;s &#34;guru,&#34; but his audience encompassed all athletes. He passed away in 1993.&#x201c;November 1 marks the 20th anniversary of Dr. George Sheehan's death and the publication of The Essential Sheehan: A Lifetime of Running Wisdom from the Legendary Dr. George Sheehan (Rodale). "Twenty years after George Sheehan's passing," says Mark Weinstein, executive editor, Rodale Books, "his message is as relevant and as needed as ever, if not more so. Sadly, the vast majority of his work is now out of print, so the idea behind the release of <i>The Essential Sheehan</i> (and the re-release of his classic, Running and Being) is to introduce his writings to a whole new generation of readers and runners" There will be an excerpt of <i>The Essential Sheehan</i> in the December issue of Runner's World and there will be promotions at both the Chicago and New York marathons.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book is sure to inspire&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>EXAMINER.COM</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a must-have book for any runner.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>SALTMARSHRUNNING.COM</i><br><br>&#x201c;Reading this book will be a major treat...&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>RUN BLOG RUN</i><br><br>&#x201c;These excerpts from his books and columns can help provide the renewal many of us may be able to put to excellent use when we &#x2018;hit the wall' of life...Call it a gold-medal read.

After fifteen years of farming, Catherine Friend is tired. After all, while shepherding is one of the oldest professions, it&#x2019;s not getting any easier. The number of sheep in America has fallen by 90 percent in the last ninety years. But just as Catherine thinks it&#x2019;s time to hang up her shepherd&#x2019;s crook, she discovers that sheep might be too valuable to give up.

Once one of the most sought-after young women in Virginia society, she was denounced as a ruined Jezebel, and the great orator Patrick Henry and future Supreme Court justice John Marshall were retained to defend her in a sensational trial. This gripping account of murder, infanticide, prostitution charges, moral decline, and heroism that played out in the intimate lives of the nation&#39;s Founding Fathers is as riveting and revealing as any current scandal -- in or out of Washington.</p><p><i>Unwise Passions</i> traces the trajectory of aristocrat Nancy Randolph's tempestuous life, beginning with her privileged birth in 1774, continuing through a series of scandals that eventually sent her North, and concluding with her death in 1837. But this engaging, accessible biography also serves as group portrait of the Virginia aristocracy--and of its declining fortunes, as the colonial oligarchy was supplanted by an unrulier democracy. When she was only 18, Nancy was accused of having borne a child to her own sister's husband, Richard Randolph, who then allegedly murdered the newborn. Defended by Revolutionary legend Patrick Henry, Richard and Nancy were acquitted, and she returned to live with him and her sister. But the rumors persisted, and Richard's sudden death in 1796 only made them uglier. Many of the ugliest rumors were voiced by Richard's younger brother, Jack; Nancy's former suitor. Jack improved the debt-riddled family estates while he pursued a political career as a fiery states-rights congressman (a career that gets nearly as much of the author's attention as Nancy's life). Virginia-based journalist Alan Pell Crawford doesn't conclude definitively whether or not Jack actually believed Nancy had murdered his brother and had sexual relations with a slave, but the congressman certainly hated her enough to throw her off the family farm and repeat those stories later to her husband. At age 34, reduced to poverty and living in New York, the long-suffering Nancy married Gouverneur Morris, another wealthy veteran of the Revolutionary generation. Their happy union produced one child and endured until his death. Crawford, also the author of <i>Thunder on the Right</i>, pens a lively narrative that vividly evokes his characters: kindhearted, rather frivolous Nancy; urbane, unshockable Morris; irascible, overwrought Jack; and a host of cousins who are scattered throughout America's inbred, gossipy high society. Good fun and good history, to boot. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Alan Pell Crawford</b> is the author of <i>Thunder on the Right: The "New Right" and the Politics of Resentment,</i> which <i>The New Republic</i> called "a significant work of political and intellectual history."

Growing up after World War I and the collapse of the empire, Rezzori lived in a twilit world suspended between the formalities of the old nineteenth-century order which had shaped his aristocratic parents and the innovations, uncertainties, and raw terror of the new century. The haunted atmosphere of this dying world is beautifully rendered in the pages of <i>The Snows of Yesteryear</i>.<br><br> The book is a series of portraits&#x2014;amused, fond, sometimes appalling&#x2014;of Rezzori&#x2019;s family: his hysterical and histrionic mother, disappointed by marriage, destructively obsessed with her children&#x2019;s health and breeding; his father, a flinty reactionary, whose only real love was hunting; his haughty older sister, fated to die before thirty; his earthy nursemaid, who introduced Rezzori to the power of storytelling and the inevitability of death; and a beloved governess, Bunchy. Telling their stories, Rezzori tells his own, holding his early life to the light like a crystal until it shines for us with a prismatic brilliance.</p><p>Gregor von Rezzori (1914&#x2013;1998) was born in Czernowitz (now Chernovtsy, Ukraine), Bukovina, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He later described his childhood in a family of declining fortunes as one &#x201c;spent among slightly mad and dislocated personalities in a period that also was mad and dislocated and filled with unrest.&#x2019;&#x2019; After studying at the University of Vienna, Rezzori moved to Bucharest and enlisted in the Romanian army. During World War II, he lived in Berlin, where he worked as a radio broadcaster and published his first novel. In West Germany after the war, he wrote for both radio and film and began publishing books at a rapid rate, including the four-volume <i>Idiot&#x2019;s Guide to German Society</i> and <i>Ein Hermelin in Tschernopol </i>(to be published by NYRB Classics as <i>Ermine</i>). From the late 1950s on, Rezzori had parts in several French and West German films, including one directed by his friend Louis Malle. In 1967, after spending years classified as a stateless person, Rezzori settled in a fifteenth-century farmhouse outside of Florence with his wife, gallery owner Beatrice Monti. There he produced some of his best-known works, among them <i>Death of My Brother Abel</i>, <i>Memoirs of an Anti-Semite</i> (published by NYRB Classics), and the memoir <i>The Snows of Yesteryear: Portraits for an Autobiography</i>.<br><br>John Banville was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945.

Rejecting the prevailing sentimental stereotypes of her times, she portrayed her black characters with sympathy and understanding, endowing them with the full dimensions of human consciousness.

Kim F. Hall's eagerly awaited book is the first to view these evocations of blackness in the contexts of sexual politics, imperialism, and slavery in early modern England. Her work reveals the vital link between England's expansion into realms of difference and otherness&#x2015;through exploration and colonialism-and the highly charged ideas of race and gender which emerged.</p><p>How, Hall asks, did new connections between race and gender figure in Renaissance ideas about the proper roles of men and women? What effect did real racial and cultural difference have on the literary portrayal of blackness? And how did the interrelationship of tropes of race and gender contribute to a modern conception of individual identity? Hall mines a wealth of sources for answers to these questions: travel literature from Sir John Mandeville's <i>Travels</i> to Leo Africanus's <i>History and Description of Africa</i>; lyric poetry and plays, from Shakespeare's <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Tempest</i> to Ben Jonson's <i>Masque of Blackness</i>; works by Emilia Lanyer, Philip Sidney, John Webster, and Lady Mary Wroth; and the visual and decorative arts. Concentrating on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Hall shows how race, sexuality, economics, and nationalism contributed to the formation of a modern ( white, male) identity in English culture. The volume includes a useful appendix of not readily accessible Renaissance poems on blackness.</p></p><p><p>Kim F.

Find out more at www.vikramchandra.com.Setting 18th- and 19th-century Mogul India against the open highways of contemporary America and fusing Indian myth, Hindu gods, magic and mundane reality, this intricate first novel is a magnificent epic that welds the exfoliating storytelling style of A Thousand and One Nights to modernist fictional technique. Abhay, an Indian college student studying in the U.S. but home on vacation in Bombay, shoots a scavenging monkey; the dying creature reveals itself to be the reincarnation of Sanjay Parasher, a fiery, iconoclastic 19th-century poet and freedom-fighter against British rule. To remain alive, the monkey strikes a deal with the gods: he must keep Abhay's family entertained each day by telling stories of his former lives. Around this fanciful premise, Indian novelist Chandra has built a powerful, moving saga that explores colonialism, death and suffering, ephemeral pleasure and the search for the meaning of life. Through the monkey's tales, we learn of Sanjay's lethal estrangement from his best friend, Sikander, an Anglo-Indian warrior who serves the British; of the suicide of Sikander's mother, Janvi, who throws herself on a funeral pyre after her English husband gives away their daughters to missionaries; of Sanjay's avenging showdown in London with Dr. Paul Sarthey, renowned orientalist and murderous imperialist. Abhay also narrates his own sprawling tale about his drive across the U.S. with two alienated fellow students, providing a dramatic contrast between America's throwaway pop culture and India's ancient, venerated ways, bound up with the concepts of dharma (right conduct), karma and reincarnation.

Though Eli doesn&#x2019;t share his brother&#x2019;s appetite for whiskey and killing, he&#x2019;s never known anything else.

Based on extensive personal interviews with current and former agents and on material from the KGB archives, <i>The State Within a State</i> makes a compelling argument that the new incarnation of the KGB has grown not only in size but in influence since the fall of the Soviet Union, making it perhaps the most powerful political force in contemporary Russia.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian"Old spies never die; they just change their names" might have been the author's recoined motto for this indignant work. The Foreign Intelligence Service and the Federal Counterintelligence Service are the new shingles hanging outside the Lubyanka in Moscow, and journalist Albats, who earned a crusading reputation in a host of expos{&#x201a;}es about the previous tenant, the Committee for State Security, here piles up a mountainous indictment of the nominally defunct "Sword and Shield of the Revolution." Unfortunately for the casual reader, she details to a fault, and it's mainly those well versed in Soviet history who can digest her profiles (of a retired Chekist "investigator," that is, a torturer), feel her pain at documented cases of injustice (long excerpts provided), or evaluate her claim that secret police still infiltrate Russia's institutions, including the press. The fuel for her energetic anger, of course, is that no retribution has been, or is likely ever to be, visited on the executors of the Stalinist state, in contrast to certifiable Nazis, who notionally had to worry about being hauled before a court. Into that gap flow the ersatz tribunes of journalism, and however discursive this effort, its wrathfulness reveals what even average people had to confront in the KGB. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Vineyard Fear : A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery</h2><p><p>Escaping the city and its violence, ex-cop Jeff "J.

The Davis Autism Approach is uniquely geared to the autistic perspective, and enables each person to make sense of their world and the motivations and behaviors of others around them. This book explores the history of development of the Davis method, explores its connections to emerging scientific research, and takes the reader on a guided journey through the three phases of the program: Individuation, Identity Development, and Social Integration.</p><p>Abigail Marshall and Ronald Dell Davis are the authors of several books focused on dyslexia and learning. Ron Davis wrote &#34;The Gift of Dyslexia&#34; and &#34;The Gift of Learning.&#34; Abigail is the author of &#34;The Everything Parent&#39;s Guide to Children with Dyslexia&#34; and &#34;When Your Child Has Dyslexia.&#34; Abigail Marshall is a graduate of the University of California, and holds degrees in Applied Behavioral Sciences and Law. In addition to writing, she manages several educational and health web sites. Ron Davis was severely autistic as a child. He began to emerge from his void of isolation as a teenager. As an adult, he has been employed as an engineer, a businessman, and educator. He is married, and is father and grandfather. The program described in this book largely replicates the steps Ron took in learning to function within society. Abigail met Ron in 1994 when she was seeking help for her own son&#39;s dyslexia. She was astounded by her son&#39;s rapid success using the Davis techniques, and became fascinated with studying research developments in neuroscience in an effort to better understand the science that would validate the Davis theories.</p><h2>New Religious Movements: A Documentary Reader</h2><p><p><b>New Religious Movements</b> is a highly unique volume, bringing together primary documents conveying the words and ideas of a wide array of new religious movements (NRMs), and offering a first-hand look into their belief systems.<br> Arranged by the editors according to a new typology, the text allows readers to consider NRMS along five interrelated pathways&#x2014;from those that offer new perceptions of existence or new personal identities, to those that center on relationships within family-like units, to those movements that highlight the need for recasting the social order or anticipate the dawn of a new age.<br>The volume includes original documents from groups such as the Unification Church, Theosophy, Branch Davidians, Wicca, Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, Santeria, and Seventh Day Adventists, as well as many others.

Of The Babies, poet Claudia Rankine writes, &#x201c;Rarely do we encounter poems that are so precisely framed, though on their surface seemingly whimsical and erratic. These poems are gorgeous, intelligent, and disturbing.&#x201d;</p><p>SABRINA ORAH MARK was raised in Brooklyn, New York.

The vividness with which Orah Mark processes such chaos is exacting; however amplified, its pitch almost always feels authentic. --Diagram<br><br>And you think yes, how obvious, and then marvel at how something so obviously correct can also conceal such a terrible wrongness, a kind of cavalier terror. And this is the tone The Babies manages to capture and preserve. The literary eavesdropping here, the way in which Mark forces us to depend on what we do know and recognize only to transform and subvert that knowledge, also forces us to reconsider what can be known about any exchange, or any state as elusive yet undeniable as the one this book both memorializes and mimics. Like the blouses to which Mark repeatedly refers, blouses opened and buttoned again, sometimes loose and sometimes confining, these poems remain tatter and patch and scrap, but also become whole. --Constant Critic</p><h2>Pilates for the Dressage Rider</h2><p>While they use different terms, both Pilates and dressage share an emphasis on the torso, or "Powerhouse" in Pilates-speak, and achieving core strength, good posture, and muscle flexibility. The goals of a Pilates program are often identical to what riders try to achieved in the saddle in the sport of dressage. The book shares three basic goals: to give the reader an introduction to Pilates and basic workout to do at home or on the horse, to help the rider understand and gain control over the engagement of her own spine, and to guide the rider toward using the knowledge gained through the practice of Pilates to help her find new ways to use her body to improve her riding. The exercises in the book have been culled from the over 500 Pilates exercises and have been specifically chosen to best suit the needs of the dressage rider.

You don&#39;t know the Royal&#39;s history and successes until you know him. His name is Art Stewart and he helped bring Bo Jackson to the Royals on a hunch. He once signed a player after sneaking into the home and listening in on a rival&#39;s offer. He has the kind of charm that&#39;s overmatched highway patrolmen--Art has paid two speeding tickets in his life, and guesses that baseball stories have gotten him out of a dozen more. Once, his rental car running on fumes in Florida&#39;s Alligator Alley, Art told a few baseball stories and a man siphoned gas for him. He fell in love with baseball when he snuck into his attic and found his late father&#39;s baseball gloves, and his seven decades on the wild ride of major league baseball make him a living, breathing, storytelling personification of America&#39;s pastime. Art was born on Babe Ruth&#39;s 32nd birthday, and has been inside baseball through Ted Williams&#39; triple crown, Willie Mays&#39; catch, Hank Aaron&#39;s home runs, George Brett&#39;s chase of .400, all the way though the high-definition, instant-replay times of today. Art helped build the Yankees&#39; dynasty of the 1950s and 1960s, before becoming an integral part of making the Royals the most successful expansion franchise in baseball history. His aggressive ways are part of why baseball&#39;s owners voted overwhelmingly to institute a draft in 1963. Art signed one 20-game winner who shook the sport with an explosive book, and another 20-game winner who shook the sport by swapping wives with a teammate. From George Brett to Frank White, Bret Saberhagen to Bo Jackson, Carlos Beltran to Eric Hosmer, the Royals&#39; history is Art&#39;s history. Art just tells it better than anyone else.</p><p>The only scout ever inducted to the Royals&#39; Hall of Fame, Art has been an integral part of the franchise since 1969. He grew up on the North side of Chicago, walking distance from Wrigley Field, and ran his own semipro team before his 13th birthday. He was a good enough high school player that the Hall of Famer George Sisler offered him a pro contract with the Dodgers, but Art was making too much money hustling his semipro games to take the paycut. Instead, he kept the team and started scouting for the Yankees--going full-time in 1958. Stewart left the Yankees to help start the Royals, and was key component in everything the franchise did from the innovative Royals Academy to building an organizational strength that was the envy of the entire industry. One of the best-known scouts in baseball, Art is considered the model for generations of scouts who&#39;ve come up after him. He signed more than 70 players who made the big leagues, including Bo Jackson, Johnny Damon and Carlos Beltran. The Royals were named Major League Baseball Organization of the Year four times by various publications during Art&#39;s 12 years as director of scouting. Sam Mellinger has worked at The Kansas City Star since 2000, the last four years as sports columnist. His work has been recognized by the Associated Press Sports Editors, Kansas and Missouri Press Associations, and Best American Sports Writing. He lives in Kansas City with his wife Katie and son Samuel.Art was always there for me from day one when I signed with the Royals and he took me to Memphis to start my baseball career. I've never seen anyone who loved the game more. He gave his life to it. His wife, Donna, was like a second mother to me and I could always hear her voice even if there were 40,000 people in the stadium. --Bo Jackson, Royals All-Star, NFL Pro Bowler, Heisman Trophy winner, and ESPN Sports Science's greatest athlete of all time.<br><br>Art Stewart represents the greatest era in the baseball scouting profession. His expertise, experiences, and stories as a baseball man are to be cherished. He is simply loved and respected by all who know and work with him. --Dayton Moore, general manager of the Kansas City Royals<br><br>Art Stewart is an icon in the scouting world. Art is the ultimate pro. His focus during games, complete concentration, and knowing when to approach coaches and players after the game is a model for scouts young and old. Times have changed around him, but Art excels under any circumstance. His book is educational and entertaining on all levels. --Roland Hemmond, three-time MLB Executive of the Year winner and the first person other than the namesake to win the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award</p><h2>The Greatest Beach: A History of the Cape Cod National Seashore (Designing the American Park Ser.)</h2><p><p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Thoreau recognized the importance of preserving the complex and fragile landscape of Cape Cod, with its weathered windmills, expansive beaches, dunes, wetlands, harbors, and the lives that flourished here, supported by the maritime industries and saltworks. One hundred years later, the National Park Service&#x2015;working with a group of concerned locals, then-senator John F. Kennedy, and other supporters&#x2015;took on the challenge of meeting the needs of a burgeoning public in this region of unique natural beauty and cultural heritage.<br><br>To those who were settled in the remote wilds of the Cape, the impending development was threatening, and as the award-winning historian Ethan Carr explains, the visionary plan to create a national seashore came very close to failure. Success was achieved through unprecedented public outreach, as the National Park Service and like-minded Cape Codders worked to convince entire communities of the long-term value of a park that could accommodate millions of tourists. Years of contentious negotiations resulted in the innovative compromise between private and public interests now known as the &#x201c;Cape Cod model.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Greatest Beach</i> is essential reading for all who are concerned with protecting the nation&#x2019;s gradually diminishing cultural landscapes. In his final analysis of Cape Cod National Seashore, Carr poses provocative questions about how to balance the conservation of natural and cultural resources in regions threatened by increasing visitation and development.</p></p><p>How a renowned tourist destination became one of America&#x2019;s most beloved and influential national parksETHAN CARR, FASLA, is a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Massachusetts&#x2013;Amherst and an international authority on America&#x2019;s public landscapes.

Distance no longer defines who we meet, fall in love with or marry. The Internet and e-mail connect people around the world in seconds. Immigration, study abroad, travel and multinational business have created a thriving cross-cultural community. But the experiences shared across cultures and countries do not always bridge the fundamental differences in beliefs and behaviors that span diverse cultures.<br><br>In <i>Intercultural Marriage</i>, Dugan Romano delivers a "reality check" for anyone already in, or contemplating, an intercultural marriage. This insightful book interweaves lessons learned from others and suggests that the joys of an intercultural marriage often result from turning the challenges of crossing cultures into an opportunity for a fulfilling and lasting relationship. <br><br>Now in its third edition, <i>Intercultural Marriage</i> examines the impact of cultural differences in marriage and offers practical guidelines on how to deal with the complexities they bring to a partnership. Covering such topics as raising bicultural children, religion, values, male vs. female roles, sex and social class, Romano continues to give voice to hundreds of couples she has interviewed and followed for over a decade.</p><p>Dugan Romano has been a cross-cultural trainer and counselor for fifteen years.Invaluable for anyone contemplating or having already plunged into cross-border wedlock.&#x2015;<b>Richard Richter, founding president of Radio Free Asia</b><br><br>If you are thinking about marrying someone from another culture, or have a friend or family member doing so, this book should be required reading.&#x2015;<b>Chester Gillis, professor of Theology and Amaturo Chair in Catholic Studies, Georgetown University</b></p><h2>Cole Porter</h2><p>In his life and in his music, Cole Porter was the top&#x2014;the pinnacle of wit and sophistication. From the 1910s through the &#x2018;50s, from Yale pep rallies through the Broadway triumphs of <i>Anything Goes</i> and <i>Kiss Me, Kate</i>, he delighted audiences with a glittering torrent of song: &#x201c;I Get a Kick Out of You.&#x201d; &#x201c;Night and Day,&#x201d; &#x201c;Love for Sale,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Just One of Those Things.&#x201d; The bright surface of these gems&#x2014;their catchy melodies and ingenious lyrics&#x2014;made them instant pop hits. Their more subtle qualities and their musical and emotional depth have made them lasting standards, among the greatest glories of the American songbook.<br> &nbsp;<br> In<i> Cole Porter</i>, William McBrien has thoroughly captured the creator of these songs, whose life was one not only of wealth and privilege but also of tragedy, secrecy, and courage. A prodigal young man, Porter found his aesthetic and emotional anchor in a long, loving, if sexless marriage, while continuing to maintain many discreet affairs with men. In 1937, at the height of his success, he suffered a near-fatal riding accident; his last eighteen years were marked by pain, drugs, and repeated operations on his legs, years of physical agony but unstinting artistic achievement. Here is the book that Porter&#x2019;s fans have long hoped for&#x2014;a life that informs the great music and lyrics though illuminating glimpses of the hidden, complicated, private man.</p><p>It's not quite as witty as a Porter song (who could equal the incomparable Cole?), but this thorough biography honors the Broadway musical's worldliest, most intelligent composer by taking him seriously. Voluminous research buttresses William McBrien's portrait of a charmed life scarred by tragedy. Born in 1891, Porter left his wealthy family in Indiana to thoroughly enjoy himself at Yale University in Connecticut, where his sassy songs gave the Midwestern outsider social clout. Although exclusively homosexual, Porter was nonetheless devoted to the wealthy widow he married in 1919, and McBrien's narrative of their 1920s travels through Europe captures the glamorous sheen of their life together. Porter had some early success with shows like <i>Fifty Million Frenchmen</i>, but his sustained run of hits began in 1932 with <i>Gay Divorce</i>, continuing through the '50s and <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>. The author liberally quotes from Porter's deliciously naughty lyrics, reminding us how corny most show tunes seem when compared to "Love for Sale" or "Anything Goes." McBrien's painful account of the ghastly aftermath of a 1937 riding accident, which left Porter in pain that ended only with his death in 1964, reveals a quiet, uncomplaining stoic whose substance matched his dazzling style. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"A complex and groundbreaking portrait...making use of previously unpublished material...Never-before-seen letters shine light into Porter's ongoing relationships"<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><p>"Read this book...You will spend time with, and get to know, one of the great creative figures of the twentieth century."<br>--Betty Comden, <i>The New York Observer</i></p><p>"Loaded with juicy gossip...He succeeds in evoking Porter's white-tie-and-orchids set.

Four friends: a class clown who stoops very low for a laugh; a confused artist enthralled by guitar rock; an earnest radical with socialist leanings; and a quiet dreamer obsessed with poetry, God, and the prettiest girl in school. As the world appears to self-destruct around them, they hold together to navigate the choppy waters of a decidedly ambiguous decade.</p><p>At a time when people are looking back on the 1970s with nostalgia, Jonathan Coe's <i>The Rotters' Club</i> is a timely reminder of how ghastly that benighted decade was in Britain. Set in the "industrial" heartland of the West Midlands, it chronicles the growing pains of four Brummie schoolboys--Philip, Sean, Doug, and Benjamin--who must come to terms not only with the normal pangs of adolescence but with terrible knitwear, ludicrous pop music, nightmarish food, and insidious racism, all set against the awful, surreal, and tragicomic reality of a postimperial nation.<p> The book suffers in its programmatic attempts to make the four boys and their families symbolize, or represent, something important to do with British life. Doug, for instance, symbolizes Industrial Decline--his dad is a shop steward at the doomed British Leyland Longbridge plant. Sean symbolizes Sexual Liberation--at least he's the one who seems most likely to get his rocks off. And young Ben Trotter would appear to represent A Young Jonathan Coe. But if this aspect of the novel seems contrived, then the author's capricious, deft, wryly comedic, and touchingly empathetic style keeps things chugging along, as he knits together the troubles and tragedies of some fairly ordinary people living through fairly extraordinary years. <i>--Sean Thomas, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>&#x201c;Reflective and compelling, satirical and tender, wildly imaginative and painstakingly realistic.&#x201d; &#x2013;Chris Lehmann,<i> The Washington Post Book World<br><br></i>&#x201c;The gritty, cross-pond equivalent to <b>Look Homeward, Angel</b>. . . .

A student of theosophy who became the head of anthroposophy, his works were profuse, but among all of these, &#34;Occult Significance of Blood&#34; stands out as perhaps the best. Speaking of interbreeding and the spiritual result, the race question (then in vogue in philosophical circles) and the biological concept of blood in general, Steiner&#39;s work is highly indicative of its date of origin and symbolizes the confusion of the 1910s.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.Rudolf Steiner (1861 1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up. As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland. <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><h2>Christ&#39;s Samurai</h2><p><p>The sect was said to harbour dark designs to overthrow the government.

When she meets and marries handsome, successful Anthony Fleming, the charismatic man of her dreams, she believes her life is destined for happiness. She and her children move into her new husband&#x2019;s spacious apartment in the legendary Rockwell on Central Park West. Despite her son&#x2019;s instinctive misgivings about the building and its residents, Caroline dismisses the odd behavior of her neighbors as pleasant eccentricities. But after her daughter begins to experience horrifying nightmares and a startling secret emerges, Caroline realizes that the magnificence of her new home masks a secret of unimaginable horror. . . .</p><p>In a <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> meets <i>Hansel and Gretel</i> thriller, John Saul's <i>Midnight Voices</i> is packed with bump-in-the-night chills that will frighten and delight readers with its nostalgic nod to urban legends and campfire tales. With short, edgy chapters and all-too-vivid imagery, <i>Midnight Voices</i> begs to be enjoyed in one sitting, in the dark, huddled on the corner of your couch. As usual in Saul's world, strange things are afoot in the city, and the Evans family is the target. <p> At the heart of this spooky tale are the children, Laurie and Ryan Evans, who are unwittingly exposed to danger when their recently widowed mother marries widower Anthony Fleming. The too-good-to-be-anything-but-evil Fleming lives in the Rockwell, a building rumored to be inhabited by witches and vampires, that has the children in the neighborhood terrified:</p><p> </p><blockquote> "Amber's eyes were still fixed on the building. They were just stories, she told herself once again. They weren't true. But even as she silently spoke the words to herself, a strange chill of apprehension ran through her and she turned away ... I'll die, she thought. If I go in there, I'll die." </blockquote><p> Of course, the newly married Caroline does not share the anxiety of her children, despite Fleming's Bluebeard-like determination to keep everyone out of his study, not to mention the horrible whispers and strange sounds coming from empty rooms in the middle of the night. It is this tension, and Caroline's dawning realization of her new husband's shortcomings, that drives the novel to its startling conclusion. </p><p> Saul uses familiar horror images--an ancient building with even older residents, creepy neighbors that are not quite right, whispers in your room after midnight--to spin a new tale of evil that will remind readers why one should always leave the closet light on. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p><b>JOHN</b> <b>SAUL</b>&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Suffer the Children</i>, published in 1977, was an immediate million-copy bestseller.

Freshly illustrated and reissued as an early chapter book, these stories are perfect for newly independent readers.</p><br> <p>In <em>Coyote Sings to the Moon</em>, Coyote is at first the cause of misfortune. In those days, when the moon was much brighter and closer to the earth, Old Woman and the animals would sing to her each night. Coyote attempts to join them, but his voice is so terrible they beg him to stop. He is crushed and lashes out &#x2014; who needs Moon anyway? Furious, Moon dives into a pond, plunging the world into darkness. But clever Old Woman comes up with a plan to send Moon back up into the sky and, thanks to Coyote, there she stays.</p><br> <p>In <em>Coyote&#x2019;s New Suit</em>, mischievous Raven wreaks havoc when she suggests that Coyote&#x2019;s toasty brown suit is not the finest in the forest, thus prompting him to steal suits belonging to all the other animals. Meanwhile, Raven tells the other animals to borrow clothes from the humans&#x2019; camp. When Coyote finds that his closet is too full, Raven slyly suggests he hold a yard sale, then sends the human beings (in their underwear) and the animals (in their ill-fitting human clothes) along for the fun. A hilarious illustration of the consequences of wanting more than we need.</p></p><p><p>Thomas King has written several highly acclaimed children&#x2019;s books. <em>A Coyote Solstice Tale</em>, illustrated by Gary Clement, won the American Indian Library Association Youth Literature Award for Best Picture Book and <em>A Coyote Columbus Story</em>, illustrated by William Kent Monkman, was a Governor General&#x2019;s Award finalist.</p> <p>King, who is of Cherokee and Greek descent, was a Professor of English at the University of Guelph for many years, where he taught Native Literature and Creative Writing.

No!&#x201d; shout all the animals. &#x201c;You have a terrible singing voice!&#x201d;</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; says Old Woman. &#x201c;Your voice could scare Moon away.&#x201d;</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Hummph,&#x201d; says Coyote, whose feelings are hurt. &#x201c;Why would anyone want to sing to Moon, anyway?&#x201d;</p><br> <p><br> <strong>Excerpt from <em>Coyote&#x2019;s New Suit</em>:</strong><br> </p><br> <p>Just then Bear came out of the woods, all hot and sweaty. She took off her bear suit, folded it up neatly and left it on a large, flat rock.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Wheeeeeee!&#x201d; she shouted as she hopped into the pond. She waved her arms and kicked her legs and splashed water all over the place.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s a suit,&#x201d; said Raven, eyeing Bear&#x2019;s suit as it lay on the rock. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;ve seen a suit like that in my entire life.&#x201d; And she flew away.</p><br> <p>But she didn&#x2019;t go far.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Hummmph!&#x201d; grumped Coyote. &#x201c;What does Raven know about fashion?&#x201d;</p><br> <p>But he had to admit that Bear&#x2019;s suit did look substantial. When no one was looking, he tiptoed over and held the suit up to the light, rubbing his nose in the thick fur.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as classy as my suit, but it certainly is impressive.&#x201d;</p><br> <p>Then Coyote had an idea. It wasn&#x2019;t a good idea, but then most of Coyote&#x2019;s ideas weren&#x2019;t.</p></p><h2>Broken Places (A Chicago Mystery)</h2><p><b>Cops can make mistakes, even when they&#x2019;re not rookies. If anyone knows that it&#x2019;s Cass Raines.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Cass took a bullet two years ago after an incompetent colleague screwed up a tense confrontation with an armed suspect. Deeply traumatized, Cass resigned from the Chicago PD, leaving one less female African-American on the force. Now she&#x2019;s the head of a one-woman private investigation agency, taking on just enough work to pay the bills. But when the only father figure she&#x2019;s ever known, Father Ray Heaton, asks her to look into a recent spate of vandalism at his church, she readily agrees to handle it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Only hours later Cass is horrified to discover Father Ray&#x2019;s murdered body in the church confessional, a dead gangbanger sprawled out nearby. She knew Pop, as she called him, had ticked off plenty of people, from slumlords to politicians, with his uncompromising defense of the downtrodden. But a late-night random theft doesn&#x2019;t seem like much of a motive at a cash-strapped parish. The lead detective assigned to the case is all too eager to dismiss it as a burglary gone awry, just another statistic in a violent city. But Cass&#x2019;s instincts tell her otherwise, and badge or no badge, she intends to see justice done . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;An exciting new character-driven series.&#x201d;</b><br><b><i>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><p><b>Tracy Clark&nbsp;</b>is the author of the highly acclaimed Chicago Mystery Series featuring ex-homicide cop turned PI Cassandra Raines, a hard-driving, African-American protagonist who works the mean streets of the Windy City dodging cops, cons, killers, and thugs.

As Dr. Hank Wesselman explains, our search for objective knowledge has come at the cost of a deeper, intuitive rapport with nature and our spiritual selves. The result is a profound disenchantment, one that affects us individually and collectively. What we need now is a "re-enchantment"&#x2015;a way to renew our relationship with nature, reawaken to spiritual reality, and reclaim the sense of connection and hope that gives meaning to our lives.</p><p><i>The Re-Enchantment</i> offers a compelling blueprint for the emerging transformational spirituality&#x2015;not a return to the superstition and ignorance of old beliefs, but a "modern upgrade of the path of the shaman" that reconnects us to our inner sources of intuition, power, and healing. Here he explores:</p><p> � Challenging the cultural mythos&#x2015;why a new story is arising about who we are and where we fit in to the greater whole<br> � The role of the shaman as a mediator between the material and spiritual worlds<br> � Guides, helping spirits, oversouls, and masters of deception&#x2015;unseen spiritual forces that influence our lives<br> � Empowering ourselves to be agents of change through the shamanic path of "direct revelation"</p><p> "There is new spiritual complex coming into being in our world," writes Dr. Wesselman. "This mystical mosaic draws from many traditions and many cultures, and has the potential to refresh and perhaps replace our current mainstream religions with new perceptions and new insights." With <i>The Re-Enchantment, </i>this leading teacher presents a provocative call to action&#x2015;to engage the world with a newborn&#x2019;s eyes, a shaman&#x2019;s heart, and soul dedicated to a wiser, more compassionate future.</p></p><p><p><b>Hank Wesselman</b><br><b>Hank Wesselman, PhD</b>, is a paleoanthropologist and shamanic teacher who has worked with noted anthropologists investigating the mysteries of human origins in Africa. His books include <i>Visionseeker</i>, <i>Spiritwalker</i>, and <i>Journey to the Sacred Garden</i>. He lives in Hawaii.</p><p>&#x201c;Wesselman (The Spiritwalker Trilogy), a paleoanthropologist and shamanic teacher with decades of experience in both fields, constructs an antidote to the 'profound disenchantment' that plagues many people today. The author sets the stage for readers&#x2019; 're-enchantment' by telling the tale of his own, involving an improbable vision and a series of lucid dreams he had while on a dig in Ethiopia&#x2019;s Lower Omo Valley in the 1970s. This experience inspired him to pursue a shamanic path. In a tone that&#x2019;s equal parts memoir and science report, the author renders fantastical events plausible, tantalizing spiritual seekers with the idea that each of us has the potential to expand our consciousness and engage with what Wesselman calls the Mystery, an 'elusive presence' that may 'draw us forward toward that which we are destined to become.' An openness to the Mystery, a willingness to quiet oneself, and the intention to focus on inner worlds and hidden realms are all components of the shamanic path, which, according to Wesselman, will balance one&#x2019;s body, mind, and spirit. He reminds readers that their shamanic paths should benefit others as well, by healing and empowering the people around us. Aside from the amazing anecdotes the author shares, his calm voice, positive attitude, and insistence on kindness towards people and spirits are truly enchanting.&#x201d; &#x2015;Publishers Weekly</p><p>&#x201c;One of the curses of our modern world is the assumption that we must choose between science and spirituality, reason and intuition, objectivity and subjectivity. This false choice has led us to a critical threshold in which it is uncertain whether our species will survive. That is why Dr. Hank Wesselman&#x2019;s vision is so important. [His] personal experiences and vision transcend the suffocating limitations of materialism that now threaten our future . . . If we respond to Dr. Wesselman's message, we humans will not only survive, but thrive.&#x201d; &#x2015;Larry Dossey, MD, author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It Matters</p><p>&#x201c;In The Re-Enchantment, Hank Wesselman grabs us by the hand, pulls us out of the seat of the ordinary, and guides us far enough into the Otherworld to glimpse the incredible mysteries that he experienced. Through stunning stories and uncanny synchronicities Hank invites us into a tale of power and recovery you have to read to believe. This is not a scholar&#x2019;s book with a thousand footnotes, but an adventurer&#x2019;s log, intended to inspire the young and curious, as well as the seasoned healer or adventurer. I could hardly put it down. This artful book by a real master belongs in the backpacks of every college-age person the way Carlos Castaneda&#x2019;s books once did for our generation. It deserves that kind of impact, and it is so needed today, as we face a planetary crisis and need a spiritual vision to live by that can help us navigate the challenges facing us.&#x201d; &#x2015;C. Michael Smith, PhD, author of Jung and Shamanism in Dialogue: Retrieving the Soul/Retrieving the Sacred; director of Crows Nest Centers International</p><p>&#x201c;Hank Wesselman is a genuine and engaging story teller who blends his scientific wisdom with his experience with shamanism from a place of heart. In The Re-Enchantment, Hank shares a wealth of insights about how shamanism in the West is being changed and reformed by the times and the culture in which we live. Hank is courageous and touches on subjects from which other authors have shied away. He has created an important book for modern day shamanic practitioners and vision seekers alike. It is brilliantly written and has given me lots to ponder on. The Re-Enchantment is a book to be savored and to be read more than once.&#x201d; &#x2015;Sandra Ingerman, MA, author of Soul Retrieval and Walking in Light: The Everyday Empowerment of Shamanic Life; coauthor (with Hank Wesselman) of the award-winning Awakening to the Spirit World: The Shamanic Path of Direct Revelation.</p><p>&#x201c;As the scientific method has been transformed by quantum physics, the shaman&#x2019;s path of direct revelation is rising from the ashes and is being reworked into a new form enabling todays&#x2019; spiritual seekers to unfold in their quintessential adventure of self-discovery and personal transformation. Prying open the doors of perception of the inner worlds, Dr. Hank Wesselman nimbly gifts us with glimpses into the panorama of the great mystery. As a scientist, shamanist, and seer, he combines the genius and discipline of scholarly explorations found in the contributions of Joseph Campbell, Lewis Hyde, Michael Harner, and Vine Deloria. This book reminds each of us that our spiritual journey is an expanding fractal mirror of the holographic universe. The Re-Enchantment provides us with guideposts to authentic emergent grace&#x2015;encouraging us to walk through those ancient misty doors of authentic initiation yet once again.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nan Moss, shamanic teacher and practitioner and author of Weather Shamanism: Harmonizing Our Connection with the Elements</p><p>&#x201c;We are living in a time when the materialist world order and the human obsessions with manipulation, profit, and war have brought our civilization to the raw edge of global catastrophe. Into that perfect storm come voices that urge us to remember what we once knew&#x2015;what shamans and gnostics and the mystics of antiquity taught. Hank Wesselman is such a voice. Trained in the detailed observational skills of a physical anthropologist, gifted with clairvoyant vision into the corridors of deep time, apprenticed to the wisdom teachings of the Hawaiian kahuna, he reminds us of the sacredness of nature and of our personal connection with the spiritual dimensions of life on Earth. He calls this book a &#x2018;manifesto.&#x2019; It is indeed a clarion call to turn away from the madness of self-destruction and to practice again the ways of re-connection and re-enchantment.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ralph Metzner, PhD, author of The Well of Remembrance and Green Psychology.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Hank Wesselman has written an impassioned call for everyone to step onto a visionary path similar to that of our indigenous ancestors who saw reality as a complex mosaic of outer experiences and inner mysteries. He reminds us that our galaxy is one among uncountable millions of galaxies, and that as our small planet rebalances itself for its survival, so must we. If you have felt that something is missing in our endless discussions of what's wrong in our world, you may be feeling the need that Dr. Wesselman presents so convincingly&#x2015;to re-enchant both nature and ourselves, to embrace the new mysteries coming into being and to overcome our spiritual blindness.&#x201d; &#x2015;Tom Cowan, author of Fire in the Head: Shamanism and the Celtic Spirit and Yearning for the Wind: Celtic Reflections on Nature and the Soul.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Hank Wesselman has written a provocative book on how we as spiritual beings put reality together with luminosity and with a new vision. To me, a book is a promise to readers that your integrity as a writer will be impeccable. Dr. Wesselman has kept his promise.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lynn Andrews, author of the New York Times and internationally bestselling Medicine Woman Series</p><p>&#x201c;In The Re-Enchantment, Hank Wesselman helps us to find songlines for our modern lives. Drawing on a lifetime of scholarship and deep shamanic practice, he invites us to follow a path of direct experience of the sacred. He is candid about the price to be paid to install oneself in "the seat of initiation", but he gives us many reasons to move beyond our comfort zone and re-enchant our world through conscious connection with the powers of nature and the world-behind-the-world. Boldly, he offers a template for a new mythos, affirming that the greater powers do not require us to follow hand-me-down beliefs, but instead to become co-creators. You'll be thrilled by his accounts of his personal awakenings to the deeper reality.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robert Moss, bestselling author of Conscious Dreaming, The Secret History of Dreaming, and The Boy Who Died and Came Back</p><p>&#x201c;The Re-Enchantment is full of magic, insight, and profound realizations about the nature of spirit and life.

Anita Anand has been a radio and television journalist in Britain for over twenty years, presenting major programmes on BBC. Her first book, Sophia: Princess, Suffragette, Revolutionary, is a highly acclaimed biography of the daughter of Maharaja Duleep Singh, the last ruler of Punjab, who was forced to hand over the Koh-i-Noor to the British after they annexed his kingdom in 1849.For all those who who hated history at school, this is going to change your perception of the same. In the introduction, the narrator tells us briefly about how the Koh-i-Noor got into the hands of the East India Company and how it rests in England now.

Cultural Techniques aims to forget our traditional understanding of media so as to redefine the concept through something more fundamental than the empiricist study of a medium&#x2019;s individual or collective uses or of its cultural semantics or aesthetics. Rather, Siegert seeks to relocate media and culture on a level where the distinctions between object and performance, matter and form, human and nonhuman, sign and channel, the symbolic and the real are still in the process of becoming. The result is to turn ontology into a domain of all that is meant in German by the word Kultur.</p><p>Cultural techniques comprise not only self-referential symbolic practices like reading, writing, counting, or image-making. The analysis of artifacts as cultural techniques emphasizes their ontological status as &#x201c;in-betweens,&#x201d; shifting from firstorder to second-order techniques, from the technical to the artistic, from object to sign, from the natural to the cultural, from the operational to the representational.</p><p>Cultural Techniques ranges from seafaring, drafting, and eating to the production of the sign-signaldistinction in old and new media, to the reproduction of anthropological difference, to the study of trompe-l&#x2019;oeils, grids, registers, and doors. Throughout, Siegert addresses fundamental questions of how ontological distinctions can be replaced by chains of operations that process those alleged ontological distinctions within the ontic.</p><p>Grounding posthumanist theory both historically and technically, this book opens up a crucial dialogue between new German media theory and American postcybernetic discourses.</p></p><p>BERNHARD SIEGERT is Gerd Bucerius Professsor of the History and Theory of Cultural Techniques at the Bauhaus Universitat Weimar and Director of the International Research Center for Cultural Techniques and Media Philosophy at Weimar. Together with Friedrich Kittler, Norbert Bolz, and Wolfgang Coy, he is one of the pioneers of German media theory. He is the author of Relays: Literature as an Epoch of the Postal System.<br><br>GEOFFREY WINTHROP-YOUNG is Professor of German at the Department of Central, Eastern and Northern European Studies at the University of British Columbia.&#x201c;Cultural Techniques displays a stunning amount of historical knowledge, exploring texts and technological innovations that fall into fields such as the history of science, art history, architecture, cultural anthropology, ethnology, literary studies, and philosophy. . . Highly important.&#x201d; (&#x2015;Edgar Landgraf <i>Bowling Green State University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Siegert&#x2019;s case studies suggest that human being (Dasein) articulates itself through a strife inherent in the play of ontological difference. This strife demands the construction of distinctions that produce human identity and cultural differences. Siegert assigns the name 'cultural techniques' to this production and maintenance of difference. . . . Cultural Techniques suggests that every technical advance consolidates and reproduces new ensembles of cultural difference. Here, life itself is lodged within a system of differences that defy resolution and remain perpetually open to strategic redistribution.&#x201d; (<i>&#x2015;Bernard Dionysius Geoghegan, Paragraph</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An excellent collection of essays from one of the most widely known and respected scholars of media, media theory, and cultural techniques working in Germany.

Reference. W. M. Thackston&#39;s AN INTRODUCTION TO KORANIC AND CLASSICAL ARABIC is an elementary-level grammar of standard classical Arabic, the literary norm of the Arabic language that has not changed appreciably in fourteen hundred years. An indispensable tool for all who are interested in Islamic religion, science, and literature, the language presented in this book will enable the learner to study firsthand the primary sources of Islamic civilization and the classics of the Islamic Near East. W. M. Thackston is Professor of the Practice in Persian and Other Near Eastern Languages at Harvard University, where he has taught Persian and Arabic for over twenty years. Author of numerous books and articles on the languages and literatures of the Near East, his works include a new English translation of the Baburnama, A Century of Princes: Sources on Timurid History and Art, and Tales from Luristan: Tales, Fables and Folk Poetry from the Lur of Bala-Gariva.</p><p>Thackston's textbook is the most recent addition to Arabic instructional materials. It is perhaps the friendliest Western grammar of Arabic. Its grammatical explanations are lucid and concise, yet they provide a complete, adequate description of a basic grammar of Arabic. The book comprises a preface, a chapter on preliminary matters, 40 lessons, supplementary readings from the Koran (Qur'an ? the holy book of Muslims) and hadith literature (traditions of the prophet Muhammad), 10 appendixes, English-Arabic and Arabic-English glossaries, an index of verb and derivational patterns (56 of them), and a general index. All the lessons have one consistent design: Each one is subdivided into sections and subsections. The explanations are accompanied by numerous examples. Each lesson concludes with a vocabulary list and two types of exercises: grammatical manipulation (providing case and mood endings) and translation. <p>As a textbook, this work is particularly useful in programs where a reading proficiency of the Koran and hadith is desirable within a relatively short period of time, given that the students already have a reasonable grasp of Arabic structures and vocabulary. Overall, it is a very well designed book of basic grammar that can serve as a useful supplement for intermediate and advanced students of Arabic in various programs. --<i>Mahdi Alosh, Modern Language Journal</i></p></p><h2>A History of Scotland (Penguin History)</h2><p>A history that is equally entertaining and enlightening, illustrating all of the changes of power and intricacies that are necessary to understand the interrelation between England and Scotland and the Highland and Lowland populations.

Corral, and the Vendetta Ride 1881&#x2013;82 (Raid)</h2><p><p>The Gunfight at the OK Corral on 26 October 1881 is one of the most enduring stories of the Old West. It led to a series of violent incidents that culminated in the Vendetta Ride, in which Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and several other gunslingers went after their rivals the Cowboys.</p><p>Like most tales of the Wild West, the facts are buried under layers of myth, and the line between good guys and bad guys is blurry. Wyatt Earp, leader of the so-called "good guys", was charged with stealing horses in the Indian Territory in 1870 and jumped bail. Becoming a buffalo hunter and gambler, he got into several scrapes and earned a reputation as a gunfighter. Several times he helped lawmen arrest outlaws, but usually his assistance came more because of a personal grudge against the criminal than any real respect for law and order. He even got fired from a police job in Wichita for beating up a political rival. </p><p>So it was in Tombstone. He settled there in 1879 along his three brothers and "Doc" Holliday. Virgil and Morgan Earp worked as lawmen. As the Earps became a power in the town, investing in some businesses and starting others, they were soon at loggerheads with the Clanton Gang, the so-called "Cowboys." In that time and place, honest cowboys called themselves "ranchers" and the term "cowboy" was reserved for rustlers and other unsavory characters.</p><p>The Tombstone Cowboys had Cochise County sheriff John Behan in their pocket and the struggle between the Earps and Cowboys was partially a political rivalry. It was also because the Earps had invested in the stagecoaches and the Cowboys liked to rob them. There was an element of lingering differences over the Civil War as well, something common in Wild West feuds. The Earps and friends were mostly Republican Northerners, while the Cowboys were mostly Democrats and former Confederates. This distinction wasn't clear cut, however, as at least one Confederate veteran rode with the Earps. </p><p>Brawls and threats between the two sides became more frequent and culminated in a showdown near the OK Corral. Several Cowboys were loitering around hoping to attack Doc Holliday, so the Earps and Holliday decided to arrest them on the grounds that they were carrying weapons in town. In the shootout three Cowboys were killed and Virgil and Morgan Earp wounded.</p><p>The Cowboys thirsted for revenge and shot Morgan Earp in the back five months later. Virgil was crippled in a separate shooting. Taking Morgan's body to Tucson, the surviving Earp brothers and Holliday spotted Frank Stillwell, one of the Cowboys suspected of murdering Morgan. They shot him down. A large posse under John Behan, including many Cowboys, chased after the Earps but never caught them.</p></p><p>Sean McLachlan worked for ten years as an archaeologist before becoming a full-time writer.

This time, with a witness willing to testify, prosecutors believed they had a foolproof case. But the mob was difficult to catch for more reasons than one--a strict code of silence, witnesses who turned up dead, and cops and even judges under their control. Bob Lowe, the lone witness to the murder Aleman was tried for, learned this the hard way. Aleman was acquitted the first time around, and wasn't retried (and convicted) until 20 years later. Meanwhile, Lowe and his family were forced to go into hiding not once but twice, and their lives were destroyed. Veteran <i>Chicago Tribune</i> writers Maurice Possley and Rick Kogan have written a searing portrayal of the mob's skewed moral universe, the legal system it corrupted, and a witness-protection system riddled with flaws.

Genesis-Revelation 365 Daily Devotional: Come alongside Pastor Chuck as he takes us on a journey from Genesis to Revelation. Providing God&#39;s wisdom for our lives in this 365-daily devotional, discover how the Bible speaks volumes of wisdom to us every day. The world in which we live places great value on knowledge. But people don t always strive to know the most important things. The truth is you may be extremely knowledgeable about insects, or stars, or the sciences. You may be very wise about those sorts of things and people might really admire you for that knowledge. That s all well and good, but if you don t have the wisdom of God, you re missing the most important knowledge a man can ever hope to attain.</p><p>In 1965 Pastor Chuck Smith started his ministry at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa. Beginning with a mere 25 people, he saw God bless his simple, yet consistent style of teaching straight through the Bible. Today Calvary Chapel draws over 20,000 attendees weekly. With a genuine heart for the lost, Pastor Chuck made room in his ministry for a generation of hippies, surfers, and drug addicts. This generated a stirring of the Holy Spirit which spread from the California coast to the Atlantic and beyond. This movement was instrumental in bringing thousands of young people to Jesus Christ during the 60s and 70s in what was known as the Jesus People Movement. As God expanded his ministry, Pastor Chuck s visionary leadership saw the birth of other ministries such as: The Word for Today, a publishing/radio broadcasting ministry which is heard worldwide; Calvary Distribution, a wholesale Christian book and resource distributor; and Calvary Chapel Outreach Fellowship, an international organization with over 1,500 Calvary Chapels participating.

Climate change, together with global food, water, and resource shortages, are only the start.<br><br>Mander draws attention to capitalism&#x2019;s obsessive need to dominate and undermine democracy, as well as to diminish social and economic equity. Designed to operate free of morality,&#x201d; the system promotes permanent war&#x201d; as a key economic strategy. Worst of all, the problems of capitalism are intrinsic to the form. Many organizations are already anticipating the breakdown of the system and are working to define new hierarchies of democratic values that respect the carrying capacities of the planet.</p><p>Called the the patriarch of the anti-Globalization movement by <i>The New York Times</i>, Jerry Mander was Founder and is a Distinguished Fellow of the International Forum on Globalization. He also spent 15 years in the advertising business as president of Freeman, Mander &amp; Gossage, including producing the famous Sierra Club campaigns of the 1960s that saved the Grand Canyon. He has BS and MS degrees in international economics, and he lives in Northern California.Praise for <i>The Capitalism Papers</i><br><br>"In Mander's provocative newest, the environmentalist, social critic, and author of <i>1977's Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television</i> predicts the impending failure of the capitalist "experiment," one based on infinite expansion and unable to meet the challenges of climate change, peak oil, finite resources, and a rising global population. Mander lambasts the "intrinsic amorality" of capitalism, arguing that its focus on amassing wealth at any cost has abetted the rise of the incredibly lucrative military-industrial complex, and the practice of "so-called democratic governments catering to and facilitating the interests of the ultra-rich." Arguing that "cooperation must replace competition," Mander's concerns transcend party lines and established ideologies. As such, he closes with a compelling discussion of four ideas that he believes might blaze a trail away from capitalism and toward sustainable economic models: he suggests a refocusing on the limits of our planet, an emphasis on localization (as opposed to globalization), improved corporate structures, and a dismissal of the current black-and-white notion of capitalism vs. socialism. Refreshing and informative, these papers are a cogent rally cry and eloquent assessment of America's--and the world's--current predicament, dismal prospects, and hope for a way out." <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> This is a bold, much-needed book. On a subject where others are too often abstract or strident, Jerry Mander writes with a down-to-earth common-sense wisdom. I particularly like the way he weaves together his own experience in business and advertising with a large-spirited awareness of so many dimensions of the fragile planet we live on.&#x201d; Adam Hochschild, author of <i>King Leopold&#x2019;s Ghost</i><br><br>"Jerry Mander's <i>The Capitalism Papers</i> is a book of astonishing clarity and all-too-rare honesty. In an age where our major institutions are in collapse as our environment crumbles, and in which there is no apparent relief on the horizon, Mander has the courage to say that the emperor has no clothes; that the profit-obsessed economic system we are expected to swear loyalty to has its best days in its rear-view mirror. The implications are revolutionary." Robert McChesney, author of <i>Rich Media, Poor Democracy Communication Politics in Dubious Times</i><br><br> Capitalism's days are numbered but few have the courage to say so. Jerry Mander has both the courage and insight to put the case before us, and he does it brilliantly and movingly. There is hope for this planet and our future, Mander argues, but only if we are honest enough to admit that the experiment in unregulated market capitalism has failed and it is time to move beyond it.&#x201d; Maude Barlow, author of <i>Blue Covenant: The Global Water Crisis and the Coming Battle for the Right to Water</i><br><br>"Written in accessible language, and packed with real-life example. Point by point, Mander explains why capitalism can no longer serve people or the planet. And he leads us to a set of principles on which we can build a new economy for the 21st century and beyond." Anne Leonard, author <i>Story of Stuff</i><br><br>"This is a big book in terms of ideas, scope, and depth.

But the savage murder of a local journalist is the catalyst for a lethal series of events that shatters the calm of a picturesque Cornwall village and embroils Lynley and St. James in a case far outside their jurisdiction&#x2014;and a little too close to home. When a second death follows closely on the heels of the first, Lynley finds he can't help taking the investigation personally&#x2014;because the evidence points to a killer within his own family.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>"George is a master...an outstanding practitioner of the modern English mystery." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i><p> "Ms. George proves that the classiest crime writers are true novelists."<br><i>--The New York Times</i></p><p>"Ms. George can do it all, with style to spare."<br><i>--The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"A master of the modern English mystery."<br><i>--Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p></p>Elizabeth George&#x2019;s first novel, <b>A Great Deliverance</b>, was honored with the Anthony and Agatha Best First Novel Awards and received the Grand Prix de Litt�rature Polici�re.

Within a few short weeks, the fit forty-three-year-old lay gaunt, bald, and dying in a hospital, the victim of a "tiny nuclear bomb." Suspicions swirled around Russia's FSB, the successor to the KGB, and the Putin regime. Traces of polonium radiation were found in Germany and on certain airplanes, suggesting a travel route from Russia for the carriers of the fatal poison. But what really happened? What did Litvinenko know? And why was he killed? <br> <br> The full story of Sasha Litvinenko's life and death is one that the Kremlin does not want told. His closest friend, Alex Goldfarb, and his widow, Marina, are the only two people who can tell it all, from firsthand knowledge, with dramatic scenes from Moscow to London to Washington. <i>Death of a Dissident</i> reads like a political thriller, yet its story is more fantastic and frightening than any novel. <br> <br> Ever since 1998, when Litvinenko denounced the FSB for ordering him to assassinate tycoon Boris Berezovsky, he had devoted his life to exposing the FSB's darkest secrets. After a dramatic escape to London with Goldfarb's assistance, he spent six years, often working with Goldfarb, investigating a widening series of scandals. Oligarchs and journalists have been assassinated. Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yuschenko was poisoned on the campaign trail. The war in Chechnya became unspeakably harsh on both sides. Sasha Litvinenko investigated all of it, and he denounced his former employers in no uncertain terms for their dirty deeds. <br> <br> <i>Death of a Dissident</i> opens a window into the dark heart of the Putin Kremlin. With its strong-arm tactics, tight control over the media, and penetration of all levels of government, the old KGB is back with a vengeance. Sasha Litvinenko dedicated his life to exposing this truth. It took his diabolical murder for the world to listen.</p><p><b>Alex Goldfarb, Ph.D.,</b> was a dissident scientist who left Russia in the 1970s, joining the faculty of Columbia University. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, he went to work for George Soros directing charitable initiatives in Russia. He befriended Alexander Litvinenko in the 1990s. Goldfarb later helped Litvinenko work on his memoirs and supported his efforts to expose the abuses of the newly ascendant FSB. Goldfarb is currently the executive director of the International Foundation for Civil Liberties, set up by Boris Berezovsky as an umbrella group for human-rights activists.<br><br><b>Marina Litvinenko</b> first met Alexander at her thirty-first birthday party, in 1993, when he was a young officer in the FSB. They married and she gave birth to a son thereafter. In 2000, the three of them sought asylum in the United Kingdom, and she continues to live in London with her twelve-year-old son.The death of Alexander Sasha Litvinenko in London in November 2006 was a cause clbre, but few people know of the political intrigue that went on behind the scenes. This was no random hit--this was an execution in the style of the Cold War-era KGB. This chronicle by friend Alex Goldfarb and Litvinenkos wife, Marina, reads like the best le Carr or Clancy, and Dennis Boutsikaris is a wise choice for narrator. His portrayal of various East European accents is flawless. Under the spell of Boutsikariss hypnotic voice, we follow the Litvinenkos as they flee Russia for safety (they hoped) in England. Along the way, we learn of Sashas KGB past, his discovery of major crime at the heart of the state, and his poisoning and painful death.

Seeing a way out of his dead-end life and into his dreams, Tom cajoles Caren into entrusting him with the suitcase full of greenbacks the mob has paid her informant husband. When Caren is killed, Tom frames Angland, absconds with the suitcase, runs to the FBI (known to its employees as the Big Law), and wangles himself a berth in the Witness Protection Program.

Caren left him years ago for Keith Angland, his former buddy on the St. Paul police force. Now, apparently, Angland's turned into a cowboy cop, maybe even a Mob-controlled rogue; at the very least, he's assaulted Caren and threatened her life. Broker has been out of uniform for a couple of years, busy caring for his 1-year-old daughter in a rural upstate backwater while his new wife is away on peace-keeping duty in the Balkans. He's heard rumors that Angland is being watched by the Feds, suspected of fingering an informant, but it doesn't touch him personally until Caren turns to him for help. She flees St. Paul and heads for Broker's hideaway with a suitcase full of money, an incriminating tape, and Tom James, a reporter with a gambling jones and a career that's on the skids. James hopes that latching onto Caren---not to mention the $2 million she's absconded with--will turn his luck around. When Caren is killed, the reporter frames Angland, steals the money, and talks his way into the Witness Protection Program, which looks like the perfect ticket out of his dead-end life, especially with Caren's tape as a bargaining chip. The Feds think James walks on water, but Broker isn't convinced. Setting out to find James where the "Big Law" has hidden him, he discovers just how far over the edge both James and Angland have fallen, and who pushed them. An explosive thriller with plenty of action, edge-of-your-seat pacing, and an appealing hero who readers will look forward to encountering again. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Chuck Logan is the author of eight novels, including <em>After the Rain</em>, <em>Vapor Trail</em>, <em>Absolute Zero</em>, and <em>The Big Law</em>.

Outside, a long line snaked by the poolside entrance to the Mutiny Club. If everyone in Miami claimed to know Willy&#x2014;his gig won him side jobs from VIPs and action from a smorgasbord of chicks&#x2014;it was because they wanted inside, where the action was.</p><p>Gomez, you could say, was living the dream.</p><p>Save for tonight.</p><p>As he came down the stairs from the club to the hotel&#x2019;s lobby, he heard a commotion.</p><p>Co�o tu madre! [Fuck your mother!]</p><p>Come mierda! [Eat shit!]</p><p>Hijo de puta! [Son of a whore!]</p><p>Come plomo, maric�n! [Eat lead, faggot!]</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck me,&#x201d; thought Gomez, stifling the urge to piss himself. Ricardo &#x201c;Monkey&#x201d; Morales, a Mutiny regular, was pointing his gun at some other thug. So intense was the vitriol that spit was flying in the air.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew Ricky was a CIA guy&#x2014;an informant,&#x201d; Gomez said of Morales. &#x201c;I knew he was a problem. I knew he was a rat.&#x201d;</p><p>He also knew his&nbsp;.38 Colt revolver was downright Gunsmoke compared with the Monkey&#x2019;s semiautomatic: &#x201c;No way I could let him turn on me with that.&#x201d;</p><p>The domino tables of Little Havana echoed with cigar-smoked tales of el Mono (the Monkey) meting out and cheating death: about how once, in broad daylight, he emptied seventeen rounds from a machine gun into another exile; how there was still shrapnel embedded in the busy Miami street where nine years earlier he had walked away from a car bombing that should have at least severed his legs; how Morales, the lucky bastard, later survived a drive-by shooting that nearly blew out his brains by rolling out of his car and regrouping until he could kill his would-be assassin with gunshots to the face.</p><p>Morales&#x2019;s menacing appearance&#x2014;dead gaze, gorilla-sloped back, huge ears and hands&#x2014;resembled that of some early hominid you might see re-created in the pages of National Geographic.</p><p>Which was seemingly the only publication that hadn&#x2019;t profiled him. Morales had been featured in Esquire, and cover treatments by both Newsday&#x2019;s magazine and Harper&#x2019;s were in the pipeline. The Miami Herald and the Miami News had filing cabinets dedicated to this mythical exile: informant, bomber, drug dealer, assassin, quoter of military histories. Literary agents were calling.</p><p>The Mutiny was where Monkey Morales held court, his bloodstream coursing with cocaine, THC, Quaaludes, Valium, alcohol and caffeine.</p><p>And two decades of Cuban-American rage.</p><p>He always snuck in the back of the hotel and in through the kitchen, where he&#x2019;d hand Chef Manny&#x2014;&#x201c;Manolito!&#x201d;&#x2014;choice little briquettes of cocaine. And maybe a lobster or hog snapper that he had personally speared.</p><p>So, Willy Gomez, security conquistador, hardly ever crossed paths with this guy&#x2014;and he was fine with that. But tonight, for whatever reason, Monkey Morales felt the need to go apeshit a couple of yards from the hotel&#x2019;s front desk.</p><p>&#x201c;Police!&#x201d; yelled Gomez, hand on his gun. &#x201c;Call the police.&#x201d;</p><p>But the lobby had completely emptied out, save for the three of them. Music from the club wafted downstairs:</p><p>I got to ride, ride like the wind</p><p>To be free again</p><p>&#x201c;If I blink,&#x201d; Gomez thought to himself, &#x201c;this psychopath will kill me.&#x201d;</p><p>He resolved to squeeze the trigger. &#x201c;Monkey was already dead, as far as I was concerned. I was worried his brains would splatter on the artwork.&#x201d;</p><p>The future flashed before Gomez. Burton Goldberg, the Mutiny&#x2019;s hard-assed owner, would throw the mother of all shit fits when crime-scene photographers captured the mess in his lobby. He had paid tens of thousands of dollars for Hollywood-caliber set lighting to showcase his art and orchids, micromanaging the scene down to the last lumen. &#x201c;I hired the guy that lit up the Statue of Liberty in &#x2019;seventy-six,&#x201d; Goldberg would always boast to guests.</p><p>Gomez would then have to quit his job, assuming the Mutiny survived the shooting. You didn&#x2019;t just plug Monkey Morales and go on with your life like nothing happened. Yes, many in Miami who hated Morales would send Gomez drinks and introduce the dapper caballero to their daughters and sisters.</p><p>But the Monkey had too many friends in dangerous places&#x2014;spooks, arms dealers, mercenaries, soldiers of fortune&#x2014;who would put a retaliatory hit out on his killer, justified circumstances or not.</p><p>(&#x201c;Or,&#x201d; Willy Gomez thought, &#x201c;if you keep thinking about all this, the Monkey will fucking turn around and kill you himself. Focus!&#x201d;)</p><p>Then the elevator door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Police!&#x201d; yelled Gomez, with renewed desperation.</p><p>Out walked Rafael Villaverde, Morales&#x2019;s tablemate. As the scene came into focus through his tinted glasses, the paunchy exile grimaced, bit a knuckle and took a hesitating step forward. Willy Gomez now had his gun at Morales&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Villaverde held out his hand. &#x201c;No police!&#x201d; he pleaded, looking at Gomez. &#x201c;Ricky. Ricky. Hey. Look. Mira.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Villaverde then carefully walked up to Morales and whispered something.</p><p>Gomez was still convinced the Monkey would blow him away with a flick of his wrist. He imagined his head in a puddle of blood.</p><p>But Morales rapidly tucked his semiautomatic back into his pants. His rival bolted, but Gomez didn&#x2019;t put away his revolver.</p><p>&#x201c;Get the fuck out of here, Ricky!&#x201d; he yelled to Morales, panting, almost hyperventilating. &#x201c;Try! If you even try to fucking come back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know who you talking to?&#x201d; shot back Morales, snarling. &#x201c;Do. You. Know?&#x201d;</p><p>He pulled back his coat to reveal a giant grenade on his belt. It was practically the size of a Florida avocado.</p><p>The Monkey flashed a deranged grin and took his time walking out the front of the Mutiny.</p><p>Outside, an oblivious and unruly crowd would likely have formed. Giggling groupies checking the shrubs and walkways for the club&#x2019;s gilded matchboxes, looking inside for Quaaludes and nose candy.</p><p>The air would have been pungent with cigarette smoke, preparty rum, various overpowering perfumes, colognes and hairsprays, high-tide salt water, sweaty rayon, joints.</p><p>Desperation.</p><p>Aspiration.</p><p>Ferraris, Porsches, Rollses, Benzes, Maseratis and Lambos pulled up, windows wide-open, blasting Blondie, Donna Summer and &#x201c;Funkytown.&#x201d; The Mutiny&#x2019;s valets were tipped to the cuffs to take their time, hog the curb along South Bayshore Drive and keep the beats pumping.</p><p>Opposite the hotel, a marina led out to a bay containing more than one hundred boats, sails flapping, the occasional manatee scraping up against the bows. Giant yachts ferried area regulars&#x2014;who at times could include names like the Bee Gees and Richard Nixon&#x2014;to land.</p><p>In the shallows, you were bound to find a recently arrived Cuban refugee swatting away mosquitoes with a cigarette, desperate to snag a small shark or ray on a handline. Anything bigger he&#x2019;d hawk a mile north at the big intersection on US-1, where others from the Mariel boatlift emigration of Cubans that spring and summer were selling fruit and hog trotters.</p><p>Abutting this vista were Miami City Hall and the police station.</p><p>Back across South Bayshore Drive&#x2014;&#x201c;Rubberneck Avenue,&#x201d; wags were now calling it&#x2014;a scene of intense star watching was taking place outside the Mutiny. Recently spotted:</p><p>Mr. Universe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, his head appearing freakishly small atop the boulder that was his midsection. The tiny waitress from Michigan he&#x2019;d hit on wondered to a girlfriend how she could possibly mount this beast.</p><p>Paul Newman, small as a jockey, and Sally Field were in town with star director Sydney Pollack to shoot the film Absence of Malice. Newman drank so much of the Mutiny&#x2019;s Ch�teau Lafite that he passed out and literally had to be carried up to his suite by a hostess. A brooding Burt Reynolds kept a watchful eye on Sally.</p><p>Playboy hopefuls visited for casting calls in one of the hotel&#x2019;s 130 fantasy-themed rooms and its Playboy Video set. Penthouse used the joint, too.</p><p>The Eagles had just recorded an album in the studio next door. Waitresses gossiped about which member tipped&#x2014;and bedded&#x2014;the best.</p><p>You&#x2019;d see Frankie Valli, in boosting disco heels&#x2014;not to be confused with Dance Fever host Deney Terrio, who reminded everyone at the Mutiny that, hey, you know, he coached Travolta for Saturday Night Fever.</p><p>And &#x201c;Super Freak&#x201d;&#x2013;destined Rick James, traveling with a delegation of coke whores and a croc-skin man purse full of dainty gold utensils for cutting and sniffing lines. It&#x2019;s true: every other word out of his mouth was &#x201c;bitch.&#x201d; &#x201c;Slick Rick&#x201d; laid into a waitress who accidentally called him &#x201c;miss.&#x201d;</p><p>Ted Kennedy, fresh off conceding the Democratic presidential nomination, had often been deep in his cups at the Mutiny, where he hated bumping into Jimmy Carter wingman Hamilton Jordan, who was constantly in Miami to negotiate asylum in Panama for the deposed shah of Iran. Kennedy picked a fight with the club&#x2019;s DJ, who was helping Julio Iglesias, a Mutiny resident, hype his latest record. You catch all that?</p><p>The Doobie Brothers partied hard at the Mutiny, where the joke was they were into way more than just doobies&#x2014;no: the powdery stuff was what inspired band members and their roadies to mindlessly throw cash down from their windows.</p><p>And always wandering the grounds like a lost dog was David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x2014;his mustache and teeth nasty from constantly smoking freebase cocaine with a small blowtorch.</p><p>For all the intense people watching at 2951 South Bayshore Drive, however, the true players at the Mutiny had nothing to do with Hollywood or Motown or the Beltway.</p><p>They were Miami&#x2019;s ruling drug lords. With bullets flying everywhere there at all hours of the day, the town was increasingly being called Dodge City. And so these guys were its &#x201c;cocaine cowboys,&#x201d; the Latin masterminds of the era&#x2019;s go-go wonder drug: yeyo, perico, toot, snow, white pony. Cocaine. And the Mutiny was their favorite saloon.</p><p>It was in this parallel universe that the Mutiny&#x2019;s free-spending cocaine lords swapped their old-world names (say, Wilfredo Perez del Cayo) for Cubano goodfella handles like Carlene, Redbeard, Coca-Cola, el Loco, the Boys, Recotado (&#x201c;Stocky&#x201d;), Veneno (&#x201c;Venom&#x201d;). Weetchie, Chunky, Peloo, Perro (&#x201c;Dog&#x201d;), Mungy. Venao (&#x201c;Deer&#x201d;), Raspao (&#x201c;Snow Cone&#x201d;), the Big Blonde, Super Papi. Chino, Albertico, Kiki.</p><p>Even their pets lived extra large.</p><p>Kingpin Mario Tabraue had a chimp named Caesar, whom he adorned with a gold-rope necklace holding a fifty-peso gold coin, an eighteen-karat ID bracelet with his name in diamonds and a ladies&#x2019; Rolex Presidential. The primate was partial to turtlenecks and a New York baseball cap, and proudly rode shotgun in his owner&#x2019;s Benz while waving a Cuban cigar.</p><p>They&#x2019;d shuttle to and from Tabraue&#x2019;s mansion around the corner, where panthers, pythons, raptors and even a toucan roamed the grounds. Tabraue fed live rats to a two-headed snake and an owl he kept in a Plexiglas cage. He would sometimes answer the door with a tarantula peeking out from under his cap.</p><p>&#x201c;Every known narcotic trafficker in Miami would be at the Mutiny,&#x201d; recalled Diosdado &#x201c;D. C.&#x201d; Diaz, a Miami police detective. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d see their wives and mistresses there. Their hit men. They&#x2019;d throw a big celebration every time they brought in a load; they&#x2019;d send Cristal and Dom to dealers at other tables. I&#x2019;d follow the bottles and jot down their license plate numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>So vital was the Mutiny for watching the interplay of dealers, informants, celebs and public figures, he says, that authorities were understandably loath to disturb the ecosystem. &#x201c;Why stir up the pot and scare them all away?&#x201d; Diaz said.</p><p>Indeed, just as Monkey Morales was about to get his brains blown out by the bouncer in the lobby, his tablemate, one of Miami&#x2019;s biggest cocaine dealers, attempted to bribe D. C. Diaz with a Rolex and an antique, World War II&#x2013;issue gun. However, the kingpin refused to part ways with a silencer-equipped MAC-10 submachine gun that Monkey had lent him and wanted back.</p><p>On the very week Morales stared down Gomez, owner Burton Goldberg threw a raucous Halloween bash at the club.</p><p>Yes, you could argue Miami was now devolving into a third-world republic that was bound to break off and sink into the Atlantic. But the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, adorned with lush, carefully lit foliage and stunning women, was raking it in.</p><p>And so the woolly-chested Goldberg donned two-inch eyelashes, a flowing blond wig and a long white gown, and skipped around tapping guests with his wand&#x2014;a fairy godmother pretending to sprinkle magic pixie dust.</p><p>Subtle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>Heaven in Hell</p><p>Burton Goldberg&#x2019;s Mutiny at Sailboat Bay was one of the country&#x2019;s most lucrative hotels, perennially overbooked and sending off armored trucks with sacks of its cash profits, albeit in the new murder and drug capital of America, a city that had been ravaged by race riots, gun killings and the sudden arrival of 125 thousand Cuban refugees, many of them sprung right from Fidel Castro&#x2019;s jails.</p><p>By the turn of the decade, the 130-room hotel and club was a criminal free-trade zone of sorts where gangsters could both revel in Miami&#x2019;s danger and escape from it.</p><p>&#x201c;All roads led back to the Mutiny,&#x201d; said Wayne Black, an undercover cop who listened in to dope deals from a tinted van across the street, often wearing nothing but BVDs to cope with the stifling heat and humidity. &#x201c;The druggies,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informants, cops&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;were all there.&#x201d;</p><p>America in the late 1970s and early &#x2019;eighties was in a pronounced funk: inflation and unemployment were high; consumer sentiment was in the dumps. But so exceptional was Miami&#x2019;s cocaine economy that dopers were paying banks to accept suitcases full of cash (while certificates of deposit were yielding 20 percent, on top of your choice of toaster or alarm clock). According to one study from Florida International University in Miami, at least one-third of the city&#x2019;s economic output was derived from narcotics at the time.</p><p>So much hot money was sloshing around Miami that the Mutiny was selling more bottles of Dom Perignon than any other establishment on the planet, according to the bubbly&#x2019;s distributor, whose executives visited in disbelief at the turn of the decade. They heard right: a suite at the hotel was converted into a giant walk-in cooler; beautiful women would ooh and ahh at tabletop cascades of bubbly in stacks of flutes; dopers bought bottles for the house when their loads came in and management often flew out the Mutiny&#x2019;s private plane at the last minute to procure even more from other cities.</p><p>Internationally wanted hit men and mercenaries chilled at the Mutiny.

Delany&#39;s The Jewel-Hinged Jaw, from 1978. The impact of its demonstration that science fiction was a special language, rather than just gadgets and green-skinned aliens, began reverberations still felt in science fiction criticism. This edition includes two new essays, one written at the time and one written about those times, as well as an introduction by writer and teacher Matthew Cheney, placing Delany&#39;s work in historical context. Close textual analyses of Thomas M. Disch, Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, and Joanna Russ read as brilliantly today as when they first appeared.

The daylight air struggles over Germany during World War II involved thousands of aircraft, dozens of units, and hundreds of aerial engagements. Until now, there has been no single book that covers the complete story, from the highest levels of air strategy to the individual tales of Fw 190s, Bf 109s and Me 262s in air combat against the American bomber streams.<br><br> This work explores the German air defense system until its collapse in 1945. It examines the detrimental effect of Luftwaffe theory and doctrine on the German air arms ability to defend the homeland once the Allied Combined Bomber Offensive began in earnest. The hard-pressed Luftwaffe leadership attempted to cobble together an air-defense network while at the same time tending to the combat fronts in Russia and the Mediterranean. Units developed specialized tactics and weapons for dealing with heavily defended bomber formations, while senior commanders sought to construct an elaborate command and control system integrating radar, observers, anti-aircraft guns, and fighters. By mid-1944, they had lost the battle - but had exacted a terrible price from the Americans in the process.<br><br> The product of a ten-year collaboration between two noted Luftwaffe historians, this work fills a major gap in the literature of World War II. The authors have examined original war diaries, logbooks, doctrine manuals, after-action reports, and interviews with many combat veterans to produce a richly detailed account.<br><br> Illustrated with nearly two hundred photographs, as well as new maps and diagrams, Luftwaffe Over Germany is certain to become the standard work on the subject.</p><p>Donald L.

But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling, Eragon soon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself. Overnight his simple life is shattered and he is thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic and power. With only an ancient sword and the advice of an old storyteller for guidance, Eragon and the fledgling dragon must navigate the dangerous terrain and dark enemies of an Empire ruled by a king whose evil knows no bounds. Can Eragon take up the ,antle of the legendary Dragon Riders? The fate of the Empire may rest in his hands -</p><p>Here's a great big fantasy that you can pull over your head like a comfy old sweater and disappear into for a whole weekend. Christopher Paolini began <i>Eragon</i> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p> Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. </p><p> In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <i>Eldest</i>. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Eragon is a very special book. It is a great story, one that will you'll remember long after you finish it. Eragon inspires passion in fans.

As the organization continues to grow and expand its range of targets, ELF has taken an extreme position against individuals, corporations, and governments that, in the organization's view, places monetary gain ahead of the natural environment. Rejecting state sanctioned means of legal protest, ELF uses economic sabotage to inflict financial suffering on those deemed objectionable.<br><br> In February 2002, the FBI listed the ELF as the largest and most active US-based terrorist group. Although no one has died in any of these operations, ELF's campaign against loggers, SUV dealerships, and others it considers threats to the planet have galvanized and polarized the environmental movement.<br><br> Former ELF spokesperson Rosebraugh charts the history and ideology of ELF and explores their tactics, successes, and limitations. He shows how ELFers offer an uncompromising vision of an earth under assault from the forces of greed and corporate violence, and how they employ direct action against those they deem a threat to the planet. <br><br> Rosebraugh also examines the issues of whether violence is or is not justifiable, and the short- and long-term political benefits and drawbacks of using violence. Finally, he offers a trenchant vision of the future of the environmental movement, radical politics, and US democracy under the so-called Patriot Act.<br><br> Whatever your view of direct action or violence, <strong>Burning Rage of a Dying Planet</strong> is essential reading for those trying to understand the mindset and motivations of contemporary radical environmentalists.</p><p><b>Craig Rosebraugh</b> was a spokesman for the Earth Liberation Front from its inception in 1997 to September 2001. In February 2002, he was called to testify before Congress, where he invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 50 times. Rosebaugh has appeared in numerous publications, such as the <i>New York Times, Newsweek, Time, National Geographic,</i> and others, and has written for <i>Earth First!, No Compromise,</i> and other radical journals. He lives in Portland, Oregon.For five years the aboveground face of the underground environmental group Earth Liberation Front (ELF), Rosebraugh is a man of unrepentant revolutionary convictions. From 1997 until 2001, the Portland, Ore., activist funneled "communiques" from the anonymous and loosely organized "elves" of ELF to local and national media. This role as spokesperson&#x2014;publicizing ELF&#x2019;s acts of vandalism, arson and bombing directed against logging companies, "fur farms," businesses that develop suburban housing, a Vail ski resort and even SUV dealerships&#x2014;quickly brought him to the attention of the FBI. Over the years, his several offices and homes were repeatedly raided, he was subpoenaed seven times to appear before Portland grand juries investigating ELF actions, and in 2002&#x2014;by which time the FBI had dubbed the shadowy Earth Liberation Front America&#x2019;s largest and most active terrorist organization&#x2014;he was called before a congressional committee investigating ecoterrorism. This candid memoir of a young revolutionary (he was 30 when he wrote the book) is often good-natured and even genial, particularly in its account of those police raids and grand jury appearances. But it&#x2019;s also controversial, as Rosebraugh, though thoughtful and articulate, stands firm in his belief that violence is a legitimate tool in the fight for radical change in America.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet he was himself a curious representative of this culture. He was an Eton-educated, former Kings African Rifles officer, the son of a highly successful banker, who bridged two very different worlds. He had, Jagger said, an aura; he was a tastemaker, a hedonist, a lousy businessman whose artists adored him, a promiscuous homosexual who avoided the gay scene. By the time of his death from AIDS in 1986 he had become an almost forgotten figure, his vision no longer in tune with the conservatism of the eighties from which the sixties was a brief departure.</p><p><p><b>"More than any other figure I can think of, Robert Fraser personifies the Sixties as I remember them." --Paul McCartney</b> </p><p>Arrested for possession of drugs with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in the infamous 1967 Redlands bust, Robert Fraser embodied many of the elements that made up Swinging London in the 1960s: pop music, fashion, drugs, art, and cinema.

It includes not only writing that is beautiful, but phrases that are novel and interesting. According to the Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitaro (1870-1945; see figure 1), true creativity is not the product of a conscious effort but rather the "phenomenon of life itself." True creation must arise from mu-shin, or the state of "no-mind," a state beyond thought, emotions, and expectations. Work that is produced through conscious effort is ultimately devoid of life.<br><br>Zen calligraphy in particular must spring from shonen sozoku, a Buddhist term equivalent to "true thought." Shonen is a state of full concentration that is devoid of thoughts and ideas, while sozoku here means "free-flowing continuity." Greatness in brushwork cannot be achieved through conscious effort; it is only achieved through the states of mu-shin and shonen sozuku, or "no-mind" and a continuous state free of the thoughts and ideas that distract the mind.<br><br>Zen calligraphy differs from other calligraphic disciplines as it is focused on the realization of "no-mind." Furthermore, in contrast tosho, which uses Chinese characters as a basis, it is the expression of Zen through a brush, whether the result is a single stroke, a Zen circle, or an ink painting. While sho is restricted to brushed writing, Zen calligraphy extends to other forms of brushwork.<br><br>Nearly all calligraphy today is born of conscious attention to an aesthetic concept, but we rarely find lines that are truly alive. In contrast, the calligraphy of Zen masters such as Daito Kokushi (1282-1337; founder of Daitokuji temple in Kyoto) or Ikkyu Sojun (1394-1481) resonates with the energy of "no-mind" achieved through complete concentration. In these works, the lines are filled with vitality and the shapes are fresh and original.<br><br>Sen no Rikyu (1522-91), who established many of the basic precepts of the tea ceremony, held that nothing surpassed Zen calligraphy as a subject for display in the alcove of the tea room. He undoubtedly felt that only art works that reflect the eternal vitality of Zen writings could encourage the mind toward enlightenment.<br><br>Rikyu recognized that calligraphy necessarily demands the highest level of spirituality. A line that manifests clarity cannot be drawn if the heart is clouded by worldly concerns; a stroke cannot be brushed with resolution if the heart is agitated; and calligraphy that reveals depth cannot be produced if cultivation and experience are shallow.<br><br>To write kanji characters that resonate and demonstrate their deeper meaning, one's own mind must achieve unity with the meaning of the words-a requirement that calls for a higher level of spirituality. The calligrapher, therefore, must strive for the state of "no-mind" through meditation and contemplation.</p><p><br>TANCHU TERAYAMA is a professor at Nishogakusha University and the co-author of <em>Zen and the Art of Calligraphy</em>. His collection of historic calligraphy was the subject of an exhibition at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.<br><br>THOMAS F. JUDGE is a Japanese-English translator now based in the San Francisco area. He has lived in Kanazawa, Osaka, and Tokyo, where he pursued his interest in Japanese crafts. He is the author of <em>Edo Craftsmen: Master Artisans of Old Tokyo</em>, a look at living craftspeople working in traditional crafts.<br><br>JOHN STEVENS is Professor of Buddhist Studies, as well as Aikido Instructor, at Tohoku Fukushi University in Sendai, Japan. He has been associated with Tanchu Terayama for nearly thirty years and has written a biography of Yamaoka Tesshu, The Sword of No-Sword, as well as many other books on various aspects of Asian culture.<br>[Introduction] <p>Sho, the art of brush calligraphy, has always been highly regarded as an art form in the Far East. Although the hand of the artist can be seen in any work of art, it has long been said that sho is the artist. The pliant hairs of the brush, the life force of the carbon that constitutes the ink, and the spontaneity of the brushed letters all work together to express the spirit of the calligrapher. </p><p>The calligrapher must become one with the brush if the brush is to come to life. The ink can be thought of as a subtle substance that expresses life and death, and the brushstroke as an opportunity for expression that embodies the whole of the artist. </p><p>To become one with the brush means eliminating the self and infusing the ink with the spirit to make each brushstroke resonate with vital energy. The ability to manifest one's strength comes only through dedicated practice. </p><p>As a basic exercise, drawing a single straight line is ideal. This line is called the mujibo, the "Zen line," or the "line of nothingness." This single stroke can be taken as the basis of sho. To draw a single stroke does not call for any special technique; all that is required is simply to grasp the brush firmly between the thumb and fingers, keep the brush shaft vertical, and then, while slowly exhaling, pull the brush with all your strength, as if dragging a heavy stone. As with many art forms, sho can be very revealing. A person whose heart is clouded will not be able to draw a line that shines with purity. A person shallow in experience or cultivation cannot draw a line that reveals depth. A person lacking vitality will not draw a line that resonates with energy. Even a single straight line can be a mirror of the spirit. </p><p>In Chinese art, sho and painting are thought of as one. All paintings begin from sho: the brushstrokes that make up the characters in calligraphy are the same strokes that form the elements of an ink painting. Anyone who can brush a single vibrant stroke can apply this ability to brush an enso (Zen circle), or to paint an orchid, bamboo, or landscape. </p><p>Writing words and phrases in kanji (Chinese characters), which themselves hold a certain mystique, raises calligraphy to a higher, spiritual level. This spirituality is expressed in sho through creative brushwork that plays on the shape and nuanced meanings of the kanji. </p><p>Over the centuries, Zen monks and nuns have brushed many classic works of calligraphy and painting. Calligraphy has long been appreciated as an art form in the Western world as well. Some Western artists, such as the French fauvist expressionist Georges Rouault (1871-1958) and Spanish surrealist Joan Miro (1893-1983), were drawn toward calligraphy in their later years. For those who are fascinated with art, sho can be seen as a form of true artistic expression. </p><p>Hitsuzendo, the Way of the Zen Brush, is a form of calligraphy based on the principles of Zen.

I could usually kill them better, but her TV was way littler than ours and I was sick. That's why I was in Miss Sara's trailer. Only I wasn't supposed to call it a trailer. "It's a mobile home," Mom reminded me when she brought me here this morning. Even though she sometimes called it a trailer, too.<br><br>Things were different since the fire. Mom said I should call Sara "Miss Sara" like I did when I was little. It's politer. Miss Sara used to hug me and be real nice and Mom's best friend. Since the fire, Mom and her hardly even talk. The only reason I was in the mobile home was because Mom was desperate. That's what she said to Uncle Marcus this morning.<br><br>I was still in bed, tired from getting sick from both ends all night long. Uncle Marcus slept over, like he does a lot. I heard Mom say, "I've tried everybody. I'm desperate. I'll have to ask Sara." Uncle Marcus said he could stay home with me and Mom said, "No! Please, Marcus. I need you with me."<br><br>"I can stay alone," I called, but it came out quiet on account of being sick. I was sixteen; I didn't need a babysitter. I was sure I was done barfing, too. I couldn't be sick anymore because Maggie was coming home today. I wanted to jump up and down and yell "Maggie's coming home!" but I was too tired. I could only jump up and down in my imagination.<br><br>I heard Mom on the phone with Miss Sara. "Please, Sara. I'm sure it's just a twenty-four-hour bug. I know it's a huge favor to ask, but I can't leave him alone. It'll only be for a few hours." In the before-the-fire days, Mom would say, "Can you watch Andy today?" and Miss Sara would say, "Sure! No problem!" But this wasn't those days anymore.<br><br>After a minute, Mom said, "Thank you! Oh, thank you so much! We'll drop him at your house about ten-thirty."<br><br>I pulled the blanket over my head. I didn't want to get up and get dressed and go to Miss Sara's trailer. I just wanted to go back to sleep till Maggie got home.<br><br>I brought my own pillow with me to the trailer. In the car, I leaned against the window with my head on it. Mom kept turning around from her seat. "Are you okay, Andy?"<br><br>"Mmm," I said. That meant yes, but I was too tired to open my mouth. I knew she wanted to reach back and touch my forehead. She was a nurse and she could tell if you had a fever by touching your forehead. Nurses are very smart like that.<br><br>"Just think, Andy," Uncle Marcus said. "When we pick you up at Sara... Miss Sara's this afternoon, Maggie will be with us."<br><br><em>Free, </em>I thought. Maggie would finally be free. I hated visiting her at that stupid prison.<br><br>At the trailer, I laid down on Miss Sara's couch with my pillow. Miss Sara got a blanket and Mom covered me over. She got to put her hand on my forehead then. She gave Miss Sara ginger ale and crackers for me. I started falling asleep as Mom said, "I can't thank you enough, Sara," and things like that.<br><br>Then she left and I fell asleep for a long time. I woke up and Miss Sara was walking across the living room. She looked right at me. She was carrying a big box with a picture of a pot on it. She stopped walking and put it on the floor.<br><br>"How are you feeling?" she asked. She had some lines on her forehead and by her eyes. So did Mom, but not as many.<br><br>"'Kay," I said. My mouth tasted icky.<br><br>"You ready for some ginger ale and crackers? Think you can keep them down?"<br><br>I nodded. Except for feeling tired and kind of shaky, I was fine. I could've stayed home alone, no problem.<br><br>I sat up and Miss Sara brought me ginger ale in a glass with ice and crackers on a plate. Her eyes looked like she'd been crying. They were red how your eyes got. She smiled a funny smile at me. I smiled one back at her. People sometimes cried when they were happy and I knew that's what was going on. Mom had red eyes all week. Miss Sara was probably as happy about Maggie coming home as we all were.<br><br>I drank some ginger ale, which tasted good. Miss Sara carried the box outside. When she came back in, she said, "Do you want to play some of Keith's video games?" Which is how I started playing Mega Warrior.<br><br>Now I shot another Mega Warrior and then a Super Mega Warrior, which are the ones with the arrow things on their heads. At least it was a school day and Keith wasn't home. Keith was one of the people I couldn't save at the fire. Mom said he could actually die at first, but he didn't. He got scars, though. His hands and his arms look like they have maps on them, only without the country names. One of his hands is scrunched up, kind of. Part of his face has that map look on it, too. He got held back and now we're both juniors. He hated me even before I couldn't save him. I felt sorry for him, though, because of his scars.<br><br>The phone rang in the kitchen. I could see Miss Sara pick it up. She made a face.<br><br>"You said no later than one-thirty, Laurel!" she said. Laurel was my mom.<br><br>One of the regular warriors killed my littlest man. That happened when you forgot to concentrate, like I was doing because I wanted to know what Mom was saying.<br><br>"All right," Miss Sara said. She hung up the phone without saying goodbye, which was rude.<br><br>I wasn't doing so good at Mega Warriors now, but I had good determination and kept trying.<br><br>Miss Sara came in the room again. "Your mom said she won't be back till around four-thirty," she said.<br><br>"Okay." I killed two Super Mega Warriors in a row. Bang! Bang! Then one killed me.<br><br>"Andy? Look at me."<br><br>I looked at her face even though I didn't stop pushing the controller buttons.<br><br>"I need to run to the store," she said. "Keith'll be home soon. When he arrives, I need you to give him this envelope, all right?"<br><br>She put one of those long white envelopes on the coffee table. It said <em>Keith </em>on it.<p></p> <p>"Okay."<br><br>She was in my way. I had to move my head to see the TV.<br><br>"Andy!" Miss Sara said. "Look at me!"<br><br>I stopped pushing the buttons. She was using an I-mean-business voice.<br><br>"Did you hear me?" she asked. "What did I just say?"<br><br>"Mom won't be here until... later." I couldn't remember the time she said.<br><br>"And what else?" Miss Sara used to be so nice. She'd turned into another lady this year.<br><br>"You're going to the store."<br><br>"And <em>this, </em>Andy." She picked up the envelope and kind of shook it in front of my face. "What did I say about this?"<br><br>"Give the mail to Keith," I said.<br><br>"It's very important."<br><br>"I'll give it to him."<br><br>She looked at her watch. "Oh, never mind. I'll put it where he'll see it."<br><br>"Okay," I said.<br><br>She walked in the kitchen, then came back again. "All right," she said. "I'm going now."<br><br>"Goodbye." I wished she would just <em>go.</em><br><br>I started playing again when she left. Then I got thirsty and my glass was empty. I walked into the kitchen to get more ginger ale. I saw the mail that said <em>Keith </em>on it on the table. She said it was important. What if Keith didn't see it there?<br><br>I took the envelope back in the living room and stuck it in my book bag so I couldn't forget to give it to him. Then I sat down again to kill some more warriors.<br><br><em>Maggie</em><br><br>They moved me from my cell hours later than I'd expected because of some paperwork issue Mom had to straighten out. I was afraid they weren't going to let me go. There'd been some mistake, I thought. A prison official would show up at my cell door and say, <em>Oh, we thought you were in prison for twelve months, but we read the order wrong. It's really twelve years. </em>It's amazing the things you can imagine when you're alone in a cell.<br><br>I sat on my skinny bed with my hands folded in my lap and my heart pounding, waiting. An hour. Two hours. I couldn't budge. Couldn't open the book I was reading. Just sat there waiting for them to come tell me how twelve months was a mistake and I couldn't get out today. I deserved the twelve years. Everyone knew that, including me.<br><br>But finally, Letitia, my favorite guard, came to get me. I let out my breath like I'd been holding it in for those two hours and started to cry. Outside the bars of my cell, Letitia's face was nothing more than a dark, wavy blur.<br><br>She shook her head at me, and I knew she was wearing that half sneer it took me a few months to recognize as a kind of affection.<br><br>"You crying?" she asked. "Girl, you cried the day you come in here and now you crying the day you leave. Make up your mind."<br><br>I tried laughing but it came out more like a whimper.<br><br>"Let's go," she said, unlocking the door, sliding the bars to the left, and I thought, <em>that's the last time I'll ever have to hear that door scrape open. </em>I walked next to Letitia as we started down the broad central hall between the rows of cells, side by side like equals. Two free women. <em>Free. </em>I needed a tissue, but didn't have one. I wiped my nose with the back of my hand.<br><br>"You'll be back!" one of the women called to me from her cell. Others hooted and hollered. Cussed and shouted. "Yo, bitch! Gonna burn some more kiddies, huh?" <em>BB </em>they called me. Baby Burner, even though the people who died in the fire were two teenagers and an adult. I didn't fit in. It wasn't just that I was white. There were plenty of white women in the prison. It wasn't that I was young. Sixteen was the age at which you were tried as an adult in North Carolina, so there were plenty younger than me. It was, as Letitia told me the first week I got there, that "they can smell the money on you, girl."I didn't see how. I didn't look any different from them, but I guessed everybody knew my story. How I'd laid a fire around a church to let my firefighter boyfriend shine in the department. How I didn't set the fire when I realized kids would be in the church, but how Keith Weston lit a cigarette, tossing the match on the fuel I'd poured without realizing it was there. How people died and burned and had their lives totally screwed up. They all knew the details, and even though some of them had murdered people, maybe sticking a knife in their best friend's heart, or they sold drugs to junior-high kids or robbed a store or whatever, they stuck together and I was the outcast.<br><br>At the beginning of the year I'd thought about Martha Stewart a lot, how even though she was a rich white woman, she made all these friends in prison and they loved her. Adored her, even. How she came out on top. I told myself maybe that's how it could be with me.<br><br>As Letitia and I went down the wide corridor between the cells, I remembered the first time I'd made that long walk. The hooting and name-calling. I didn't think of the women as people then. They seemed like wild dogs and I was afraid one of them would break loose and run after me. Now I knew better. They couldn't get out. I learned it wasn't when they were in their cells that they could hurt me, but out in the yard. I was beaten up twice, and for someone like me who'd never even been hit, it was terrible. Both times, it was a girl named Lizard. She was six feet tall with thin, straggly, almost colorless hair. She was skinny and her body seemed out of proportion to the long arms and legs she could wrap around you like strands of wire. She let me have it, for no reason I could think of except that she hated me, like so many of the others hated me. I wasn't good at getting beaten up. I didn't fight back well. I cowered, covering my face with my hands, while she pounded my ribs and tore handfuls of my dark hair out by the roots. I had one thought running through my mind: <em>I deserve this. </em>You see people getting beaten up in the movies and TV all the time. There'll be cuts and some blood, but you don't get to feel the fear while it's happening. The not-knowing-how-bad-it'll-get kind of fear. Or the pain that goes on for days. Letitia saved me both times. Then I was "Letitia's pretty baby." LPB. They had initials for everything. A lot of the initials I never did figure out because I wasn't part of the in crowd. I wasn't the only outsider, though. Not the only one getting picked on. I wasn't the weakest by far. They'd find the ones who were least able to defend themselves and move in for the kill. All I could think was, thank God Andy wasn't the one to land in prison. He would never have survived.<br><br>I got over the whole Martha Stewart fantasy real fast. After the first couple of days, I didn't even try to make friends. I kept to myself, reading, thinking about how I was supposed to be in college at UNC Wilmington this year. Maybe a business major, which seemed totally ridiculous to me now. Business? What did that matter, really? Who could I help with a degree in business? What good could I do for anybody but myself and maybe some bloodsucking company? I tried to keep a journal, but I threw it away after a couple of months because I couldn't stand rereading what I'd written in the first few days about Ben and how I still loved him even though he betrayed me. How I did something so stupid out of love for him. How I killed people. <em>I took lives. </em>I wrote those words over and over on four or five pages of the journal like some third-grade punishment. I'd touch the latest cut on my lip from Lizard or the bruises that crisscrossed my legs and think <em>these are nothing.</em><br><br></p></p><h2>Kathleen&#39;s Abiding Hope (Life of Faith, A: Kathleen McKenzie Series)</h2><p>Kathleen McKenzie&#39;s displaced life with relatives on a farm in Ohio took a lot of getting used to.

Haute Provence, the hidden heart of the Midi, is the last bastion of the old French way of culinary life. Here Brennan offers a loving homage to this special region, a rich tapestry of personal stories and delicious recipes, including such savory dishes as Leg of Lamb in Crust of Herbes de Provence, Braised Greens and Black Olives, Beef Daube with Dried Cepes, Belgian Endive and Mache Salad, Soupe au Pistou, and tempting desserts such as Tarte Tatin of Brandied Pears. An exquisite cookbook as well as a transporting memoir, <i>The Food and Flavors of Haute Provence</i> is perfect for all who long for the rustic pleasures of the South of France.</p><p>Georgeanne Brennan is a James Beard Award-winning author of numerous cooking and garden books. She lives in Northern California and France.<br><br>Jeffrey Fisher has had his illustrations published in many books and magazines. He lives in France.<br><br>Patricia Wells is the author of Bistro Cooking and Simply French. She divides her time between Paris and Provence.<p>Reviews From:</p><p> New York Newsday<br> <br> </p><p> Publishers Weekly <br> </p><p> <br> </p><p> By Marie Bianco</p><p> THE ADVENTURE began in 1970 when Georgeanne Brennan and her husband left California and bought a house in Haute Provence, a rural and rugged area of France an hour north of the more glamorous Cote d'Azur. In the plain and simple life they chose, Brennan planted a kitchen garden, raised pigs and made goat cheese. But best of all she cooked. </p><p> Her new book, <i>"The Food and Flavors of Haute Provence,"</i> part diary, part cookbook and part armchair travel guide, focuses on one of the largely undiscovered areas of France. Here her neighbors eat what they grow, gather, raise and hunt, and she does the same. Her recipe for <i>boudin noir</i> (black pudding) comes from the butcher, the one for poor man's foie gras from Madame Corbet, a neighbor. </p><p> Each chapter gives instructions on some of the basics of Proven�al cuisine--things I've always wanted to try, such as curing olives, desalting dried cod, seasoning fresh cheese, drying mushrooms, preserving fruit in alcohol. </p><p> In Haute Provence the food is perfumed with olive oil, and its production is a large part of country life. Brennan shares her delight at the first sampling of oil from her own olive trees. She describes the importance of every French farm woman's <i>potager,</i> or kitchen garden, which supplies fresh vegetables from the first fava beans of spring to the last pumpkin of fall. </p><p> Brennan's recipes ring true with the flavors of Haute Provence. They are varied and easy to follow. Although you may not be tempted to try your hand at boudin noir or wild boar casserole, there are plenty of pasta dishes, seasonal vegetable side dishes, chicken and lamb entrees and simple desserts. </p><p> <br> </p><p><br><br> </p><p> From: Publishers Weekly </p><p> Just when it seems that Proven�al cuisine is almost old-fashioned, Brennan makes it new again. She and her husband bought their home in the fuzzily defined region of Haute Provence in 1970. While their children were small, they lived off their farm, keeping goats and pigs and selling goat cheese locally. Their involvement in local agricultrue, described in essays on, for example the making of olive oil, sets this fine book apart from the run-of-the-mill memoirs of expatriate life in Tuscany and Provence. Only an insider is likely to know that "French pharmacists are trained in mycology and enthusiastically identify mushrooms brought to them." The recipes are excellent, offering toothsome and generally simple-to-fix dishes that highlight the flavors of Provence. Chapters are arranged around ingredients such as wild mushrooms and truffles or nuts. Each begins with an essay and a few basic techniques (e.g., the chapter on cheese explains how to make flavored cheese spreads.) Fresh flavors abound in dishes like Galettes of Wild Greens, and Warm Polenta Cr�pes with Peaches and Fresh Goat Cheese. Among the desserts is Green Almond Ice Cream. Heartier foods include Baked Pheasant with Chestnuts, C�pes, and Cabbage; Fried Ravioli with Garlic-Spinach filling; and Baked Pasta with Chanterelles. Brennan's graceful blend of agricultrual knowledge, food combinations, flavor descriptions and clear recipe directions is outstanding. </p><p><br><br></p></p><h2>The Bone Density Program: 6 Weeks to Strong Bones and a Healthy Body</h2><p>It's a fact.

Until recently,<br>she never had to pay attention to her weight, but ever since she passed<br>40, it seems to creep up on her if she's not careful. She's probably out<br>buying organic baby spinach and portobello mushrooms and free-range<br>chicken for dinner tonight--if she's done with her three-mile walk--and<br>picking the right wine to go with it. She took a multivitamin this morning<br>that also contains several trace minerals, and before bed tonight she'll<br>take a calcium and magnesium capsule. Her new doctor helped her cut down<br>on the amount of thyroid hormone she was taking to counteract her<br>underactive gland--and her energy level redoubled. Her colleagues at the<br>university are always saying they would mistake her for a student if they<br>didn't know better, and although she always dismisses that as pure<br>flattery, inside she feels no different from how she did in her younger<br>days.

Once she cut out most of the sugary snacks she used to live on,<br>she no longer felt lethargic after she ate, and she never got the<br>uncomfortable sense of fullness that had taken away some of the pleasure<br>of a nice piece of steak. Petite and "fine boned" (as her mother, who gave<br>her daughter her peaches-and-cream complexion, always said), Sheila<br>certainly stands out among many of the employees (who tend to be male and<br>muscular) at the construction firm she founded. She was a devoted jogger<br>for years when that was all the rage, but these days she prefers her<br>ballet classes or swimming laps, even though some days she just can't get<br>to either. But it's not like her company can run itself!<br><br>Althea, an African-American accountant--and grandmother of three--recently<br>reached a personal best on the chest press machine at the gym, and was<br>delighted to watch the man following her take the weight down a notch. She<br>became a vegetarian many years ago, partly to keep her large frame healthy<br>despite what the actuarial tables say is a few too many pounds for a woman<br>of her height. These days, she is eating more vegan meals, though she does<br>occasionally eat fish. After she switched from dairy milk to soymilk<br>(calcium fortified)--except in her coffee, where nothing but cream will<br>do--she noticed her on-and-off bouts of indigestion were more off than on.<br>Then she read in a magazine about the heart-healthy and estrogenic effects<br>of soy products, and began to think that maybe all those tofu stir-fries<br>had something to do with her low cholesterol levels and why she never had<br>menopausal symptoms. That's when she got some of that soy protein powder<br>from the gourmet/organic food store in her neighborhood. She liked that<br>store, even though the produce can't really compare with what she grows in<br>her own large garden.<br>WHAT DOES A HEALTHY WOMAN LOOK LIKE?<br>Just like you. We are told so often and so much about "female problems"<br>and the many ways women's bodies break down, especially as they age, that<br>sometimes we lose sight of the fact that being healthy should be the<br>norm--in fact, is the norm. The vibrant, dynamic women described above are<br>all at different stages of their lives--early 40s, perimenopausal with no<br>symptoms; early 50s, experiencing menopause with no symptoms; and mid-60s,<br>finished with menopause and none the worse for wear.<br><br>Each has strong, healthy bones providing the foundation<br>for strong, healthy lives and can expect to keep them. As health-conscious<br>women and intelligent consumers, they are aware of the dangers of<br>osteoporosis--literally "porous bones" (bones with holes) so brittle they<br>can fracture from the force of nothing more than a sneeze--and the<br>associated conditions of osteomalacia (soft bones) and osteopenia (low<br>bone mass). But they haven't surrendered to the hype that makes it seem<br>like a coming plague from which there is no escape (except for the<br>salvation of harsh chemicals), nor the complacency that this simply,<br>inevitably, is a part of growing older. Rather, they've put their energy<br>into strategies much like the ones recommended in this book and have<br>radiant health to show for it.<br><br>None of it is an accident. There may be some benefit from "good genes,"<br>but each of these women is health conscious and aware of her body and its<br>needs, and takes care to do what is good for it and what feels good. But<br>none has taken quite the same approach to wellness, and not all of them<br>follow a specific plan. They've each made changes and adjustments,<br>particularly at times of shifting hormones, but mostly they are busy<br>living their lives, enjoying their work and their families, their homes<br>and their friends, playing and resting and juggling many demands.<br><br>Just like you. Whatever your current situation, whatever your age,<br>whatever your bones look like right now, if you know the right things to<br>do for your body, you too can have the same healthy, active lifestyle as<br>any of these women--and keep it for the rest of your life. You may need to<br>do something differently from what they have, and you may want to try<br>things they haven't. Your body may react differently to whatever tack you<br>do take. But you can learn from them, and the people whose stories are<br>told throughout this book, as well as from the facts and figures laid out<br>here, and work out strategies for yourself to get and keep your bones<br>strong for a lifetime.<br>USE WHAT WORKS<br>To do that, you'll want to access every variety of medicine, traditional<br>and "alternative," preventive and therapeutic, pharmacologic and<br>physiologic, cutting-edge and tried-and-true. That's just the wide<br>spectrum I've brought to this book, and the six-week program walks you<br>through all of them so you won't get lost in a tangle of conflicting<br>information, but rather will leave with the best each has to offer.<br><br>As an osteopathic physician (more on just what that means in a minute),<br>it's my life's work to integrate all these areas into one system of total<br>wellness, uprooting any problems at their source, rather than focusing on<br>fighting disease or reducing symptoms.

According to the testimony of survivors, Heim euthanized patients with injections of gasoline into their hearts. He performed surgeries on otherwise healthy people. Some recalled prisoners' skulls set out on his desk to display perfect sets of teeth. Yet in the chaos of the postwar period, Heim was able to slip away from his dark past and establish himself as a reputable doctor and family man in the resort town of Baden-Baden. His story might have ended there, but for certain rare Germans who were unwilling to let Nazi war criminals go unpunished, among them a police investigator named Alfred Aedtner. After Heim fled on a tip that he was about to be arrested, Aedtner turned finding him into an overriding obsession. His quest took him across Europe and across decades, and into a close alliance with legendary Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. The hunt for Heim became a powerful symbol of Germany's evolving attitude toward the sins of its past, which finally crested in a desire to see justice done at almost any cost. <br><br>As late as 2009, the mystery of Heim&#x2019;s disappearance remained unsolved. Now, in <i>The Eternal Nazi</i>, Nicholas Kulish and Souad Mekhennet reveal for the first time how Aribert Heim evaded capture--living in a working-class neighborhood of Cairo, praying in Arabic, beloved by an adopted Muslim family--while inspiring a manhunt that outlived him by many years. It is a brilliant feat of historical detection that illuminates a nation&#x2019;s dramatic reckoning with the crimes of the Holocaust.</p><p><p>NICHOLAS KULISH was the Berlin bureau chief for the <i>New York Times</i> from 2007 to 2013. He now reports from East Africa for the <i>Times</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>SOUAD MEKHENNET is a journalist and reports for the <i>Daily Beast</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and ZDF German television.

Six years of conflict culminated with incendiary bombing raids, artillery shelling, tanks rolling through the countryside. Cities were reduced to rubble. The death and destruction Nazi Germany had visited upon the rest of Europe came home to the Reich with a vengeance. The Allies had won, but the Continent was near chaos. Europe was full of desperate souls on the move. There were caravans of displaced persons clogging the roads in every direction: forced laborers returning to Poland; prisoners of war returning to France and Britain; nearly twelve million ethnic Germans expelled from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and elsewhere, seeking refuge in Germany and Austria. Most haunting by far were the survivors of the concentration camps, who emerged from their imprisonment like walking skeletons. Soon the world realized that the crimes committed in the name of Nazi Germany went far beyond ordinary violations of the rules of war.<br><br>The Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, prepared a comprehensive list of suspected war criminals. It was known as the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, or CROWCASS. The first version of the list contained 70,000 names. By some estimates 160,000 people should have been included. The question facing the Allies was how to find and punish even those 70,000 perpetrators in the chaos of the months after Nazi capitulation. The Americans alone had to deal with some 7.7 million German military personnel in custody, including regular Wehrmacht soldiers; members of the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, the Sturmabteilung, or SA, which had played a key role in Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power; high members of government who had enacted deadly policies; and members of Hitler&#x2019;s dreaded vanguard, the Schutzstaffel, better known as the SS. Separating them proved difficult.<br><br>One clue as to who was who came from a mandatory blood-type tattoo under the left arm of all SS members. Captured soldiers were lined up and inspected for the telltale mark. But the method was not always effective. Two of the most notorious Nazi war criminals, Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele, were not detected. Seventeen people named Josef Mengele served in the German armed forces, and when captured, the Auschwitz doctor gave his last name as Memling, a famous Bavarian painter. He did not have the SS tattoo and claimed to be a regular doctor with the Wehrmacht. He ultimately fled custody, as did Eichmann. Neither was forced to stand in the dock for the postwar trials that began in Nuremberg.<br><br>The pursuit of war criminals was just one of the Allies&#x2019; responsibilities and not necessarily the most urgent. Germany was reeling from a total defeat rather than a negotiated surrender. People were starving, crops needed harvesting, and millions of POWs without jobs were released within months. The U.S. Third Army had released more than half a million prisoners by June 8; the Twelfth Army group freed an average of 30,000 prisoners a day. Meanwhile, the British sent home some 300,000 Germans as part of Operation Barleycorn, specifically so that they could save the harvest. That number grew to more than a million by August 1945 so that former soldiers could also work in mining and transport. There were untold tons of rubble to clear, bridges to rebuild, unexploded bombs to remove. The telecommunication network, postal service, highways, railways, and even local public transport systems had to be rebuilt.<br><br>On June 29, 1945, the Allied Supreme Headquarters issued Disbandment Directive No. 5, which authorized a general discharge of German prisoners not in &#x201c;automatic arrest categories&#x201d; such as SS members and war criminals. Captured soldiers were simply looked over by a doctor and given a questionnaire to fill out. Interviews were brief. If a soldier was discharged, he received half a loaf of black bread and roughly a pound of lard as rations for the journey home. With such speed and great numbers it was unavoidable that some war criminals would be among those set free.<br><br>One of the men kept in custody was Hauptsturmf�hrer Aribert Ferdinand Heim, an Austrian doctor with the Waffen-SS, the military wing of the SS that had grown into a parallel German army. Though a prisoner, he continued to serve as a doctor, treating wounded Germans at the 8279th General Hospital, near Carentan, France, about twenty miles away from Normandy&#x2019;s Omaha Beach. The hospital was actually a giant tent complex, previously an American field hospital before the United States handed it over to the Germans. When the Red Cross visited in May 1945, there were 1,417 wounded or sick soldiers there. The Red Cross inspector found the conditions to be &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; and said that German soldiers had even volunteered that the treatment there was better than it had been on the German side in the last few years of the war.<br><br>The tents could be hot during the day and frigid at night, but there were operating rooms, X-ray machines, and a laboratory. The facility was well stocked with surgical equipment and medicine, according to the Red Cross observer. In essence, the German doctors themselves ran the hospital, with four American officers overseeing their work. &#x201c;On a professional level,&#x201d; the Red Cross assessor wrote, &#x201c;the cooperation between the American and the German doctors is good.&#x201d; That included Heim. His American superiors were impressed with his skill and dependability. In a recommendation, the American captain Edward S. Jones wrote that Heim&#x2019;s work in the surgical section &#x201c;had been excellent and essential for the care of the POW patients.&#x201d;<br><br>Heim struck up friendly acquaintanceships with fellow doctors and even a German pastor, Werner Ernst Linz. The pastor observed how Heim &#x201c;practiced his medicinal arts in a very responsible manner for the well-being of the soldiers entrusted to him.&#x201d; Dr. Heim was particularly &#x201c;self-sacrificing&#x201d; in treating sexually transmitted diseases, doing everything he could to help his patients, Linz wrote in a letter of recommendation.<br><br>Though he traveled widely during the war, Heim ended up right where he had begun, in France. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Austrians had the same duty to serve as their new compatriots. Heim insisted under questioning that he had been drafted into the Waffen-SS against his will. His first assignment after earning his medical degree in Vienna at the age of twenty-five had been as a driver during the German invasion of France in 1940. Heim assisted in the resettlement of ethnic Germans in Yugoslavia and worked on earthquake relief in Romania. He had served at the frigid northern reaches of the eastern front in Norway and Finland and been wounded in action.<br><br>Just eight days after the first American soldier crossed the Rhine on March 7, 1945, Heim&#x2019;s unit was captured at Buchholz in western Germany. Heim was fortunate to find himself a prisoner of war on the American side, rather than facing a trip to Siberia courtesy of the Soviets. He was sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in France.<br><br>He was not on the CROWCASS list of wanted war criminals, but as a former member of the Waffen-SS he was in the Allied automatic arrest category, and it was not easy to secure release. Arrest and prosecution would have been certain but for an omission. For all the places Heim went over the course of the war, one post was missing from his file&#x2014;through oversight or intentional removal, it was unclear&#x2014;a small town in Austria called Mauthausen.<br><br><b>Chapter 2<br></b><br>Less than nine months after he was liberated from six years in concentration camps in Germany and Austria, Dr. Arthur A. Becker was in Vienna working as a special investigator for the U.S. Army&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigating Team 6836. He was a slender, brown-eyed fifty-five-year-old, with noticeable gaps between his teeth, born in the northern German town of Prenzlau. A writer by profession, Becker had studied pharmacology and had been living in Stuttgart when he was arrested. During his incarceration he wore the green triangle of the common criminal, but as he told the American authorities once he was freed, one of his grandfathers was Jewish. He had been arrested for making critical statements about the SS after Kristallnacht.<br><br>American war-crimes investigators struggled to build their cases quickly for trials they planned throughout their zones of occupation; they were drastically understaffed. Manpower was shifted first to the Pacific theater, where the United States was still fighting the Japanese. After the Japanese surrender, GIs were sent home as quickly as possible. Those soldiers kept to investigate war crimes were &#x201c;mostly shell-shocked tank officers who were sent to this new unit as a form of recreation and rehabilitation,&#x201d; one prosecutor recalled. &#x201c;They sat around with no idea what to do.&#x201d; The enormity of the task, as well as the language barrier, required the help of locals, and the ranks of former inmates provided enthusiastic volunteers like Becker.<br><br>On the morning of Friday, January 18, 1946, Becker had appointments in Vienna to interview other former inmates&#x2014;a man named Josef Kohl in the morning and one named August Kamhuber in the afternoon&#x2014;about the killings of Allied military personnel in violation of the Geneva Convention. Like Berlin, the Austrian capital was a divided city at the time, occupied by British, French, American, and Soviet troops, all with their own zones plus a jointly administered international zone in the first district. The investigative team Becker worked for was headquartered in Salzburg, but even the simple task of bringing witnesses from the Soviet sector required a special settlement between the increasingly mistrustful wartime allies. The Russians deemed the movement of witnesses from their zone to be &#x201c;kidnapping.&#x201d;<br><br>Much of Vienna&#x2019;s former grandeur was still obscured by wartime damage. Between the bombing raids and the final Red Army offensive to take the city, large swaths of the old first district had been demolished. In all, some eighty thousand homes had been destroyed or damaged. Displaced persons from all over Europe, including camp survivors and former slave laborers, sought refuge, adding to the housing crisis. Gas, electricity, and telephone services were disrupted, and the Viennese received permission from their occupiers to chop down many of the trees lining the city&#x2019;s once-lovely boulevards to fend off the cold of the hard postwar winter.<br><br>The shortages and rationing were nothing out of the ordinary for Josef Kohl, who had grown up poor and often gone hungry as a child. As an adult, he was bald with a tight-lipped, self-conscious smile, possibly to hide his large and slightly crooked teeth. The Austrian Communist looked more like the trained accountant he was than the street fighter he had become. Kohl took to the barricades in 1934 to fight for the Austrian republic against the fascist takeover and was shot in the chest, the bullet passing through his lung. After the Nazis absorbed Austria into the growing Third Reich, the Gestapo arrested Kohl. Following several months in the Gestapo jail at Morzinplatz in downtown Vienna, he was transferred to the infamous Dachau concentration camp on the outskirts of Munich, where he remained for a year.<br><br>One year later, in September 1939, Kohl was transferred again, this time to a year-old camp in Upper Austria. Heinrich Himmler chose the site for economic exploitation so that inmates could be used as slave labor to cut granite from the Wiener Graben stone quarry. The camp was named for the nearby town of Mauthausen. The inmates at the camp were forced, under threat of violence and even summary execution, to carry heavy stones up 186 steep stone steps cut into the hillside. Many simply died from the exertion. The inmates eventually built their own prison, unique in appearance among the concentration camps with its high stone wall and guard towers, giving their camp the look of a medieval castle.<br><br>Before the Nazis opened extermination camps in Poland, Mauthausen stood as the only Class III concentration camp in a three-tiered system. That meant that, according to the Nazis&#x2019; own rating, it was the harshest in the whole network of camps, even worse than Dachau, Buchenwald, or Auschwitz, designed for &#x201c;Vernichtung durch Arbeit,&#x201d; or extermination through work. That year more than half of the nearly sixteen thousand inmates at Mauthausen died or were killed. Kohl remained there for the entire war, almost six years in all, until liberation came in the waning days of the conflict. Now he was free, living again with his wife, Agnes, and working as the head of the branch of Volkssolidarit�t, or the People&#x2019;s Solidarity, an organization of former camp inmates.<br><br>Becker&#x2019;s interview with Kohl began at 10:55 a.m., with the witness giving his biographical information, his address on Endergasse in the Hetzendorf neighborhood south of the city center in Vienna, and his account of how he came to be held at Mauthausen. These formalities taken care of, Becker asked, &#x201c;What do you know about the abuse and murder of English or alternatively Anglo-American prisoners of war?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The first English prisoners, who jumped with parachutes into France and there procured civilian clothes for themselves, were brought to Mauthausen in 1940 and there were shot as spies,&#x201d; Kohl answered. How did Kohl know that they were English? Kohl explained that he spoke English and had talked to the men before they were executed. He went on to describe the mistreatment of the Allied pilots in July 1944, the kicks, the heads slammed against walls, and he named the members of the SS responsible.<br><br>Becker wanted to know what Kohl could tell him about the mistreatment and killing of prisoners. &#x201c;I was a clerk in the sick quarters from April 1940 to June 1941,&#x201d; Kohl said. &#x201c;As a result I was present as an eyewitness at the first killings by syringe injections.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sorts of prisoners were killed?&#x201d; Becker asked.<br><br>&#x201c;First and foremost it was those unfit for work, the weak, and the sick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you aware of any other atrocities committed by SS camp doctors?&#x201d; Becker asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Camp physician Dr. Heim had the habit of looking in the mouths of inmates to determine whether their teeth were in flawless condition. If this was the case, then he would kill the inmate by injection, cut off the head, and let it cook for hours in the crematorium until the naked skull was bared of all flesh and this skull prepared for him or his friends as decoration for their desks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else can you say about this Dr. Heim?&#x201d; Becker asked.<br><br>&#x201c;If he selected an inmate for his experiments, he took care first to question him thoroughly, in particular about the state of his family, whether they were provided for in the event that he was gone. Once he had established that, he performed operations on healthy people. He convinced them through figures of speech that it was just a small, harmless operation and that once they were recovered they would immediately be let go. Then he performed the most difficult, complicated operations such as stomach, liver&#x2014;even heart operations&#x2014;on these people that had to lead to their deaths. These people were entirely healthy human beings, and the operations were for experimental purposes,&#x201d; Kohl concluded.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know whether Dr. Heim is still alive?&#x201d; Becker asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I cannot provide any specific information about that,&#x201d; Kohl said. &#x201c;It cannot be ruled out that he is in hiding.&#x201d;</p><h2>Star Quilts</h2><p>A history of star quilts in America identifies ten basic star constructions, and includes forty full-size patterns with step-by-step instructions</p><p></p><h2>Our Second Murder</h2><p>The elderly Beagle sisters continue to operate their late brother&#39;s private detective agency in New York City.

He'd just finished examining and prescribing antibiotics for a feisty Persian cat with a bladder infection. The usually ill-mannered feline had never been his most cooperative patient, but today she'd taken a particular dislike to Jason.<br><br>He left the examining room and was greeted by Stella, his receptionist, who steered him toward his office. She wore a suspiciously silly grin, as if to say "this should be interesting."<br><br>"There's a young lady who'd like a few minutes with you," was all the information she'd give him. Her cryptic message didn't please him any more than the Persian's blatant distaste for him had.<br><br>Curious, Jason moved into his book-lined office. "Hello," he said in the friendliest voice he could muster.<br><br>"Hi." A teenage girl who seemed vaguely familiar stood as he entered the room. She glanced nervously in his direction as if he should recognize her. When it was obvious he didn't, she introduced herself. "I'm Carrie Weston." She paused, waiting expectantly.<br><br>"Hello, Carrie," Jason said. He'd seen her around, but for the life of him, couldn't recall where. "How can I help you?"<br><br>"You don't remember me, do you?"<br><br>"Ah... no." He couldn't see any point in pretending. If a cat could outsmart him, he was fair game for a teenager.<br><br>"We're neighbors. My mom and I live in the same apartment complex as you."<br><br>He did his best to smile and nod as though he'd immediately placed her, but he hadn't. He racked his brain trying to recall which apartment was hers. Although he owned and managed the building, Jason didn't interact much with his tenants. He was careful to choose renters who cared about their privacy as much as he cared about his. He rarely saw any of them other than to collect the rent, and even then most just slipped their checks under his door around the first of the month.<br><br>Carrie sat back down, her hands clenched tightly in her lap. "I&#x2014;I'm sorry to bother you, but I've been trying to talk to you for some time, and... and this seemed to be the only way I could do it without my mother finding out."<br><br>"Your mother?"<br><br>"Charlotte Weston. We live in 1-A."<br><br>Jason nodded. The Westons had been in the apartment for more than a year. Other than when they'd signed the rental agreement, Jason couldn't recall speaking to either the mother or her daughter.<br><br>"Is there a problem?"<br><br>"Not a problem... exactly." Carrie stood once again and opened her purse, taking out a thin wad of bills, which she leafed through and counted slowly. When she'd finished, she looked up at him. "It's my mother," she announced.<br><br>"Yes?" Jason prompted. He didn't have a clue where this conversation was leading or how long it would take the girl to get there. Stella knew he had a terrier waiting, yet she'd purposely routed him into his office.<br><br>"She needs a man," Carrie said, squaring her shoulders.<br><br>"I beg your pardon?" The girl had his attention now.<br><br>"My mother needs a man. I'm here to offer you one hundred dollars if you'll take her out on a date. You are single, aren't you?"<br><br>"Yes...but..." Jason was so surprised, he answered without thinking. Frankly, he didn't know whether to ask which of his brothers had put her up to this, or simply to laugh outright. He couldn't very well claim he'd never been propositioned before, but this was by far the most original instance he'd encountered in thirty-odd years.<br><br>"She's not ugly or anything."<br><br>"Ah...I'm not sure what to tell you." The girl was staring at him so candidly, so forthrightly, Jason realized within seconds it was no joke.<br><br>"I don't think my mother's happy."<br><br>Jason leaned against the side of his oak desk and crossed his arms. "Why would you assume my taking her out will make a difference?"<br><br>"I... don't know. I'm just hoping. You see, my mom and dad got divorced when I was little. I don't remember my dad, and apparently he doesn't remember me, either, because I've never heard from him. Mom doesn't say much about what went wrong, but it must've been bad because she never dates. I didn't care about that before, only now..."<br><br>"Only now what?" Jason asked when she hesitated.</p><h2>Beauty and the Beast</h2><p>Through her great capacity to love, a kind and beautiful maid releases a handsome prince from the spell which has made him an ugly beast.</p><p>Grade 1-4-- Poor Beauty! Poor Beast! de Beaumont's popular and highly romantic story of a noble, but hideously ugly beast who wins the love of gentle, kind-hearted Beauty suffers badly from poorly executed illustrations . In Howard's lengthy but smooth and coherent text, the greed and jealousy of Beauty's sisters, the consequences of the family's misfortunes, and the splendors of the Beast's palace are faithfully described in complex, stately language. A slightly ironic tone allows de Beaumont's voice to come through clearly, reflecting her "moralistic" commentary on the hypocrisy and pretentions of the society she knew. While the text is nicely modulated and suited to the story, Knight's illustrations are quite another matter, featuring vapid faces, awkward figures, and uninspired composition. In places, they misrepresent the story and, overall, they destroy any sense of drama or magic that the text provides. Beauty's father, described as "wise," looks merely foolish. The Beast, despite his pivotal importance to the story, is truly unexceptional and fails to evoke any real terror. In fact, the garish, saccharine-sweet colors give the whole book an unpleasant and inappropriately cartoonlike character.

The richly textured novel details Gutke Gurvich&#x2019;s odyssey from her apprenticeship as a midwife in a Russian shtetl to her work in the suffrage movement in New York. Interwoven with her tale is that Chava Meyer, who was attended by Gurvich at her birth and grew up to survive the pogrom that took the lives of her parents. Throughout the book, historical background plays a large part: Jewish faith and traditions, the practice of midwifery, the horrific conditions in prerevolutionary Russia and New York sweatshops, and the determined work of labor unionists and suffragists.</p><p>Elana Dykewomon's Lambda Award-winning novel <i>Beyond the Pale</i> announces itself to the world with an infant's scream--"a new voice, a tiny shofar announcing its own first year." The midwife attending this birth is Gutke Gurvich, a half-Jew with different colored eyes and a gift for seeing into the spirit world. <i>Beyond the Pale</i> is Gutke's story, detailing her odyssey from a Russian shtetl to a comfortable Manhattan brownstone. But, as Dykewomon puts it, "Whenever you tell the story of one woman, inside is another," and this rich, multilayered novel is also the story of Chava Meyer, the baby girl Gutke delivered that day, as well as the story of the important women in both of their lives: mothers, sisters, neighbors, lovers, friends. After seeing her mother raped and killed during a particularly vicious <i>progrom</i> in her native village of Kishinev, Chava immigrates to America. There, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, both she and Gutke find themselves involved in the nascent labor union and suffrage movements. Dykewomon has clearly done her research here, and <i>Beyond the Pale</i> presents a beautifully detailed account of life among turn-of-the-century immigrant Jews, from classes at the Henry Street Settlement House to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. Through the lens of several lesbians' lives, Dykewomon draws a portrait of an entire Diasporan community living through the terror and uncertainties of both Russian progroms and life in the New World.Elana Dykewomon was an editor of Sinister Wisdom from 1987 to 1995.</p><h2>Quicksilver: Terlingua and the Chisos Mining Company</h2><p>Light yellow cloth with brown and black titles on spine. 327p. including index.</p><p>Before Terlingua achieved some notoriety as the site of the annual World Championship Chili Cookoff, the ghost town was the bustling center of the mercury mining industry in the United States.

My mother always ran late and was dangerously forgetful into the bargain. You soon learned to stand aside about ten to six every evening, for it was then that she would fly in the back door, throw something in the oven, and disappear into some other quarter of the house to embark on the thousand other household tasks that greeted her each evening. In consequence she nearly always forgot about dinner until a point slightly beyond way too late.&nbsp; As a rule you knew it was time to eat when you could hear baked potatoes exploding in the oven. <br><br>We didn&#x2019;t call it the kitchen in our house. We called it the Burns Unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bit burned,&#x201d; my mother would say apologetically at every meal, presenting you with a piece of meat that looked like something &#x2014; a much-loved pet perhaps &#x2014; salvaged from a tragic house fire. &#x201c;But I think I scraped off most of the burned part,&#x201d; she would add, overlooking that this included every bit of it that had once been flesh.&nbsp; <br><br>Happily, all this suited my father.&nbsp; His palate only responded to two tastes &#x2014; burnt and ice cream &#x2014; so everything suited him so long as it was sufficiently dark and not too startlingly flavorful.&nbsp; Theirs truly was a marriage made in heaven for no one could burn food like my mother or eat it like my dad.&nbsp; <br><br>As part of her job, my mother bought stacks of housekeeping magazines &#x2014; <i>House Beautiful, House and Garden, Better Homes and Gardens</i> &#x2014; and I read these with a curious avidity, partly because they were always lying around and in our house all idle moments were spent reading something, and partly because they depicted lives so absorbingly at variance with our own. The housewives in my mother&#x2019;s magazines were so collected, so organized, so calmly on top of things, and their food was perfect &#x2014; their <i>lives</i> were perfect. They dressed up to take their food out of the oven! &nbsp;There were no black circles on the ceiling above their stoves, no mutating goo climbing over the sides of their forgotten saucepans. Children didn&#x2019;t have to be ordered to stand back every time they opened <i>their</i> oven doors.&nbsp; And their foods &#x2014; baked Alaska, lobster Newburg, chicken cacciatore &#x2014; why, these were dishes we didn&#x2019;t even dream of, much less encounter, in Iowa.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Like most people in Iowa in the 1950s, we were more cautious eaters in our house.* On the rare occasions when we were presented with food with which we were not comfortable or familiar &#x2014; on planes or trains or when invited to a meal cooked by someone who was not herself from Iowa &#x2014; we tended to tilt it up carefully with a knife and examine it from every angle as if it determining whether it might need to be defused.&nbsp; Once on a trip to San Francisco my father was taken by friends to a Chinese restaurant and he described it to us afterwards in the somber tones of someone recounting a near-death experience.&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;And they eat it with sticks, you know,&#x201d; he added knowledgeably.<br><br>&#x201c;Goodness!&#x201d; said my mother.<br><br>&#x201c;I would rather have gas gangrene than go through that again,&#x201d; my father added grimly.<br><br>In our house we didn&#x2019;t eat: <br><br>� pasta, rice, cream cheese, sour cream, garlic, mayonnaise, onions, corned beef, pastrami, salami, or foreign food of any type, except French toast; <br>� bread that wasn&#x2019;t white and at least 65 percent air; <br>� spices other than salt, pepper and maple syrup;&nbsp; <br>� fish that was any shape other than rectangular and not coated in bright orange breadcrumbs, and then only on Fridays and only when my mother remembered it was Friday, which in fact was not often; <br>� seafood of any type but especially seafood that looked like large insects;&nbsp; <br>� soups not blessed by Campbell&#x2019;s and only a very few of those; <br>� anything with dubious regional names like &#x201c;pone,&#x201d; or &#x201c;gumbo&#x201d; or foods that had at any time been an esteemed staple of slaves or peasants. <br><br>All other foods of all types &#x2014; curries, enchiladas, tofu, bagels, sushi, couscous, yogurt, kale, rocket, Parma ham, any cheese that was not a vivid bright yellow and shiny enough to see your reflection in &#x2014; had either not yet been invented or was yet unknown to us. We really were radiantly unsophisticated. I remember being surprised to learn at quite an advanced age that a shrimp cocktail was not, as I had always imagined, a pre-dinner alcoholic drink with a shrimp in it.&nbsp; <br><br>All our meals consisted of leftovers. My mother had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of foods that had already been to the table, sometimes many times.&nbsp; Apart from a few perishable dairy products, everything in the fridge was older than I was, sometimes by many years. (Her oldest food possession of all, it more or less goes without saying, was a fruitcake that was kept in a metal tin and dated from the colonial period.)&nbsp; I can only assume that my mother did all of her cooking in the 1940s so that she could spend the rest of her life surprising herself with what she could find under cover at the back of the fridge.&nbsp; I never knew her to reject a food.&nbsp; The rule of thumb seemed to be that if you opened the lid and the stuff inside didn&#x2019;t make you actually recoil and take at least one staggered step backwards, it was deemed OK to eat. <br><br>Both of my parents had grown up in the Great Depression and neither of them ever threw anything away if they could possibly avoid it.&nbsp; My mother routinely washed and dried paper plates, and smoothed out for reuse spare aluminum foil. If you left a pea on your plate, it became part of future meal. All our sugar came in little packets spirited out of restaurants in deep coat pockets, as did our jams, jellies, crackers (oyster <i>and</i> saltine), tartar sauces, some of our ketchup and butter, all of our napkins, and a very occasional ashtray; anything that came with a restaurant table really. One of the happiest moments in my parents&#x2019; life was when maple syrup started to be served in small disposable packets and they could add those to the household hoard. <br><br>*In fact like most other people in America. It is perhaps worth noting that the leading American food writer of the age, Duncan Hines, author of the hugely successful <i>Adventures in Eating</i>, declared with pride that he never ate food with French names if he could possibly help it. Hines&#x2019;s other boast was that he did not venture out of America until he was seventy years old, when he made a trip to Europe. He disliked nearly everything he found there, especially the food.</p><h2>Rising Out of Hatred: The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist</h2><p><b><b>From a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, the powerful story of how a prominent white supremacist changed his heart and mind</b></b><br><br>Derek Black grew up at the epicenter of white nationalism. His father founded Stormfront, the largest racist community on the Internet. His godfather, David Duke, was a KKK Grand Wizard. By the time Derek turned nineteen, he had become an elected politician with his own daily radio show - already regarded as the "the leading light" of the burgeoning white nationalist movement. "We can infiltrate," Derek once told a crowd of white nationalists. "We can take the country back."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he went to college. Derek had been home-schooled by his parents, steeped in the culture of white supremacy, and he had rarely encountered diverse perspectives or direct outrage against his beliefs. At New College of Florida, he continued to broadcast his radio show in secret each morning, living a double life until a classmate uncovered his identity and sent an email to the entire school. "Derek Black...white supremacist, radio host...New College student???"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ensuing uproar overtook one of the most liberal colleges in the country. Some students protested Derek's presence on campus, forcing him to reconcile for the first time with the ugliness his beliefs. Other students found the courage to reach out to him, including an Orthodox Jew who invited Derek to attend weekly Shabbat dinners. It was because of those dinners--and the wide-ranging relationships formed at that table--that Derek started to question the science, history and prejudices behind his worldview. As white nationalism infiltrated the political mainstream, Derek decided to confront the damage he had done.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising Out of Hatred</i> tells the story of how white-supremacist ideas migrated from the far-right fringe to the White House through the intensely personal saga of one man who eventually disavowed everything he was taught to believe, at tremendous personal cost. With great empathy and narrative verve, Eli Saslow asks what Derek's story can tell us about America's increasingly divided nature. This is a book to help us understand the American moment and to help us better understand one another.</p><p>Eli Saslow is a <i>Washington Post</i> staff writer and author of <i>Ten Letters: The Stories Americans Tell Their President</i>.

They walked past the protesters waving rainbow flags on the sidewalk, past the extra state troopers stationed outside the hotel lobby, past the FBI informants hoping to infiltrate their way inside. For several days, the government of greater Memphis had been working to prevent this &#x201c;white rights conference&#x201d; from taking place. One suburb declared a state of emergency so it could hire additional police officers; another issued a temporary ban on all public gatherings. But by 7:00 on Saturday morning, about 150 of the world&#x2019;s preeminent white nationalists had gathered inside a nondescript hotel conference room where a small sign hung on the wall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The fight to restore White America begins now,&#x201d; it read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The United States had elected its first black president just four days earlier, and already the Department of Homeland Security warned of a &#x201c;significant spike in activity&#x201d; on the white racist fringe. President-�elect Obama was receiving an average of thirty death threats each day. Gun sales had skyrocketed to historic levels, and by some reports far-�right militia groups had tripled their membership numbers during the last year. But the white uprising that concerned the Department of Homeland Security most of all was the one beginning now in Memphis, where acoustic guitar played through the speakers and sack lunches with turkey and swiss waited on a buffet table. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the polite face of the racist movement that now has a chance to recruit new members and broaden in scope,&#x201d; one DHS analyst said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David Duke, the conference organizer, stepped behind a podium to welcome his guests. Duke, then fifty-�eight, had spent his life working to push the white supremacist movement from the radical fringes ever closer to the far conservative Right, rebranding himself from an Imperial Wizard of the Klan into a self-�described &#x201c;racial realist&#x201d; politician who nearly became governor of Louisiana in the early 1990s. He was two decades removed from the pinnacle of his international fame, and he&#x2019;d tried to hold time in place by repackaging his old speeches into YouTube rants. He wore the tired look of a performer who&#x2019;d stayed on tour too long, but he was still the public face of white nationalism. &#x201c;The future of our movement is to become fully mainstream,&#x201d; Duke told the crowd, so he&#x2019;d reserved one of the conference&#x2019;s keynote speeches for an up-�and-�coming white nationalist leader who represented that future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to introduce the leading light of our movement,&#x201d; Duke said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anybody who has better gifts. He may have a much more extensive national and international career than I&#x2019;ve had. Derek, can you come on up?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Duke motioned to the corner of the room, where a nineteen-�year-�old community college student was hunched behind a laptop, running a live radio broadcast of the event for the online radio station he started himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We are so privileged to be with you,&#x201d; Duke said, before turning back to the audience. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, here is Derek Black.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The crowd began to applaud, and Derek stood from his computer with a slight wave and walked to the front of the room. Most of the white nationalists already knew him, because how could they not? He was at least a generation younger than almost everyone else, with shoulder-�length red hair and a large black cowboy hat that he wore in an effort to make himself more memorable. He&#x2019;d grown up within the insular world of white nationalism, attending dozens of conferences just like this one. Already he&#x2019;d built his own website for &#x201c;white children of the globe,&#x201d; visited more than half a million times. He&#x2019;d launched a twenty-�four-�hour online radio network for white nationalists and won a local election as a Republican in Florida. He was not only a prodigy within the movement but also a product of it. His father, Don Black, led the Klan for nearly a decade and then created Stormfront, the internet&#x2019;s first and largest white pride website. His mother, Chloe, had once been married to David Duke, and Duke acted as Derek&#x2019;s mentor and godfather, sometimes referring to Derek as &#x201c;the heir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No family had done more to help white nationalism bully its way back into mainstream politics, and Derek was the next step in that evolution. He was precocious, thoughtful, and polite, sometimes delivering handwritten thank-�you notes to conference volunteers. He never used racist slurs. He didn&#x2019;t advocate for outright violence or breaking the law. His core beliefs were the same as those of most white nationalists: that America would be better off as a whites-�only country, and that all minorities should eventually be forced to leave. But instead of basing his public arguments on emotion or explicit prejudice, he spoke mostly about what he believed to be the facts of racial science, immigration, and a declining white middle class. Five evenings each week, he hosted an online radio show, often devoting the first half hour to innocuous stories about his favorite country musicians like Waylon Jennings, Alan Jackson, and Johnny Cash before turning the conversation to &#x201c;the survival and continued dominance of the great white race,&#x201d; he said. His goal, he explained once on the radio, was to &#x201c;normalize these white nationalist ideas that already fit so neatly within the divides of modern society.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never lived in a country that I consider to be a white country,&#x201d; he told the audience in Memphis. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never enjoyed this good golden bag of advantage that white people are supposed to have.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He told the audience about his recent campaign to become a Republican committeeman in Palm Beach County, Florida, in which he had traveled door-�to-�door to meet with voters each afternoon after his community college German class. He seldom mentioned race in those conversations, and sometimes he barely spoke at all. Instead, he mostly listened as his white Republican neighbors told him about the reasons they felt their culture was under threat: the new highway signs in Spanish, urban crime, outsourced middle-�class jobs, a collapsing economy, and a societal insistence on political correctness. For the first time in history, less than half of all babies born in the United States were white, and Derek believed whites would inevitably begin voting more explicitly for their interests like a typical minority bloc. &#x201c;Most white people don&#x2019;t want to be called racists, but they do want to make sure their culture and their position in society isn&#x2019;t going to be undermined,&#x201d; Derek said on the radio. &#x201c;People are just waiting for white candidates to come along who are brave enough to talk about these things, and when that happens, whites will go streaming to the polls.&#x201d; Even though he had campaigned as a teenager with no job history, no college diploma, and zero political experience, Derek beat out a Cuban American incumbent and won the election with more than 60&nbsp;percent of the vote.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The way white people have to respond is through politics,&#x201d; Derek told the crowd in Memphis. &#x201c;Which way are the Republicans going to go? I&#x2019;m kind of banking on them staking their claim as the White Party. We can infiltrate. We can take the country back.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few people in the audience started to clap, and then a few more began to whistle, and before long the whole group was applauding. &#x201c;Our moment,&#x201d; Derek said, because at least in this room everyone was in agreement. They believed the core tenets of white nationalism were about to drive a political revolution. They believed, at least for the moment, that Derek would help lead it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Years from now, we will look back on this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The great intellectual move to save white people started today.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The applause continued as Don Black, fifty-�five, stood from the rows of folding chairs and moved slowly toward the lectern to join his son onstage for the next session of the conference, an audience Q&amp;A with white nationalist leaders. Don had suffered a hemorrhagic stroke a few months earlier, and now he walked with a hunch and leaned against a cane to steady his debilitated left side. He had long prided himself on being the embodiment of physical and emotional toughness&#x2014;�what he called the &#x201c;European ideal written into our genes.&#x201d; He stood over six feet tall, with thick gray hair, a hard jawline, and blue eyes. He had once been the strongest weight lifter in the rec yard of a federal prison, but now the short walk to the lectern required intermittent breaks, until Derek stepped out and offered his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don had been leaning on his only child more than ever lately, relying on him for rides to white nationalist meetings and help managing the growing business of Stormfront, which crashed under the weight of a record 120,000 users on the night of Obama&#x2019;s election to the presidency. Most of all, Don looked to Derek&#x2019;s recent political achievements to lift himself from stretches of depression and fatigue that he&#x2019;d endured since his stroke. He had tried to heal himself with physical therapy, experimental electrotherapies, and a dozen nutritional supplements, but none of it was as efficacious as monitoring Derek&#x2019;s rising fame in the local newspaper and listening to him talk each night about &#x201c;racial realities&#x201d; on internet radio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I never thought it would feel so good to play second fiddle in my own house,&#x201d; Don joked in Memphis as he and Derek took their places on the stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, standing eye to eye with Derek, Don marveled at the young adult his son was becoming. &#x201c;So perceptive. So insightful and committed in his beliefs,&#x201d; Don said. At first those beliefs had come as a direct inheritance from Don. He sent six-�year-�old Derek out for Halloween dressed as a white Power Ranger, helped to decorate his childhood bedroom with a Confederate flag, and brought him to speeches where Don expressed doubt about the full severity of the Holocaust. Derek was socialized on Stormfront, and he began spending his nights in the private chat rooms as soon as he could type. After Derek finished third grade, Don and Chloe pulled him out of school, believing the public system in West Palm Beach was overwhelmed by an influx of Haitians and Hispanics. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a shame how many white minds are wasted in that system,&#x201d; Derek wrote then, at age ten, on his own children&#x2019;s web page. &#x201c;I am no longer attacked by gangs of non-�whites. I am learning pride in myself, my family and my people.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Fossils of the Burgess Shale</h2><p>Since its discovery in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rocky Mountains has fascinated both scientists and the public with its plethora of weird wonders - life forms of the past so unfamiliar they cannot easily be assigned to known taxonomic groups. This century's most significant invertebrate fossil discovery, the Burgess Shale provides an unprecedented window into the explosive evolution during the Cambrian period that began about 540 million years ago, one of the most enigmatic episodes in the history of life. This book provides the first comprehensive set of illustrations of the extraordinary life forms revealed in the Burgess Shale.<br>In addition to the more common fossilized hard skeletons, the Burgess Shale preserved the soft parts of these organisms, which provide a key to understanding the early evolution of the major groups of animals that inhabit the earth today. The Fossils of the Burgess Shale shows much remarkable detail - including digestive tracts and other internal organs - of creatures preserved in particles of mud fine enough to penetrate every crack and unevenness. The book begins with the history of exploration and research in the Burgess Shale, the geologic setting and preservation of the fossils, and a discussion of the Cambrian radiation, the period when almost all the major phyla of animals evolved. These introductory chapters are followed by 199 high-quality photographs and line drawings with detailed species accounts that describe important features of each specimen, as well as the ecology and taxonomy of each group. A complete list of all currently accepted species described from the Burgess Shale and a comprehensive bibliography follow the illustrations.<br>The Fossil of the Burgess Shale is a compendium of fascinating Cambrian treasures that offer a rare glimpse into the nature of early life on our planet. They have figured prominently in recent evolutionary debates. The National Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 65,000 fossils collected by Walcott from the Burgess Shale, will open a new exhibition of the specimens in 1995.</p><p>Derek E. G. Briggs is a reader in paleobiology at the University of Bristol.You might think a listing of the fossils found in a single site would not be all that interesting, but the Burgess Shale collection is extraordinary. For whereas most fossilization preserves hard tissues like bones, teeth, and shells, the geologic forces that formed the Burgess Shale also preserved soft tissues. The shale's fossil animals and plants are from the Cambrian, an era long before the dinosaurs during which a remarkable array of living things came into being. The site itself, in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, was discovered early in this century. Its full import wasn't grasped for many years, but the discoveries it eventually afforded, even if they don't include <i>T. Rex</i>es, certainly rival those made by any dinosaur hunter. Although looking--as this book lets us, up close and in detail--at fossilized sponges, algae, worms, and such may not inspire another <i>Jurassic Park</i>, budding and armchair paleontologists will have a field day, even though the accompanying text is thick with technical talk. <i>Jon Kartman</i></p><h2>Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals turn to Lenin, Mao and Che</h2><p><i>Revolution In The Air</i> is the first in-depth study of the long march of the US New Left after 1968. It tells the story of the &#x2018;new communist movement&#x2019; which was the most racially integrated and fast-growing movement on the Left. Thousands of young activists, radicalized by the Vietnam War and Black Liberation, and spurred on by the Puerto Rican, Chicano and Asian-American movements, embraced a Third World oriented version of Marxism. These admirers of Mao, Che and Amilcar Cabral organized resistance to the republican majorities of Nixon and Ford.<br><br>By the 1980s these groups had either collapsed or become tiny shards of the dream of a Maoist world revolution. Taking issue with the idea of a division between an early &#x2018;good sixties&#x2019; and a later &#x2018;bad sixties,&#x2019; Max Elbaum is particularly concerned to reclaim the lessons of the new communist movement for today&#x2019;s activists who, like their sixties&#x2019; predecessors, are coming of age at a time when the Left lacks mass support and is fragmented along racial lines.</p><p><b>Max Elbaum</b> was a member of Students for a Democratic Society and a leader of one of the main new communist movement organizations.

Grounded in the author's decades of practice as a Rolfer and Zen meditator, the book offers a first-of-its-kind three-step method for training practitioners how to <i>see holistically</i>, given the enormously important role perception plays in assessing clients. By exposing many of the unconscious philosophical assumptions that occlude our understanding the depths of manual therapy,&nbsp;<i>Embodied Being</i>&nbsp;promises to illuminate the full scope of body-mind healing, from the point of view of both the practitioner and the person receiving the work.<br><br><i>Embodied Being</i> states the principles of intervention and shows practitioners how to use them to answer three fundamental questions common to all forms of therapy:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What do I do first?</i><br> <i>What do I do next? </i>and<br> <i>When am I finished?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Perplexed that most practitioners are unable to answer these questions and simply rely on their intuition, Maitland sets out to define what makes a truly life-altering bodywork session, drawing on his understanding of Goethe, Merleau-Ponty, and other great thinkers. Maitland proposes that the holistic approach in bodywork is capable of creating new possibilities for the future by erasing the patterns that bind us to a dysfunctional past. Such sessions can so profoundly reshape the body that there is no longer any room for emotional torment--thus manual therapy can free bodies of physical pain, releasing the innate joy within the core of all human beings. Ultimately, giving and receiving manual therapy teaches both practitioners and clients how to move with grace, open their hearts, and touch the numinous.</p><p>Jeffrey Maitland, PhD, has spent most of his adult life deeply investigating Zen practice, philosophy, and the nature of healing. He is a Zen monk ordained by Joshu Sasaki Roshi, an energy healer, a Certified Advanced Rolfer (one of seven certified Advanced Rolfing instructors in the world), a former professor of philosophy at Purdue University, and philosophical counselor. With 30-plus years of experience and 5,000 hours of training, Dr. Maitland is a Board Certified Diplomate of the American Academy of Pain Management. He employs a gentle, nonformulaic approach to Rolfing and is highly skilled in visceral manipulation, biodynamic craniosacral, energetic, and cold laser therapy. Internationally known as an author, instructor, innovator, and expert in soft tissue manipulation, his advice is often sought by other professionals. Maitland teaches workshops and classes in myofascial manipulation to physical therapists and other healthcare professionals. Maitland has published and presented many papers on the theory of somatic manual therapy, Zen, philosophy, and Rolfing. His research, articles, and book reviews are published in numerous professional journals."As a trained philosopher, Rolfing instructor, and Zen monk, Dr. Maitland travels far in this book&#x2014;from the breadth and depth of philosophy's elegant language and arguments to down-to-earth plain-speak that often surprised me with words that quickly turned complexity into what is simple and relevant." <br><b>&#x2014;from the Foreword by Judith S. Freilich, MD</b> <br><br>"Jeffrey Maitland has explored the pivotal fusion of mind, body, and planet, as he provides keys to the underlying meaning and context of somatic therapy.

Robert Low</h2><p><p>Life is savage aboard a Viking raider. When young Orm Rurikson is plucked from the snows of Norway to join his estranged father on the Fjord Elk, he becomes an unlikely member of a notorious crew. They are the Oathsworn - so named after the spoken bond that ties them in brotherhood - and they ply a casual trade on the ocean wave, selling their swords to the highest bidder.But times are changing. Loyalty to the old Norse Gods is fading, and the followers of the mysterious 'White Christ' are gaining power across Europe. Hired as relic-hunters by the merchant rulers of a bustling city, the Oathsworn are sent in search of a legendary sword of untold value to the new religion. With only a young girl as guide, their quest will lead them onto the deep and treacherous waters of the 'whale road', toward the cursed treasure of Attila the Hun. And to a challenge that will test the very bond that holds them together.A significant new voice in historical fiction, Robert Low has created a startlingly modern tale in the style of the great Viking sagas. A heady mix of powerful suspense, blockbuster battles and religious intrigue, THE WHALE ROAD is a must for fans of Bernard Cornwell and Tim Severin. It heralds a major new series sure to hook old and new readers alike.</p></p><p><p>Robert Low has been a journalist and writer since the age of 17. He covered the wars in Vietnam, Sarajevo, Romania and Kosovo until common-sense and the concerns of his wife and daughter prevailed.To satisfy his craving for action, having moved to an area rich in Viking tradition, he took up re-enactment, joining The Vikings. He now spends summers fighting furiously in helmet and mail in shieldwalls all over Britain and winters training hard.</p>British journalist Low's debut novel is a rousing, sprawling saga of Viking warriors and the quest for hidden treasure. The adventure begins in A.D. 965, when 15-year-old Orm Ruriksson&#x2014;aka Orm the Bear Slayer&#x2014;joins the Oathsworn, a band of raiders that includes his father, Rurik, and is led by the ruthless Einar the Black. After hearing a tale about a mountain of silver that once belonged to Attila the Hun, the band sets out to find it, accompanied by a madwoman who claims to know the treasure's location. The daunting journey becomes more treacherous as competitors also race for the prize. Bluetooth, the King of the Danes and the Norwegians, covets the treasure for himself, and an unscrupulous Catholic monk joins the chase, not for the silver but for the Spear of Destiny&#x2014;the spear that pierced Christ's side on the cross and was later forged into Attila's sword. Low mixes history, archeology, mythology and nonstop, often-sanguinary action into a fast-moving adventure tale. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Produced in the tiny, picturesque town of Ahus, Sweden, Absolut came to America a complete unknown. In the early efforts to establish the brand&#39;s identity, the creators realized the now-famous two-word headlines would showcase the &#34;absolute&#34; quality of the brand, but Absolut would also be unpretentious, and not take itself - or the world - too seriously.

The keen-eyed Nella Last shops assiduously at Barrow Market as austerity and rationing gradually give way to relative abundance; housewife Judy Haines, relishing the detail of suburban life, brings up her children in Chingford; and, the self-absorbed civil servant Henry St John perfects the art of grumbling. These and many other voices give a rich, unsentimental picture of everyday life in the 1950s. We also encounter well-known figures on the way, such as Doris Lessing (joining and later leaving the Communist Party), John Arlott (sticking up on Any Questions? for the rights of homosexuals) and Tiger&#39;s Roy of the Rovers (making his goal-scoring debut for Melchester). All this is part of a colourful, unfolding tapestry, in which the great national events - the Tories returning to power, the death of George VI, the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the Suez Crisis - jostle alongside everything that gave Britain in the 1950s its distinctive flavour: Butlin&#39;s holiday camps, Kenwood food mixers, &#34;Hancock&#39;s Half-Hour,&#34; Ekco television sets, Davy Crockett, skiffle and teddy boys. Deeply researched, David Kynaston&#39;s &#34;Family Britain&#34; offers an unrivalled take on a largely cohesive, ordered, still very hierarchical society gratefully starting to move away from the painful hardships of the 1940s towards domestic ease and affluence.</p><p>David Kynaston was born in Aldershot in 1951. He has been a professional historian since 1973 and has written fifteen books, including The City of London (1994-2001), a widely acclaimed four-volume history, and W.G.&#39;s Birthday Party, an account of the Gentleman vs. the Players at Lord&#39;s in July 1898. He is the author of Austerity Britain, 1945-51, the first title in a series of books covering the history of post-war Britain (1945-1979) under the collective title &#39;Tales of a New Jerusalem&#39;. He is currently a visiting professor at Kingston University.Starred Review. Following U.K. bestseller <i>Austerity Britain 1945&#x2013;1951</i>, this is the second title in historian Kynaston's series on postwar Britain. It was an eventful time. A BBC survey conducted after King George VI's death in 1952 found the lower classes were upset that news of his death disrupted their favorite radio programs. The media was saturated with news of Elizabeth II's coronation as well as Princess Margaret's affair with a divorced man. The new Tory Home Secretary gave prosecuting homosexuals the highest priority; the end of meat and butter rationing in 1954 after 14 years caused jubilation; there was a 1955 national rail strike; and Ruth Ellis swung from the gallows for murdering her cheating, abusive socialite lover. Kynaston makes excellent use of personal diaries from housewives, civil servants, and the famous, all struggling with personal lives as they voice opinions on issues of the day (priceless letters by novelist Kingsley Amis show him knocking Dylan Thomas to poet Philip Larkin).

After the defeat of the French Army and Britain's retreat from the Continent in June 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill created the top-secret espionage operation to "set Europe ablaze." The agents infiltrated Nazi-occupied territory, parachuting behind enemy lines and hiding in plain sight, quietly but forcefully recruiting, training, and arming local French <i>r�sistants</i> to attack the German war machine. SOE would not only change the course of the war, but the nature of combat itself. Of the many brave men and women conscripted, two Anglo-American recruits, the Starr brothers, stood out to become legendary figures to the guerillas, assassins, and saboteurs they led.<br><br>While both brothers were sent across the channel to organize against the Germans, their fates in war could hardly have been more different. Captain George Starr commanded networks of <i>r�sistants</i> in southwest France, cutting German communications, destroying weapons factories, and delaying the arrival of Nazi troops to Normandy by seventeen days after D-Day. Younger brother Lieutenant John Starr laid groundwork for resistance in the Burgundy countryside until he was betrayed, captured, tortured, and imprisoned by the Nazis in France and sent to a series of concentration camps in Germany and Austria. Feats of boldness and bravado were many, but appalling scandals, including George's supposed torture and execution of Nazis prisoners, and John's alleged collaboration with his German captors, overshadowed them all. At the war's end, Britain, France, and the United States awarded both brothers medals for heroism, and George would become one of only three among thousands of SOE operatives to achieve the rank of colonel. Yet, their battle honors did little to allay postwar allegations against them, and when they returned to England, their government accused both brothers of heinous war crimes.<br><br>Here, for the first time, is the story of one of the great clandestine organizations of World War II, and of two heroic brothers whose ordeals during and after the war challenged the accepted myths of Britain's wartime resistance in occupied France. Written with complete and unrivaled access to only recently declassified documents from Britain's SOE files, French archives, family letters, diaries, and court records, along with interviews from surviving wartime Resistance fighters, <i>They Fought Alone</i> is a real-life thriller. Renowned journalist and war correspondent Charles Glass exposes a dramatic tale of spies, sabotage, and the daring men and women who risked everything to change the course of World War II.</p><p>Charles Glass was the Chief Middle East Correspondent for ABC News from 1983 to 1993 and has covered wars in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans.

He has written articles for cultural and environmental publications, and lives in New Delhi, India.Patnaik ( A Desert Kingdom: The Rajputs of Bakur ), who is the brother of the novelist Gita Mehta, gives us a unusual and pictorially lovely survey of which natural plants, herbs, fruits and essences are known in India to offer balm to the ill. Ginger, says the author, will help one to recover from motion sickness, and it wards off the build-up of cholesterol; plantain leaves can be applied to wounds; hemp fights migraines. Then, of course, there is the lotus, both real and mythical in power, and a central symbol in kundalini yoga: while various potions can be wrung from it, its beauty alone is "considered a medicine." The mango, too, has many purposes: the twigs can serve as "antiseptic" toothbrushes, while the seeds successfully thwart dysentery. Sandalwood paste can "tranquilize a believer"; drunken, it will soothe ulcers. This lore is copious and well told, and the pictures, commissioned by Patnaik from eight Indian artists "to reflect a cross section of Indian art," are outstanding: delicate yet lush, they seem to ease pain, too. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Primer of Italian Fascism (European Horizons)</h2><p><i>A Primer of Italian Fascism</i> makes available for the first time in English translation the key documents pertaining to one of our century&#x2019;s defining mass political movements. Whereas existing anthologies survey Fascist writings in a multiplicity of national settings, <i>A Primer of Italian Fascism</i> opts for a tightly focused, in-depth approach that emphasizes the development of Fascist ideology in the country of its birth.&nbsp;Historically speaking, Italian Fascism was the original Fascism. The model for subsequent movements including Nazism, Falangism, and Integralism, Italian Fascism set out to define a &#x201c;third way&#x201d; to modernization known as &#x201c;corporatism.&#x201d; <i>A Primer of Italian Fascism</i> situates the rise and fall of corporatist ideals within the framework of the actual history of Mussolini&#x2019;s movement and regime. It includes not only classic doctrinal statements such as Mussolini&#x2019;s &#x201c;Foundations and Doctrine of Fascism&#x201d; and writings by corporatist theorists such as Bottai, Pellizzi, Rocco, and Spirito, but also an array of fundamental political and juridical documents, including the party platforms adopted by the Fascist combat brigades, the 1938 Manifesto of Race, the 1940 Manifesto of Verona, and the Fascist labor and school charters. By making available such an extensive array of source texts, <i>A Primer of Italian Fascism</i> aims to open up for the English reader a more complex and complete vision of Fascism, both in Italy and beyond.</p><p>Jeffrey T.

First they provide a balanced survey of the nature and doctrines of Fascism. Yet just as important is the light they throw upon Italian institutions and the working of the Italian mind. Alexander De Grand, who is Professor of History at North Carolina State University, disagrees with some other contemporary scholars in that he sees Fascism as a bourgeois response to the challenge of proletarian revolution.

Silverman)</p><p></p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p>I HAVE HAD MANY, many teachers along my path to understanding the mentality and behavior of abusive men. Before I can name names, however, I need to thank above all the hundreds of female partners and ex-partners of my clients who have shared their stories with me and who have thereby shed light on the denial and distortions running through my clients&#x2019; accounts of events. The survivors of abuse have been my greatest educators; if we could hear their voices much more, and the voices of the abusers and their allies much less, the world would move rapidly to eliminate the chronic mistreatment that so many women currently face in their intimate relationships.</p><p>My early colleagues at Emerge have a unique responsibility for setting me on the course that has brought me here: David Adams, Susan Cayouette, Ted German, Magueye Seck, Chuck Turner, Charlene Allen, and Jim Ptacek. In addition to being such a pleasure to work with, this group provided me with indispensable intellectual support and stimulation; I hope I was able to return some reasonable part of what they offered me.</p><p>Equally important to the growth of my understanding of abusive men, and of their impact on their partners and children, was Carole Sousa, who simultaneously educated us at Emerge and kept us honest. Her criticisms of our blind spots were often annoying, mostly because of how right they were. No single person has contributed more to the understandings that I am now sharing. I need further to thank Carole for generously reviewing the manuscript for this book and marking her comments (important ones, as usual) with dozens of sticky tabs. Her suggestions have strengthened this book in critical ways.</p><p>Other important influences on my insight into controlling and angry men and the destructive trail they leave behind them include Lonna Davis, Pam Whitney, Isa Woldeguiorguis, Susan Schechter, Sarah Buel, Jim Hardeman, Janet Fender, and Brenda Lopez. I would also like to express my appreciation to Jeff Edleson, Claire Renzetti, Jackson Katz, Peter Jaffe, Barbara Hart, Bonnie Zimmer, Elaine Alpert, Joan Zorza, Jennifer Juhler, Stephanie Eisenstat, Range Hutson, Scott Harshbarger, and Maureen Sheeran for their contributions to my learning about abuse and oppression and for their professional support and encouragement. Kate O&#x2019;Kane contributed by providing me with a beautiful and relaxing place to write during the day.</p><p>I also need to acknowledge how much I have learned from my clients themselves over the years, but it would not be appropriate for me to thank them, since without their abuse of women the writing of this book would be unnecessary.</p><p>I am grateful to Gillian Andrews, Carlene Pavlos, Jay Silverman, Steve Holmes, Catherine Benedict, Gail Dines, Carrie Cuthbert, and Kim Slote for their combination of personal support and intellectual/professional stimulation and assistance over the years. Gillian and Gail in particular have both kept after me for years to write this book, and it is largely due to their continued prodding that it is finally here; Gillian also provided invaluable comments and suggestions on the manuscript. My family, too, has been loving and supportive (and tolerant) during the time-consuming and sometimes stressful writing process; I love you and thank you more than I can say for carrying me along.</p><p>I owe tremendous gratitude to my agent, Wendy Sherman, who not only found a home for this book but also played a major role in forming the original concept and guiding its direction. A writer could not be in better hands. My appreciation also goes to Deb Futter at Doubleday who led me to Wendy. My editor at Putnam, Jeremy Katz, has had unshakable faith in this project from the beginning and has helped me through several moments of anxiety or hesitation. It fell to Jeremy to let my wagonloads of text dump down upon him so that he could stir it all around and figure out how to shape it into a presentable whole. I also wish to express appreciation to other people at Putnam who supported and worked on this book, including AnnMarie Harris, Denise Silvestro, Marilyn Ducksworth, and Brenda Goldberg.</p><p>Finally, I want to express my deep gratitude to three people who don&#x2019;t know me but whose work has inspired and sustained me for years: Bruce Cockburn, Mercedes Sosa, and Linda Hogan. Perhaps our paths will yet cross.</p><p></p><p>Lundy Bancroft<br>Winter 2002</p><p></p><p>Note on Terminology</p><p>IN REFERRING TO angry and controlling men in this book, I have chosen to use in most cases the shorter terms <i>abusive man</i> and <i>abuser</i>. I have used these terms for readability and not because I believe that every man who has problems with angry or controlling behaviors is abusive. I needed to select a simple word I could apply to any man who has recurring problems with disrespecting, controlling, insulting, or devaluing his partner, whether or not his behavior also involves more explicit verbal abuse, physical aggression, or sexual mistreatment. Any of these behaviors can have a serious impact on a woman&#x2019;s life and can lead her to feel confused, depressed, anxious, or afraid. So even if your partner is not an abuser, you will find that much of what is described in the pages ahead can help to clarify for both of you the problems in your relationship and what steps you can take to head in a more satisfying, supportive, and intimate direction. If you are not sure whether your partner&#x2019;s behavior should be called <i>abuse</i> or not, turn to Chapter 5, which will help you sort out the distinctions.</p><p>At the same time, remember that even if your partner&#x2019;s behavior doesn&#x2019;t fit the definition of abuse, it may still have a serious effect on you. Any coercion or disrespect by a relationship partner is an important problem. Controlling men fall on a <i>spectrum</i> of behaviors, from those who exhibit only a few of the tactics I describe in this book to those who use almost all of them. Similarly, these men run a gamut in their attitudes, from those who are willing to accept confrontation about their behaviors and strive to change them, to those who won&#x2019;t listen to the woman&#x2019;s perspective at all, feel completely justified, and become highly retaliatory if she attempts to stand up for herself. (In fact, as we see in Chapter 5, one of the best ways to tell how deep a man&#x2019;s control problem goes is by seeing how he reacts when you start demanding that he treat you better. If he accepts your grievances and actually takes steps to change what he does, the prospects for the future brighten somewhat.) The level of anger exhibited by a controlling man also shows wide variation, but unfortunately it doesn&#x2019;t tell us much in itself about how psychologically destructive he may be or how likely he is to change, as we will see.</p><p>In addition, I have chosen to use the terms <i>he</i> to refer to the abusive person and <i>she</i> to the abused partner. I selected these terms for convenience and because they correctly describe the great majority of relationships in which power is being abused. However, control and abuse are also a widespread problem in lesbian and gay male relationships, and the bulk of what I describe in this book is relevant to same-sex abusers.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH angry and controlling men for fifteen years as a counselor, evaluator, and investigator, and have accumulated a wealth of knowledge from the two thousand or more cases with which I have been involved. I have learned the warning signs of abuse and control that a woman can watch out for early in a relationship. I&#x2019;ve come to know what a controlling man is <i>really</i> saying, the meaning that is hidden behind his words. I&#x2019;ve seen clues to recognizing when verbal and emotional aggression are heading toward violence. I&#x2019;ve found ways to separate out abusive men who are faking change from those who are doing some genuine work on themselves. And I have learned that the problem of abusiveness has surprisingly little to do with how a man <i>feels</i>&#x2014;my clients actually differ very little from nonabusive men in their emotional experiences&#x2014;and everything to do with how he <i>thinks.</i> The answers are inside his mind.</p><p>However, as delighted as I am to have had the opportunity to gain this insight, <i>I am not one of the people who most needs it.</i> The people who can best benefit from knowledge about abusers and how they think are <i>women</i>, who can use what I have learned to help themselves recognize when they are being controlled or devalued in a relationship, to find ways to get free of abuse if it is happening, and to know how to avoid getting involved with an abusive man&#x2014;or a controller or a user&#x2014;next time. The purpose of this book is to equip women with the ability to protect themselves, physically and psychologically, from angry and controlling men.</p><p>To prepare for writing this book, I first generated a list of the twenty-one questions that women most often ask me about their abusive partners, questions such as:</p><p></p><p><i>&#x201c;Is he really sorry?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Why do so many of our friends side with him?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Is he going to hit me some day?&#x201d;</i></p><p></p><p>and many others. I then built my explanations around these concerns, to make sure that women would be able to look here to find the information they urgently need. You will find these twenty-one questions highlighted as you go through this book; you might want to flip through the pages for a moment now just to grab a quick glimpse of where I have addressed the issues that are most pressing for you.</p><p>Another central goal of mine is to offer assistance to each woman who is struggling with how she is being treated in a relationship, regardless of what label she may put on her partner&#x2019;s behavior. Words like <i>control</i> and <i>abuse</i> can be loaded ones, and you may not feel that they fit your particular circumstances. I have chosen to use the term <i>abusers</i> to refer to men who use a wide range of controlling, devaluing, or intimidating behaviors. In some cases I am talking about physical batterers and at other times about men who use or insult their partners but never frighten or intimidate them. Some of the men I describe in the pages ahead change moods so drastically and so often that a woman could never feel sure <i>what</i> they are like, much less attach a label. Your partner may be arrogant, or may play mind games, or may act selfishly over and over again, but his better aspects may make you feel that he is miles away from being an &#x201c;abuser.&#x201d; Please don&#x2019;t let my language put you off; I have simply chosen the word <i>abuser</i> as a shorthand way of saying &#x201c;men who chronically make their partners feel mistreated or devalued.&#x201d; You can adopt a different term if you know one that fits your partner better. But whatever style of mistreatment your partner uses, rest assured that you will find in these pages the answers to many questions that have perplexed you.</p><p>If the person you are involved with is the same sex as you are, you have a place here too. Lesbians and gay men who abuse their partners exhibit much of the same thinking, and most of the same tactics and excuses, that abusive heterosexual men do. In this book I have used the term <i>he</i> for the abuser and <i>she</i> for the abused partner to keep my discussions simple and clear, but abused lesbians and gay men are very much in my thoughts, right alongside of abused straight women. Of course, you will need to change the gender language to fit your relationship, for which I apologize in advance. You will also find a section in Chapter 6 where I speak specifically about the similarities and differences in same-sex abusers.</p><p>Similarly, this book includes stories of men from a very wide range of racial and cultural backgrounds. Although the attitudes and behaviors of controlling and abusive men vary somewhat from culture to culture, I have found that their similarities greatly outweigh their differences. If your partner is a person of color or an immigrant, or if you are a member of one of these groups yourself, you will find that much of what this book discusses, or perhaps all of it, fits your experience quite well. While I have not specified race or ethnicity in the cases I describe in these pages, roughly one-third of the abusers whose stories I tell are men of color or men from nations outside of North America. I further discuss some specific racial and cultural issues in Chapter 6.</p><p>MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH ANGRY AND CONTROLLING MEN</p><p>I began counseling abusive men individually and in groups in 1987, while working for a program called Emerge, the first agency in the United States to offer specialized services for men who abuse women. For roughly the next five years I worked almost exclusively with clients who were coming to the program voluntarily. They generally attended under heavy pressure from their female partners, who were either talking about leaving the relationship or had already done so. In many cases, the woman had gone to court to seek a restraining order legally barring the man from the home and in many cases ordering him to stay away from the woman altogether. The men&#x2019;s main motivation for seeking counseling was the hope of saving their relationships. It was common for them to feel some guilt or discomfort about their abusive behavior, but they simultaneously believed strongly in the validity of their excuses and justifications, so their feelings of remorse would not have been enough in themselves to have kept them in my program. In those early years, the clients I worked with were men who used far more verbal and emotional abuse than physical violence, although most of them had been physically intimidating or assaultive on at least a few occasions.</p><p>During the 1990s the legal system became much more involved than it had been in the past in responding to domestic abuse, with the result that court-mandated clients started at first to trickle and then to pour in the doors of our program. These men often had a much greater propensity for physical violence than our earlier clients, sometimes involving the use of weapons or vicious beatings resulting in the hospitalization of their partners. Yet we observed that in other ways these men were generally not significantly different from our verbally abusive clients: their attitudes and excuses tended to be the same, and they used mental cruelty side by side with their physical assaults. Equally important was that the female partners of these battering men were largely describing the same distresses in their lives that we were hearing about from women who had been psychologically abused, showing us that different forms of abuse have similar destructive impacts on women.</p><p>Throughout my years of working with controlling and abusive men, my colleagues and I have been strict about always speaking to the woman whom our client has mistreated, whether or not the couple is still together. (And if he has started a new relationship, we talk with his current partner as well, which is part of how we became aware of the ways in which abusive men continue their patterns from one relationship to the next.)...</p></p><h2>Chronicles of Border Warfare</h2><p>The book may have numerous typos or missing text.

When Philip VI came to the throne, in 1328, France was a weak country, with much of its modern area under English rule. Victory in the Hundred Years' War, and the acquisition of Brittany and much of Burgundy, combined with a large population and taxable wealth, made the France of Francis I the only power in Europe capable of rivalling the empire of Charles V. Francis displayed his power by spectacular artistic patronage and aggressive foreign wars. Following the death of Henry II in a tournament, the problems of two royal minorities and the divisive forces of the Reformation led to the temporary eclipse of royal power. When the last Valois, Henry III, was stabbed to death by a Dominican Friar in 1589, the dynasty was already discredited but the monarchy survived intact.</p></p><p>Robert Knecht is Emeritus Professor of French History at Birmingham University and a leading authority on early modern French history.

Having to take stints as an endangered species biologist, English teacher, and handyman to help pay off his accumulating debts, he questioned the logic of this losing enterprise, but never lost his fierce love of the Great Plains. So when a neighboring buffalo rancher invites him to lend a hand at the annual buffalo roundup, O&#x2019;Brien comes face to face with these mammoth, impressive creatures, and the seeds are planted for converting his own ranch from cattle to buffalo. Starting with thirteen calves, "short-necked, golden balls of wool," O&#x2019;Brien embarks on a journey that returns buffalo to his land for the first time in more than a century and a half.<br><br>In <b>BUFFALO FOR THE BROKEN HEART</b>, Dan O&#x2019;Brien, a writer possessed of &#x201c;a keen and poetic eye&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), ranges freely under the big western sky, bringing the Great Plains to life in clear and vibrant prose. Whether he&#x2019;s describing the grazing pattern of the buffalo (moving quickly from one pasture to another, thereby maintaining the diversity of the grasses), the ancient thrill of watching a falcon hone in on its prey, or the comical spectacle of a buffalo bull wallowing in the mud, O&#x2019;Brien brings together a novelist&#x2019;s eye for detail with an ecologist&#x2019;s understanding to create an entertaining and enriching narrative.<br><br>At once a heartfelt account of his struggles at the Broken Heart, a short history of the buffalo and its near extinction, and an engaging lesson in wildlife ecology, <b>BUFFALO FOR THE BROKEN HEART</b> illustrates the power of a dream and how life becomes infinitely richer when we dare to follow one. This is Dan O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s greatest achievement to date, placing him firmly in the canon of other great writers on nature such as Annie Dillard and Peter Matthiessen.</p><p>Some 20 years ago, Dan O'Brien, intoxicated by the Black Hills region of South Dakota, purchased the Broken Heart Ranch and began running cattle on more than a thousand acres. Though the decision ultimately cost him his marriage and, at times, his peace of mind, he feels a connection to the land and the lifestyle that continues to justify the decision. When necessary, he has even worked as an endangered-species biologist or English teacher in order to support his ranching habit. His engaging book, <i>Buffalo for the Broken Heart</i>, details both the rebirth of his ranch as well as himself. <p> "Desperate to rediscover purpose" in his life and disillusioned with working like a serf for the bank while supporting cows--those lumbering, small-brained icons of the plains that O'Brien describes as "a sort of reverse beast of burden. <i>I</i> was carrying <i>them</i>!"--he made a snap decision one day in January 1998 to take in 13 orphaned buffalo calves from a fellow rancher. Later, after much soul searching and contemplation of both practical and emotional matters, he decided to jump headlong into buffalo ranching. He expected differences between the two animals, of course, but was pleasantly surprised by the buffalo's self-sufficiency. Since buffalo are native to the plains, they are much gentler on the land and are able to find most of their own food and water. Plus, their meat is healthier than beef (and delicious to boot), and buffalo do not need the heavy doses of antibiotics, steroids, and hormones that cattle require--a process O'Brien likens to "locking children in a room with ice cream and potato chips and treating the health problems that result with expensive medicine."</p><p> O'Brien is a splendid storyteller, and his narrative is a skillful weave of the history of the buffalo on the Great Plains, colorful portraits of fellow ranchers, descriptions of the plains' rugged beauty, and a clear-eyed account of the harsh realities of ranching in this unforgiving landscape. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>"A wonderful book. Artful, lucid, down-to-earth, poetic, and entertaining, <b>BUFFALO FOR THE BROKEN HEART</b> is a tale told with uncommon gentleness, decency, and discretion, much humor, and real wisdom.

A classic."<br>&#x2014;John Nichols, author of <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i><br><br>"This book is a phoenix, a thing of beauty rising from the ashes of loss.

He looks at the issue of child abuse--very much a reality, though the idea of child abuse is a social product. He also cautiously examines the ways in which advanced research on new weapons influences not the content but the form of science. In conclusion, Hacking comments on the "culture wars" in anthropology, in particular a spat between leading ethnographers over Hawaii and Captain Cook. Written with generosity and gentle wit by one of our most distinguished philosophers of science, this wise book brings a much needed measure of clarity to current arguments about the nature of knowledge. </p></p><p>Lost in the raging debate over the validity of social construction is the question of what, precisely, is being constructed.

But then, to design and produce a yarn with the properties you intended, a holistic approach, considering all the factors contributing to a yarn's properties, is desirable. And that's a lot of information. Before moving on to yarn design, this book covers the qualities of many protein, cellulose and manufactured fibres (spider silk, anyone?), methods for analysing existing yarns, and spinning techniques from fibre preparation to singles creation, plying and cabling. The spinning techniques covered in the second part of the book are simply inspirational. The drafting methods alone will keep an improving spinner happily practising for hours, and the wheel adjustment flowchart is definitely a go-to reference. The plying, cabling and design section is so rich, so detailed, that a single reading (or two, or three) simply isn't enough to absorb all it has to offer. Techniques are described clearly and illustrated with step-by-step photographs. Four projects complete the book nicely, each requiring a particular type of handspun yarn, designed to encourage you to put the principles of the book into practice...

His destination was a terrace of ill-lit Victorian boarding-houses with names like Bel-a-Vista, The Commodore and Eureka. In build he was powerful but stately, a representative of something. His stride was agile, his body forward-sloping in the best tradition of the Anglo-Saxon administrative class. In the same attitude, whether static or in motion, Englishmen have hoisted flags over distant colonies, discovered the sources of great rivers, stood on the decks of sinking ships. He had been travelling in one way or another for sixteen hours but he wore no overcoat or hat. He carried a fat black briefcase of the official kind and in the other hand a green Harrods bag. A strong sea wind lashed at his city suit, salt rain stung his eyes, balls of spume skimmed across his path. Pym ignored them. Reaching the porch of a house marked "No Vacancies" he pressed the bell and waited, first for the outside light to go on, then for the chains to be unfastened from inside. While he waited a church clock began striking five. As if in answer to its summons Pym turned on his heel and stared back at the square. At the graceless tower of the Baptist church posturing against the racing clouds. At the writhing monkey-puzzle trees, pride of the ornamental gardens. At the empty bandstand. At the bus shelter. At the dark patches of the side streets. At the doorways one by one. </p><p> "Why Mr. Canterbury, it's you," an old lady's voice objected sharply as the door opened behind him. "You bad man. You caught the night sleeper again, I can tell. Why ever didn't you telephone?" </p><p> "Hullo, Miss Dubber," said Pym. "How are you?" </p><p> "Never mind how I am, Mr. Canterbury. Come in at once. You'll catch your death." </p><p> But the ugly windswept square seemed to have locked Pym in its spell. "I thought Sea View was up for sale, Miss D," he remarked as she tried to pluck him into the house. "You told me Mr. Cook moved out when his wife died. Wouldn't set foot in the place, you said." </p><p> "Of course he wouldn't. He was allergic. Come in this instant, Mr. Canterbury, and wipe your feet before I make your tea." </p><p> "So what's a light doing in his upstairs bedroom window?" Pym asked as he allowed her to tug him up the steps. </p><p> Like many tyrants Miss Dubber was small. She was also old and powdery and lopsided, with a crooked back that rumpled her dressing-gown and made everything round her seem lopsided too. </p><p> "Mr. Cook has rented out the upper flat, Celia Venn has taken it to paint in. That's you all over." She slid a bolt. "Disappear for three months, come back in the middle of the night and worry about a light in someone's window." She slid another. "You'll never change, Mr. Canterbury. I don't know why I bother." </p><p> "Who on earth is Celia Venn?" </p><p> "Dr. Venn's daughter, silly. She wants to see the sea and paint it." Her voice changed abruptly. "Why Mr. Canterbury, how dare you? Take that off this instant." </p><p> With the last bolt in place Miss Dubber had straightened up as best she could and was preparing herself for a reluctant hug. But instead of her customary scowl, which nobody believed in for a moment, her poky little face had twisted in fright. </p><p> "Your horrid black tie, Mr. Canterbury. I won't have death in the house, I won't have you bring it. Who is it for?" </p><p> Pym was a handsome man, boyish but distinguished. In his early fifties he was in his prime, full of zeal and urgency in a place that knew none. But the best thing about him in Miss Dubber's view was his lovely smile that gave out so much warmth and truth and made her feel right. </p><p> "Just an old Whitehall colleague, Miss D. No one to flap about. No one close." </p><p> "Everyone's close at my age, Mr. Canterbury. What was his name?" </p><p> "I hardly knew the fellow," said Pym emphatically, untying his tie and slipping it into his pocket. "And I'm certainly not going to tell you his name and have you hunting the obituaries, so there." His eye as he said this fell on the visitors' book, which lay open on the hall table beneath the orange nightlight that he had fitted to her ceiling on his last visit. "Any casuals at all, Miss D?" he asked as he scanned the list. "Runaway couples, mystery princesses? What happened to those two lover-boys who came at Easter?" </p><p> "They were not lover-boys," Miss Dubber corrected him severely as she hobbled towards the kitchen. "They took single rooms and in the evenings they watched football on the television. What was that you said, Mr. Canterbury?" </p><p> But Pym had not spoken. Sometimes his gushes of communication were like phone calls cut off by some inner censorship before they could be completed. He turned back a page and then another. </p><p> "I don't think I'll do casuals any more," Miss Dubber said through the open kitchen doorway as she lit the gas. "Sometimes when the doorbell goes I sit here with Toby and I say: 'You answer it, Toby.' He doesn't of course. A tortoiseshell cat can't answer a door. So we go on sitting here. We sit and we wait and we hear the footsteps go away again." She cast a sly glance at him. "You don't think our Mr. Canterbury is smitten, do you, Toby?" she enquired archly of her cat. "We're very <i>bright</i> this morning. Very <i>shiny.</i> Ten years younger, by the look of our coat, Mr. Canterbury is." Receiving no helpful response from the cat, she addressed herself to the canary. "Not that he'd ever tell us, would he, Dickie? We'd be the last to know. Tzuktzuk? Tzuktzuk?" </p><p> "John and Sylvia Illegible of Wimbledon," said Pym, still at the visitors' book. </p><p> "John makes computers, Sylvia programs them, and they're leaving tomorrow," she told him sulkily. For Miss Dubber hated to admit there was anyone in her world but beloved Mr. Canterbury. "Now what have you done to me this time?" she exclaimed angrily. "I won't have it. Take it back." </p><p> But Miss Dubber was not angry; she would have it, and Pym would not take it back: a thickly knitted cashmere shawl of white and gold, still in its Harrods box and swathed in its original Harrods tissue paper which she seemed to treasure almost above their contents. For having taken out the shawl she first smoothed the paper and folded it along its creases before replacing it in the box, then put the box on the cupboard shelf where she kept her greatest treasures. Only then did she let him wrap the shawl round her shoulders and hug her in it, while she scolded him for his extravagance. </p><p> Pym drank tea with Miss Dubber, Pym appeased her, Pym ate a piece of her shortbread and praised it to the skies although she told him it was burned. Pym promised to mend the sink plug for her and unblock the waste-pipe and take a look at the cistern on the first floor while he was about it. Pym was swift and over-attentive and the brightness she had shrewdly remarked on did not leave him. He lifted Toby on to his lap and stroked him, a thing he had never done before, and which gave Toby no discernible pleasure. He received the latest news of Miss Dubber's ancient Aunt Al, when normally the mention of Aunt Al was enough to hurry him off to bed. He questioned her, as he always did, about the local goings-on since his last visit, and listened approvingly to the catalogue of Miss Dubber's complaints. And quite often, as he nodded her through her answers, he either smiled to himself for no clear reason or became drowsy and yawned behind his hand. Till suddenly he put down his teacup and stood up as if he had another train to catch. </p><p> "I'll be staying a decent length of time if it's all right with you, Miss D. I've a bit of heavy writing to do." </p><p> "That's what you always say. You were going to live here for ever last time. Then it's up first thing and back to Whitehall without your egg." </p><p> "Maybe as much as two weeks. I've taken some leave of absence so that I can work in peace." </p><p> Miss Dubber pretended to be appalled. "But whatever will happen to the country? How shall Toby and I stay safe, with no Mr. Canterbury at the helm to steer us?" </p><p> "So what are Miss D's plans?" he asked winningly, reaching for his briefcase, which by the effort he needed to lift it looked as heavy as a chunk of lead. </p><p> "Plans?" Miss Dubber echoed, smiling rather beautifully in her mystification. "I don't make plans at my age, Mr. Canterbury. I let God make them. He's better at them than I am, isn't he, Toby? More reliable." </p><p> "What about that cruise you're always talking about? It's time you gave yourself a treat, Miss D." </p><p> "Don't be daft. That was years ago. I've lost the urge." </p><p> "I'll still pay." </p><p> "I know you will, bless you." </p><p> "I'll do the phoning if you want. We'll go to the travel agent together. I looked one out for you as a matter of fact. There's the <i>Orient Explorer</i> leaves Southampton just a week away. They've got a cancellation. I asked." </p><p> "Are you trying to get rid of me, Mr. Canterbury?" </p><p> Pym took a moment to laugh. "God and me together couldn't dislodge you, Miss D," he said. </p><p> From the hall Miss Dubber watched him up the narrow stairs, admiring the youthful springiness of his tread despite the heavy briefcase. He's going to a high-level conference. A weighty one too. She listened to him step lightly along the corridor to room 8 overlooking the square, which was her longest let ever, in her whole long life. His loss has not affected him, she decided in relief as she heard him unlock the door and close it softly behind him. Just some old colleague from the Ministry, no one close. She wanted nothing to disturb him. He was to remain the same perfect gentleman who had appeared on her doorstep years ago, looking for what he had called a sanctuary without a telephone even though she had a perfectly good one in the kitchen. And had paid her in advance six-monthly ever since, cash-cash, no receipts. And had built the little stone wall beside the garden path for her, all in an afternoon to surprise her on her birthday, bullied the mason and the bricklayer. And had put the slates back on the roof with his own hands after the storm in March. And had sent her flowers and fruit and chocolates and souvenirs from amazing foreign places without properly explaining what he did there. And had helped her with the breakfasts when she had too many casuals, and listened to her about her nephew who had all the schemes for making money that never came to anything: the latest was starting up a bingo hall in Exeter but first he needed the capital for his overdraft. And received no mail or visitors and played no instrument except the wireless in foreign, and never used the telephone except for local tradesmen. And never told her anything about himself except that he lived in London and worked in Whitehall but travelled a lot, and that his name was Canterbury like the city. Children, wives, parents, sweethearts -- not a soul on earth had he ever called his own, except his one Miss D. </p><p> "He could have a knighthood by now for all we know," she told Toby aloud as she held the shawl to her nose and inhaled its woolly smell. "He could be Prime Minister and we'd only ever hear it from the television." </p><p> Very faintly Miss Dubber heard above the rattle of the wind the sound of singing. A man's voice, tuneless but agreeable. First she thought it was "Greensleeves" from the garden, then she thought it was "Jerusalem" from the square, and she was halfway to the window to yell out. Only then did she realise it was Mr. Canterbury from upstairs, and this amazed her so much that when she opened her door to rebuke him, she paused instead to listen. The singing stopped of its own accord. Miss Dubber smiled. Now <i>he's</i> listening to <i>me,</i> she thought. That's my Mr. Canterbury all over. </p><p> <br> In Vienna three hours earlier, Mary Pym, wife of Magnus, stood at her bedroom window and stared out upon a world which, in contrast to the one elected by her husband, was a marvel of serenity. She had neither closed the curtains nor switched on the light. She was dressed to receive, as her mother would have said, and she had been standing at the window in her blue twin-set for an hour, waiting for the car, waiting for the doorbell, waiting for the soft turn of her husband's key in the latch. And now in her mind it was an unfair race between Magnus and Jack Brotherhood which of them she would receive first. An early autumn snow still covered the hilltop, a full moon rode above it, filling the room with black and white bars. In elegant villas up and down the avenue, the last camp fires of diplomatic entertainment were going out one by one. Frau Minister Meierhof had been having a Force Reduction Talks dance with a four-piece band. Mary should have been there. The van Leymans had had a buffet dinner for old Prague hands, both sexes welcome and no <i>placement.</i> She should have gone, they both should, and swept up the stragglers for a scotch-and-soda afterwards, vodka for Magnus. And put on the gramophone, and danced till now or later -- the swinging diplomatic Pyms, so popular -- just the way they had entertained so famously in Washington when Magnus was Deputy Head of Station and everything was absolutely fine. And Mary would have made bacon and eggs while Magnus joked and picked people's brains and acquired new friends, which he was so tirelessly good at. For this was Vienna's high season, when people who have clammed up all year talked excitedly of Christmas and the Opera, and tossed out indiscretions like old clothes. </p><p> But all that was a thousand years ago. All that was until last Wednesday. The only thing that mattered now was that Magnus should drive up the avenue in the Metro he had left at the airport and beat Jack Brotherhood to the front door. </p><p> The telephone was ringing. By the bed. His side. Don't run, you idiot, you'll fall. Not too slowly or he'll ring off. Magnus, darling, oh dear God, let it be you, you've had an aberration and you're better, I'll never even ask what happened, I'll never doubt you again. She lifted the receiver and for some reason she couldn't work out sat in a heap on the duvet, plonk, grabbing the pad and pencil with her spare hand in case of phone numbers to take down, addresses, times, instructions. She didn't blurt "Magnus?" because that would show she was worried about him. She didn't say "Hullo" because she couldn't trust her voice not to sound excited. She said their whole number in German so that Magnus would know it was she, hear that she was normal and all right and not angry with him, and that everything was just fine to come back to. No fuss, no problems, I'm here and waiting for you like always. </p><p> "It's me," said a man's voice. </p><p> But it wasn't me. It was Jack Brotherhood. </p><p> "No word of that parcel, I suppose?" Brotherhood asked in the rich, confident English of the military classes. </p><p> "No word from anyone. Where are you?" </p><p> "Be there in about half an hour, less if I can. Wait for me, will you." </p><p> The fire, she thought suddenly. My God, the fire. She hastened downstairs, no long...</p></p><h2>The Harley in the Barn: More Great Tales of Motorcycle Archaeology</h2><p><p><b>Break into that barn - you know you want to - there might be a vintage Harley inside.

Heinlein: In Dialogue with his Century: 1948-1988 The Man Who Learned Better</i>: The real-life story of Robert A. Heinlein in the second volume of the authorized biography by William H. Patterson!</p><p>Robert A. Heinlein (1907&#x2013;1988) is generally considered the greatest American science fiction writer of the twentieth century. His most famous and widely influential works include the Future History series (stories and novels collected in <i>The Past Through Tomorrow</i> and continued in later novels), <i>Starship Troopers</i>, <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, and <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i>&#x2015;all published in the years covered by this volume. He was a friend of admirals, bestselling writers, and artists; became committed to defending the United States during the Cold War; and was on the advisory committee that helped Ronald Reagan create the Star Wars Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s.</p><p>Heinlein was also devoted to space flight and humanity's future in space, and he was a commanding presence to all around him in his lifetime. Given his desire for privacy in the later decades of his life, the revelations in this biography make for riveting reading.</p></p><p>WILLIAM H. PATTERSON was a lifelong devotee of the works of Robert A. Heinlein, and was chosen by Virginia Heinlein to write Robert Heinlein&#39;s official biography. He died on April 22, 2014.<p>1</p> <p>HALF DONE, WELL BEGUN</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I cried at the altar, and Ginny cried when we got outside and, all in all, it was quite kosher.&#x201d;1</p> <p>October 21, 1948, was a beautiful, crisp fall day in Raton, New Mexico, just over the Colorado border. Snow gleamed on the distant mountaintops. Robert and Virginia Heinlein were finally married.</p> <p>They had settled in Colorado Springs until the divorce from Leslyn was finalized, and they both struggled through the tumult of deciding on this new commitment, discovering that they both wanted this new life together.</p> <p>Ginny, whose entire life had been spent in big cities, fell in love with that clean, mountain resort town,2 and they began putting down roots. Their social life had been somewhat constrained by the need to keep a low profile&#x2014;which is also why they went out of state for the wedding. Now, with the holidays coming on, in addition to working with a local radio station they joined a figure-skating club.3 Ginny, a national ice-skating semifinalist, was asked to star as a featured performer in the Broadmoor resort hotel&#x2019;s Christmas-week Symphony on Ice program&#x2014;an ice-dancing version of <i>The Nutcracker.</i></p> <p>Heinlein was sleeping well for the first time in years, his only health problem being a persistent sinusitis. Even his ex-wife Leslyn&#x2014;now a long-distance problem&#x2014;seemed to be straightening out after a very messy period of her life. Six months earlier, she had lost her job at Point Mugu&#x2014;&#x201c;compulsory resignation because of refusal to do work the way her boss wanted her to do it,&#x201d; their mutual friend Bill Corson wrote after talking with Buddy Scoles4&#x2014;&#x201c;complicated to unknown extent by liquor.&#x201d;5 And then she disappeared. Not even their lawyer&#x2014;Sam Kamens represented both Robert and Leslyn in the divorce action&#x2014;had heard from her in more than a year. By September, Heinlein learned from friends, Leslyn had turned up in a sanatarium in Long Beach, &#x201c;taking the cure.&#x201d; Her own letter to Robert had kindled hopes she would make a full recovery, since she had joined Alcoholics Anonymous.6</p> <p>Reconnecting with friends after his period of self-imposed isolation, Heinlein wrote long letters telling them about the marriage to Ginny, glossing over the timing. He had strict personal rules about telling the truth, always, but sometimes telling the truth selectively helped your friends maintain your privacy&#x2014;and other peoples&#x2019; illusions, if necessary.</p> <p>He had no illusions about getting back to work, especially now that he knew he could rely on Ginny as a helpmeet even with the writing, as Leslyn had been before the dark days (though in her own, different way). Heinlein was uncomfortably aware that the bank balance was dwindling away: Four months of unpaid labor on the screenplay for <i>Destination Moon</i> in the spring and summer of 1948 had put a severe crimp in their finances. He <i>would not</i> let Ginny go back to work. Heinlein&#x2019;s Navy pension and a small but steady trickle of reprint requests for his prewar stories almost covered current expenses. The script could potentially put them in the clear. George Pal was shopping the project around Hollywood (though without getting even a nibble of interest).</p> <p>In the fall of 1948, Heinlein had three books in print: his second juvenile for Scribner, <i>Space Cadet,</i> came out in August&#x2014;and the first, <i>Rocket Ship Galileo,</i> was still selling briskly. Fantasy Press issued the revised <i>Beyond This Horizon</i>. In five or six months they would have royalty payments that would cover next year&#x2019;s taxes and living expenses; he could feel reasonably confident that he wouldn&#x2019;t dip back into poverty, as they had in Fort Worth at Christmastime a year earlier. Gnome Press, another of the new, small specialty publishing houses, wanted to publish <i>Sixth Column</i> under the Heinlein name instead of the Anson MacDonald pseudonym it had borne when published in <i>Astounding Science-Fiction.</i> John Campbell, Heinlein thought, ought at least to have a coauthor credit, since it had been written from Campbell&#x2019;s (verbal) outline. He wrote to Campbell, and to Lurton Blassingame, asking what sort of fee and credit split would be appropriate. But Campbell did not want either money or credit.7</p> <p>In the meantime, other speculative ventures were falling into his lap&#x2014;two in one week recently: an offer to do continuity for a science-fiction newspaper comic strip8 and a request from the A&amp;S Lyons Hollywood agency to develop a science-fiction radio show, with him as the host.9 Heinlein asked his cowriter of the <i>Destination Moon</i> script, Alford &#x201c;Rip&#x201d; van Ronkel, about the agency&#x2019;s reputation. It was a genuine offer, van Ronkel told him.10 Heinlein was skeptical: He knew he had a good &#x201c;radio voice&#x201d;&#x2014;better on radio than it sounded naturally&#x2014;but felt he was not &#x201c;celebrity&#x201d; enough to carry such a show (though if they wanted to pay him&#x2014;a thousand dollars a week was about right&#x2014;he would put his objections aside).11</p> <p>The regular writing was moving along: After thinking about it for a while, Heinlein had come up with a good idea for the scouting story that <i>Boys&#x2019; Life</i> had been asking for. He originally intended &#x201c;Nothing Ever Happens on the Moon&#x201d; as a short story12 about the first interplanetary Triple Eagle Scout, though it grew uncontrollably in the telling; by early November he had written twenty-five thousand words and struggled through multiple drafts with colored pencils, to cut it to nine thousand words. This produced a manuscript that looked, he said, like &#x201c;modernist wallpaper.&#x201d;13</p> <p>His professional life was flourishing, just as the demands of his personal life escalated: When Ginny was in Washington, D.C., during the war, she had been diagnosed with thyroid deficiency. In the fall of 1948 her medications were adjusted, and Robert was helping her keep to her medication schedule. &#x201c;She takes a grain and a half a day and is repulsively energetic, unless she happens to forget to take her pills. I have posted a chart and award her gold stars for taking her pills.&#x201d;14 Nobody else would recognize and validate that small-girl part of her personality&#x2014;but Heinlein had quite a lot of small boy in his own makeup, which he rarely showed to anyone but her.</p> <p>As she regained her full energy, Ginny took on the task of getting Robert&#x2019;s health in order. He had been sick the entire time she had known him, and when he was in Los Angeles working on the script for <i>Destination Moon,</i> his right leg began to bother him. Dr. King, the Los Angeles orthopedist he saw, had him doing stretching and strengthening exercises with orthopedic devices, to improve a postural imbalance he had picked up from fencing.15 As their financial crisis eased, Ginny devoted more time and resources to the housekeeping and meal budget, stretching her talent and skills to make his meals sophisticated, flavorful, and sustaining. Robert had grown up on the heavy and undistinguished cooking of the Midwest: Vegetables that were not boiled to a limp mess and beefsteak rare and <i>� point</i>&#x2014;not gray and overdone and tough&#x2014;were new to him.16</p> <p>But her program was derailed almost before it began. The doctor Heinlein was consulting about his sinusitis tested him for allergies. He tested positive for&#x2014;well, nearly everything: &#x201c;Seems I&#x2019;m allergic to milk (ice cream, cheese, cream soups), corn (but not corn liquor), and lettuce. Why lettuce? Why not spinach? Ginny is beside herself trying to figure out how to feed me.&#x201d;17 Heinlein took it in stride: &#x201c;Me, I don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;anything is worthwhile to get the full use of my schnozzle again&#x2014;and a little dieting will help my waist line. Ginny is such a swell cook that I have a strong disposition to over-eat.&#x201d;18</p> <p>As they settled into their new life together, they began to take up their political interests, as well. They had moved to Colorado Springs too late in the year to register to vote: For the first time in Ginny&#x2019;s adult life, she would not be able to vote in a presidential election (Robert had filed an absentee ballot in California).19 There was a good chance that President Truman might lose to Republican Tom Dewey (neither Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond nor Henry Wallace&#x2019;s Progressive Party stood any real chance in this election&#x2014;but they both weakened Truman&#x2019;s support).</p> <p>Robert had come to respect Truman&#x2019;s strength of character&#x2014;particularly after his handling of the Democratic Party&#x2019;s racism at the nominating convention that summer:</p> <p>What I do like is the fact that Truman stood up to the southern &#x201c;gentlemen&#x201d; white racists and told them to go pee up a rope, and most especially the fact that the convention backed him up on it. If the convention had pussyfooted on civil rights I would have been strongly tempted to vote the vegetarian ticket. But it didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;&#x2026; this was a time to stand up and be counted, and the count came out on the side of human decency, which made me happy and proud.20</p> <p>Ginny was less enthusiastic about Truman.21</p> <p>On election night, Robert stationed himself by the radio and stayed awake, tallying the overnight results as they came in. In the morning, he told her with great satisfaction that Truman had won&#x2014;much in advance of the official count.</p> <p>With the elections out of the way, Heinlein returned to the problem of his annual boys&#x2019; book for Scribner. He had intended to build a story around undersea agriculture&#x2014;a family of sea-farmers, since his editor, Alice Dalgliesh, wanted a prominent girl character this time. She had found his outline notes for <i>Ocean Rancher</i> &#x201c;thrilling&#x201d;22&#x2014;but he needed to get in more suit-diving to finish off his background research. Ginny put her foot down: She had almost lost him last year.23 <i>Ocean Rancher</i> was out.</p> <p>Heinlein always had a hard time coming up with ideas for these boys&#x2019; books. He had to invent something adventurous that boys would be interested in, without needing excessive background explanations. And it was always a problem to get the boys out from under the thumbs of their adult &#x201c;protectors,&#x201d; because adventures were what they were being protected <i>from</i>.24 Targeted at a general readership, these boys&#x2019; books could not use the genre conventions of the science-fiction magazines&#x2014;but he could use ordinary science.</p> <p>His approach to the science-fiction juvenile was evolving. When he wrote <i>Rocket Ship Galileo</i> in 1946, the form of the juvenile was dominated by the Tom Swift/Motor Boys formula. <i>Space Cadet,</i> in 1948, was built around a group of teenagers, and so is still fairly close to the formula. His third book, however, would depart further.</p> <p>His core idea came out of a story he remembered that Jack Williamson had cowritten with Miles J. Breuer in 1930, &#x201c;The Birth of a New Republic&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;A very, very solid piece of work, one of my favorites, and miles ahead of the stuff&nbsp;&#x2026; of the period.&#x201d;25 A story began coming together in his mind, about a revolution on Mars against a distant Earth colonial authority. He wrote up a synopsis of the story as an outline-proposal and sent it to Alice Dalgliesh, by way of Lurton Blassingame.26</p> <p>That November he wrote a story of a woman on a space station overcoming male chauvinism, &#x201c;Delilah and the Space Rigger,&#x201d; aimed at <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> (which found it too &#x201c;technical&#x201d;). Ginny suggested another story idea to work on while &#x201c;Delilah&#x201d; started on the rounds of other slicks:27 In <i>Space Cadet</i> he had mentioned several iconic heroes-of-the-Space-Patrol. She suggested he write the story of Dahlquist, who stopped a military coup at the cost of his own life. During the first two weeks of December 1948, this turned into &#x201c;The Long Watch&#x201d;&#x2014;a &#x201c;downbeat&#x201d; story, since the hero dies at the end, but it showed what had inspired those boys about the story: &#x201c;The narrator is a hero in the mold that Heinlein perfected,&#x201d; Andre Norton later wrote of this story. &#x201c;That is, he&#x2019;s an ordinary guy who must decide to do the extraordinary because of his belief in the American system of government.&#x201d;28 Ginny cried when she typed it for submission&#x2014;and every time she had to retype it.29 Eventually, she said, her tears rusted out her typewriter.30</p> <p>Heinlein had another writing chore he had been putting off since August: He wanted to do a really good story for John Campbell, as a major &#x201c;thank-you&#x201d; for his efforts to get Street &amp; Smith to change its policy of buying and reserving &#x201c;all rights.&#x201d;31 Now they bought and reserved only serial and paperback rights, and this allowed Campbell to meet the conditions Heinlein set out two years earlier&#x2014;rates respectable for pulp, if not as good as the slicks. All he needed was a good idea.</p> <p>That, of course, is the hard part. Campbell suggested a dodge that would let them talk it over &#x201c;in person&#x201d;: He had become interested in ham radio and threw himself into it with enthusiasm. There were a couple of hams in Colorado Springs, and Campbell arranged with one of them, Bill Talmaine, to make a connection on Friday, December 3, 1948.32</p> <p><i>Astounding</i>&#x2019;s November 1948 issue had come out the same week Heinlein remarried. In it, Campbell printed a &#x201c;joke&#x201d; letter from Richard Hoen&#x2014;a &#x201c;review&#x201d; of the November 1949 issue, a year in the future. It was to be a glorious reunion of all the prewar greats, and Hoen had mentioned a new serial by Heinlein (as &#x201c;R. A. MacH&#x201d;, referring to Heinlein&#x2019;s &#x201c;Anson MacDonald&#x201d; pen name), giving only the title &#x201c;Gulf,&#x201d; and no other details (except that he implied it was not part of the Future History). It was a good joke, Heinlein told Campbell&#x2014;and pointed out that he could top it: If Campbell would talk the other writers into doing stories with the titles Hoen had given, Heinlein could write something for the &#x201c;Gulf&#x201d; title and make Hoen&#x2019;s &#x201c;prediction&#x201d; come true.33</p> <p>At that stage Heinlein did not have any specific idea for the story&#x2014;he might be able to use some of the <i>Ocean Rancher</i> material, so the title could refer to the Gulf of Mexico, or&#x2014;he kept turning the notion over in his mind but was getting nowhere.34 He asked Ginny for a story conference. They scheduled a formal meeting, and he asked her to come with a few story ideas they could toss around.35</p> <p>Ginny&#x2019;s help with the business side of the writing had already expanded well beyond that of a well-trained secretary. Much of her impact on him she could not really be aware of: Her &#x201c;presence&#x201d; was simply everywhere in his life, in big ways and little. The most casual remarks from her might spark a story idea, but she didn&#x2019;t even need to talk to inspire a story. One day, when she was putting away the wire recorder (since they were no longer using it for dictation) it <i>squawked,</i> and that gave Heinlein an idea for Willis, one of his Martian characters in <i>Red Planet&#x2014;</i>that it would repeat sounds back at you, like a living wire recorder.36 And the rest of his book&#x2019;s Martian biology built itself around that and integrated into the boy-hero&#x2019;s resistance to an attempted dictatorship on the Martian Colony. Ginny later commented, &#x201c;Robert asked me to make notes when I had story ideas, and I always did. Sometimes they were simply notions for small things, other times they were bigger&#x2026;&#x201d;37</p> <p>For this first story conference, Ginny&#x2019;s best idea was a variation on Kipling&#x2019;s Jungle Books stories&#x2014;a human Mowgli raised, not by animals, but by aliens and then returned to Earth. It would be a satire, she explained. The boy would be like those goslings that imprinted on duck mothers, and the story built around his figuring out how to be a human being. Heinlein remembers the moment as linked to <i>Red Planet,</i> which he was researching and planning at that time:</p> <p>Time after time ideas would beget more ideas, and I would have to lay the second generation regretfully away with the thought that the discarded notion was a little too involved and a bit too strong med...</p></p><h2>Raintree: Inferno (Raintree, 1)</h2><p>Two hundred years after the Raintree clan defeated and<br>abandoned them on a small Caribbean Island, the Ansara<br>wizards are rising again to take on their bitterest foes.<br>Despite their extraordinary powers and supernatural origin,<br>the Raintree have largely blended into the modern world.<br>They are bankers, cops, husbands, wives and lovers in the<br>society of humankind.

The image was in black and white, to better show details; color distracted the brain. He focused on her hands, watching every move she made, but what struck him most was how uncommonly <i>still</i> she was. She didn't fidget, or play with her chips, or look around at the other players. She peeked once at her down card, then didn't touch it again, signaling for another hit by tapping a fingernail on the table. Just because she didn't seem to be paying attention to the other players, though, didn't mean she was as unaware as she seemed.<p> </p><p>"What's her name?" he asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Lorna Clay," replied his chief of security, Al Rayburn.</p><p> </p><p>"Is that her real name?"</p><p> </p><p>"It checks out."</p><p> </p><p>If Al hadn't already investigated her, Dante would have been disappointed. He paid Al a lot of money to be efficient and thorough.</p><p> </p><p>"At first I thought she was counting," said Al.</p><p> </p><p>"But she doesn't pay enough attention."</p><p> </p><p>"She's paying attention, all right," Dante murmured. "You just don't see her doing it." A card counter had to remember every card played. Supposedly counting cards was impossible with the number of decks used by the casinos, but no casino wanted a card counter at its tables. There <i>were </i>those rare individuals who could calculate the odds even with multiple decks.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought that, too," said Al. "But look at this piece of tape coming up. Someone she knows comes up to her and speaks, she looks around and starts chatting, completely misses the play of the people to her left&#x2014;and doesn't look around even when the deal comes back to her, she just taps that finger. And damned if she didn't win. Again."</p><p> </p><p>Dante watched the tape, rewound it, watched it again. Then he watched it a third time. There had to be something he was missing, because he couldn't pick out a single giveaway.</p><p> </p><p>"If she's cheating," Al said with something like respect, "she's the best I've ever seen."</p><p> </p><p>"What does your gut say?" Dante trusted his chief of security. Al had spent thirty years in the casino business, and some people swore he could spot cheats as soon as they walked in the door. If Al thought she was cheating, then Dante would take action&#x2014;and he wouldn't be watching this tape now if something hadn't made Al uneasy.</p><p> </p><p>Al scratched the side of his jaw, considering. He was a big, bulky man, but no one who observed him for any length of time would think he was slow, either physically or mentally. Finally he said, "If she isn't cheating, she's the luckiest person walking. She wins. Week in, week out, she wins. Never a huge amount, but I ran the numbers, and she's into us for about five grand a week. Hell, boss, on her way out of the casino she'll stop by a slot machine, feed a dollar in and walk away with at least fifty. It's never the same machine, either. I've had her watched, I've had her followed, I've even looked for the same faces in the casino every time she's in here, and I can't find a common denominator."</p><p> </p><p>"Is she here now?" "She came in about half an hour ago. She's playing blackjack, as usual."</p><p> </p><p>"Who's the dealer?"</p><p> </p><p>"Cindy."</p><p> </p><p>Cindy Josephson was Dante's best dealer, almost as sharp at spotting a cheater as Al himself. She had been with him since he'd opened Inferno, and he trusted her to run an honest game. "Bring the woman to my office," Dante said, making a swift decision. "Don't make a scene."</p><p> </p><p>"Got it," said Al, turning on his heel and leaving the security center, where banks of monitors displayed every angle of the casino.</p><p> </p><p>Dante left, too, going up to his office. His face was calm. Normally he would leave it to Al to deal with a cheater, but he was curious. How was she doing it? There were a lot of bad cheaters, a few good ones, and every so often one would come along who was the stuff of which legends were made: the cheater who didn't get caught, even when people were alert and the camera was on him&#x2014;or, in this case, her.</p><p> </p><p>It was possible for people to simply be lucky, as most people understood luck. Chance could turn a habitual loser into a big-time winner. Casinos, in fact, thrived on that hope. But luck itself wasn't habitual, and he knew that what passed for luck was often something else: cheating. Then there was the other kind of luck, the kind he himself possessed, but since it depended not on chance but on who and what he was, he knew it was an innate power and not Dame Fortune's erratic smiles. Since his power was rare, the odds made it likely the woman he'd been watching was merely a very clever cheat.</p><p> </p><p>Her skill could provide her with a very good living, he thought, doing some swift calculations in his head. Five grand a week equaled two hundred sixty thousand dollars a year, and that was just from his casino. She probably hit all of them, careful to keep the numbers relatively low so she stayed under the radar.</p><p> </p><p>He wondered how long she'd been taking him, how long she'd been winning a little here, a little there, before Al noticed.</p><p> </p><p>The curtains were still open on the wall-to-wall window in his office, giving the impression, when one first opened the door, of stepping out onto a covered balcony. The glazed window faced west, so he could catch the sunsets. The sun was low now, the sky painted in purple and gold. At his home in the mountains, most of the windows faced east, affording him views of the sunrise. Something in him needed both the greeting and the goodbye of the sun. He'd always been drawn to sunlight, maybe because fire was his element to call, to control.</p><p> </p><p>He checked his internal time: four minutes until sundown. He knew exactly, without checking the tables every day, when the sun would slide behind the mountains. He didn't own an alarm clock. He didn't need one. He was so acutely attuned to the sun's position that he had only to check within himself to know the time. As for waking at a particular time, he was one of those people who could tell himself to wake at a certain time, and he did. That particular talent had nothing to do with being Raintree, so he didn't have to hide it; a lot of perfectly ordinary people had the same ability.</p><p> </p><p>There were other talents and abilities, however, that did require careful shielding. The long days of summer instilled in him an almost sexual high, when he could feel contained power buzzing just beneath his skin. He had to be doubly careful not to cause candles to leap into flame just by his presence, or to start wildfires, with a glance, in the dry-as-tinder brush. He loved Reno; he didn't want to burn it down. He just felt so damn<i> alive</i> with all the sunshine pouring down that he wanted to let the energy pour through him instead of holding it inside.</p><p> </p><p>This must be how his brother Gideon felt while pulling lightning, all that hot power searing through his muscles, his veins. They had this in common, the connection with raw power. All the members of the far-flung Raintree clan had some power, some heightened form of ability, but only members of the royal family could channel and control the earth's natural energies.</p><p> </p><p>Dante wasn't just of the royal family; he was the Dranir, the leader of the entire clan. "Dranir" was synonymous with "king," but the position he held wasn't ceremonial, it was one of sheer power. He was the oldest son of the previous Dranir, but he would have been passed over for the position if he hadn't also inherited the power to hold it.</p><p> </p><p>Gideon was second to him in power; if anything happened to Dante and he died without a child who had inherited his abilities, Gideon would become Dranir&#x2014;a possibility that filled his brother with dread, hence the fertility charm currently lying on Dante's desk. It had arrived in the mail just that morning. Gideon regularly sent them, partly as a joke, but mainly because he was doing all he could to insure that Dante had offspring&#x2014;thus upping the chances that <i>he</i> would never inherit the position. Whenever they managed to get together, Dante had to carefully search every nook and cranny, as well as all his clothing, to make certain Gideon hadn't left one of his clever little charms in a hidden place.</p><p> </p><p>Gideon was getting better at making them, Dante mused. Practice made perfect, after all, and God knows he'd made plenty of the charms in the past few years. Not only were they more potent now, but he varied his approach. Some of them were obvious, silver pieces meant to be worn around the neck like an amulet&#x2014;not that Dante was an amulet kind of guy. Others were tiny, subtle, like the one Gideon had embedded in the newest business card he'd sent, knowing Dante would likely tuck the card into his pocket. He'd erred only in that the very power of the charm gave it away; Dante had sensed the buzz of its power, though he'd had the devil's own time finding it.</p><p> </p><p>Behind him came Al's distinctive<i> knock-knock</i> on the door. The outer office was empty, Dante's secretary having gone home hours before. "Come in," he called, not turning from his view of the sunset.</p><p> </p><p>The door opened, and Al said, "Mr. Raintree, this is Lorna Clay."</p><p> </p><p>Dante turned and looked at the woman, all his senses on alert. The first thing he noticed was the vibrant color of her hair&#x2014;a rich, dark red that encompassed a multitude of shades from copper to burgundy. The warm amber light danced along the iridescent strands, and he felt a hard tug of sheer lust in his gut. Looking at her hair was almost like looking at fire, and he had the same reaction.</p><p> </p><p>The second thing he noticed was that she was spitting mad.</p><p></p></p><h2>Armies of the Napoleonic Wars: An illustrated history (General Military)</h2><p>The Napoleonic Wars saw almost two decades of brutal fighting, from the frozen wastelands of Russia to the wildness of the Peninsula; from Egypt&#39;s Lower Nile to the bloody battlefield of Waterloo.

Born on her grandfather Don Felipe's coffee plantation at Catemaco in 1898, Laura knows both the privilege of wealth and its limitations. Her parents, Leticia and Fernando, live apart, prudently waiting until Fernando can support his family in the larger town of Veracruz. While Don Felipe fights the laurel branches that continually weave their way through his delicate coffee plants, Laura watches as her gifted unmarried aunts are consumed by the forced idleness of their kind: Hilda, who plays Chopin to empty rooms, and Virginia, whose love poems never reach a suitor.<p> In Veracruz, Laura will find a focus for her own youthful longing, her half-brother Santiago, whose clandestine aid to the anarchist-syndicalists leads to his execution. After his death, she is expected to follow the girlish ambitions of her friends: taking dancing lessons and learning to listen to men. Yet in honor of her half-brother's memory, she embraces the revolution, and, hoping to avoid the fate of her virgin aunts, marries a solemn, dark-skinned, working-class hero. "The active life was preferable," Laura concludes at the ripe age of 22. For a woman, inevitably, this means "a life committed to another life." </p><p> A daughter, a wife, and then a mother, Laura is more or less dragged along by history. Eventually she must sacrifice not only Santiago but her own son and grandson to the violent game of musical chairs that is Mexican political life. Perhaps because of the almost laughable instability of power in Mexico, Fuentes is compelled to devote much of his narrative energy to explaining the rapid changes of guard--presidential assassinations succeeded by coups followed by questionable elections.</p><p> The poor and downtrodden, by contrast, are always there. Laura's husband takes her to the barrios of Mexico City to dissuade her from assuming anything but a housewife's role in political affairs. Later, a lover leads her through a nocturnal wasteland, a city of the poor, showing her deformed beggars, and stunted, starving children: </p><blockquote>Laura, did your husband show you this, or did he only show you the pretty side of poverty, the workers with their cheap shirts, the whores with their powder, the organ grinders and locksmiths, the tamale sellers and the saddlers? Is that his working class? Do you want to rebel against your husband? Hate him because he didn't give you a chance to do something for others, treated you with contempt? </blockquote> Laura decides that although she can't save everyone, she can save herself through work. And the first work she undertakes--wonderfully and bizarrely--is as a traveling companion to Frida Kahlo.<p> Given the time span and the gravity of occurrences this epic covers, it is no surprise that this character herself often seems to stand still while events and people move around her. Because of this, perhaps, <i>The Years with Laura D�az</i> is not the clearest articulation of Fuentes's historical vision, nor his most moving work. Its emotional power is cumulative, however, and few readers will be able to put the novel down after the first hundred pages. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Published in hardcover by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2000, 0-374-29341-4<br></p><h2>Hunters in the Trees: a Natural History of Arboreal Snakes</h2><p>Hunters in the Trees: A Natural History of Arboreal Snakes is a readable up-to-the-minute compendium of what we know about tree snakes written in a clear, nontechnical style for an adult audience of nature lovers and reptile afficionados. The book is worldwide in scope, discussing the diversity of arboreal snakes and their biology. How does one hide when the enemy may lurk above, beside or below? What sorts of display tactics might serve best for defense and how do they differ from those used by ground dwelling snakes? How does life in the trees affect vision? What kinds of temperature and moisture conditions must an arboreal snake contend with? How do acrobatics affect blood pressure? How does one find a mate in the canopy? What happens if a snake falls? With questions like these, Sajdak takes us into a realm as broad as all of herpetology. From the foreword by William W.

In <i>Schnibbles Times Two</i>, Carrie Nelson has included loads of fantastic quilt patterns that use these fun and time-saving precuts. Each pattern is shown using 10" squares and 5" squares. Not only does that make for two different size options, but it means that quilters get to see each pattern in two different color combinations--something that is always very helpful for me when choosing a project. I'm excited to get started with the Stacks and Charms I've collected in my stash--now I just have to decide on which pattern! --connectingthreads.com<br><br>Charm packs and layer cakes are the focus of this book . . . Carrie explains how they are best used, how many to buy, those pinked edges, and the warp. There are 12 patterns, each of them done in 5" squares and 10" squares. The book features lots of clever ideas for pretty and colorful quilts. I'm still not sold on these packs, but love the book. I think I'll cut my squares from my stash! --Stick Your Nose in a Book: Quilting Book Reviews by Jennifer Zoeterman</p><h2>Dictionary of Cliches</h2><p>"The best kind of reference book--one that amuses as it instructs.

Rewind. Stop. Play. Rewind frame by frame. Stop. Play frame by frame.</p><p>Stephen Jay Gould, one of the best-known evolutionary biologists of his time, wrote in <i>Wonderful Life</i>, his book on the weird and wonderful fossils of a rock formation known as the Burgess Shale, that you can&#x2019;t go home again, evolutionarily, unless you want to risk not being here when you come back. What he was saying was that evolution is a chance business, contingent on many influences and events. You can&#x2019;t rewind it and run it over and hope to get the same result. The second time through <i>Homo sapiens</i> might not appear. Primates might not appear.</p><p>That&#x2019;s evolution on a grand scale, major trends in the history of life that involved mass extinctions and numerous species jockeying for evolutionary position. We can&#x2019;t rewind that tape without a planet to toy with. But I&#x2019;m thinking about a time machine with a somewhat closer focus, an evolutionary microscope that could target, say, the first appearance of feathers on dinosaurs, or the evolution of dinosaurs into birds.</p><p>This time machine/microscope could zero in on one body part. For birds we might start small, with a much maligned body part&#x2014;the tail. We don&#x2019;t think about tails much, not at the high levels of modern evolutionary biology, but they are more intriguing than you might imagine. They appear and disappear in evolution. They appear and disappear in the growth of a tadpole. Most primates have tails. Humans and great apes are exceptions.</p><p>The dinosaurs had tails, some quite remarkable. Birds, the descendants of dinosaurs, now almost universally described by scientists as avian dinosaurs, do not have tails. They have tail feathers but not an extended muscular tail complete with vertebrae and nerves. Some of the first birds had long tails, and some later birds had short tails. But there is no modern bird with a tail.</p><p>How did that change occur? Is there a way to re-create that evolutionary change and see how it happened, right down to the molecules involved in directing, or stopping, tail growth?</p><p>I think the answer is yes. I think we can rewind the tape of bird evolution to the point before feathers or a tail emerged, or teeth disappeared. Then we can watch it run forward, and then rewind again, and try to play it without the evolutionary change, reverting to the original process. I&#x2019;m not suggesting we can do this on a grand scale, but we can pick a species, study its growth as an embryo, learn how it develops, and learn how to change that development.</p><p>Then we can experiment with individual embryos, intervening in development in different ways&#x2014;with no change, with one change, or several changes. This would be a bit like redoing Game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and the Boston Red Sox, when a ground ball ran between first baseman Bill Buckner&#x2019;s legs and changed the tide of the series.</p><p>We would be doing more than just fiddling with the tape; we would be redoing the play, with Bill Buckner and all the players. And the idea would be to determine the precise cause of the Mets&#x2019; joy and Red Sox&#x2019; sadness. Was it Buckner&#x2019;s failing legs, the speed of the ball, the topography of the field? What caused him to miss the ball? And when we think we know the cause, we test our hypothesis. We give him younger legs or smooth out the field and then we see if in this altered set of circumstances, he snags the grounder.</p><p>That&#x2019;s impossible to do in baseball. We don&#x2019;t have a way to go back in time. We can do it with computer models, of course, in both baseball and biology. But with current technology and our current understanding of development and evolution, we could also do it with a living organism. This ability is largely the result of a new and thriving field of research that has joined together the study of how an embryo develops with the study of how evolution occurs. The idea, in simple terms, is that because the shape or form of an animal emerges as it grows from a fertilized egg to hatching or birth, any evolutionary change in that shape must be reflected in a change in the way the embryo grows.</p><p>For example, in a long-tailed ancient bird embryo the tail would have started to develop and continued to develop until the chick hatched with a full tail. The embryos of descendant species, which hatched with no tails, would have to develop in a different way. We can observe the embryos of modern birds as they develop, and if we can pinpoint the moment at which the tail stops growing, we can figure out exactly what events occurred at the molecular level to stop tail growth. We can say&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where the change occurred in evolution. And it is an idea we can test. We can try intervening at that moment in the embryo&#x2019;s growth to change the growth and development signals back to what we believe they were before the tail disappeared in evolution. If we are right, then the long tail should grow. If we can do this with a tail, we ought to be able to do it with teeth, feathers, wings, and feet.</p><p>The most studied and most available bird for both laboratory and culinary experiments is the chicken. Why couldn&#x2019;t we take a chicken embryo and biochemically nudge it this way and that, until what hatched was not a chicken but a small dinosaur, with teeth, forearms with claws, and a tail? No reason at all.</p><p>We haven&#x2019;t done it yet. But we are taking the first small steps. This book is about those steps, the path ahead, what we could learn, and why we should do this experiment.</p><p>Hatching a dinosaur from a chicken&#x2019;s egg may sound like something that belongs in a movie. It seems very remote from my specialty, vertebrate paleontology, in particular the study of dinosaurs. Paleontologists, after all, are the slightly eccentric folks who dig up old bones in sun-drenched badlands and like to talk too much about skulls and femurs. Well, that may be true, as far as it goes. But that&#x2019;s only part of the story. At heart, every paleontologist is as much Frank Buck as Stephen Jay Gould.</p><p>Frank Buck was a real person who became a hero of movies and books before and after World War II. He went into the jungles and remote places of the world and brought back not fossils, but exotic living animals. He was&#x2014;and this appealed to many a small boy&#x2014;not a hunter who killed his prey, but a collector of live animals. And his motto, once as well known as any of today&#x2019;s catchphrases, was: Bring &#x2019;em back alive.</p><p>Well, paleontologists may deal with the long dead. But at the heart of all the digging and preparation of skeletons and museum displays is the attempt to reconstruct the past, to re-create moments in the history of life. What we would really love to do, if we could, is bring &#x2019;em back alive.</p></p><h2>Coaching Classroom Management Strategies and Tools for Administrators and Coaches</h2><p>Coaching Classroom Management is the perfect companion to CHAMPs, Discipline in the Secondary Classroom, or any research-based approach to managing student behavior.

Author and photographer Ethan Russell was one of only sixteen people--including the Rolling Stones--who made up the 1969 tour. He was with them in their hotel rooms, at rehearsals, and on stage. He tells the story of this monumental and historic tour firsthand, including recollections from band members, crew, security, and other sixties icons--like Abbie Hoffman and Little Richard--they met along the way. And he also includes amazing photos of the performers who toured with the Stones that year: the legendary Tina Turner and B. B. King. <br><br>Through vivid quotes taken from his interviews with the band and crew, and through more than 220 revealing photographs, Russell takes you behind the scenes for an uncensored look inside the Rolling Stones' world at the end of the sixties. It was an idealistic time, with an overarching belief that music could bring us all together. But the events that led to the terrible violence and stabbing death at Altamont would change rock and roll forever.</p><p>Ethan Russell is a multi-Grammy nominated photographer and director. He is the only photographer to have shot album covers of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Who. Ethan produced music videos with Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, kd lang, Rosanne Cash, Hank Williams, Jr. and Randy Travis, among others. He is also an award winning creative director and the author of <i>Dear Mr. Fantasy</i> (Houghton Mifflin 1985).</p><h2>My Italian Kitchen: Favorite Family Recipes from the Winner of MasterChef Season 4 on FOX</h2><p><b>WELCOME TO MY ITALIAN KITCHEN AND MY BIGGEST PASSION: FOOD.</b><br>Most of my family memories revolve around food, especially family holidays, and everyone knows how important food and wine are in Italian culture.

Sontag's incisive intelligence, expressive brilliance, and deep curiosity about art, politics, and the writer's responsibility to bear witness have secured her place as one of the most important thinkers and writers of the twentieth century. <i>At the Same Time </i>gathers sixteen essays and addresses written in the last years of Sontag's life, when her work was being honored on the international stage, that reflect on the personally liberating nature of literature, her deepest commitment, and on political activism and resistance to injustice as an ethical duty. She considers the works of writers from the little-known Soviet novelist Leonid Tsypkin, who struggled and eventually succeeded in publishing his only book days before his death; to the greats, such as Nadine Gordimer, who enlarge our capacity for moral judgment. Sontag also fearlessly addresses the dilemmas of post-9/11 America, from the degradation of our political rhetoric to the appalling torture of prisoners in Abu Ghraib.</p><p><i>At the Same Time</i>, which includes a foreword by her son, David Rieff, is a passionate, compelling work from an American writer at the height of her powers, who always saw literature "as a passport to enter a larger life, the zone of freedom."</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Sontag </b>was the author of four novels, including <i>In America</i>, which won the 2000 National Book Award for Fiction; a collection of stories; several plays; and seven works of nonfiction. She died in New York City on December 28, 2004.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Literature and politics are inextricably intertwined and unified by moral purpose in this powerful collection of pieces (a couple not previously published in English or at all) by iconic critic and novelist Sontag (<i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i>), who died in 2004. Sontag was a dedicated champion of literature in translation, and the book opens with several introductions to such works, led off by a meditation on beauty. The section might have been called "Art and Ardor," so laced is it with artistic passion, both Sontag's own and that of the writers she celebrates, such as Leonid Tsypkin and Anna Banti. Part three contains speeches Sontag gave in accepting the Jerusalem Prize and other awards, and honoring others whose moral courage she admired. But most striking is to re-read the pieces she wrote in the wake of 9/11 and the Abu Ghraib scandal, which constitute the book's middle section. Sontag's controversial attack on the Bush administration immediately after 9/11 may have been an act of courage or of folly, but from a distance of five years, her critique seems on the mark. Sontag's brilliance as a literary critic, her keen analytical skill and her genius for the searingly apt phrase (like her damning "the photographs <i>are</i> us" in relation to the Abu Ghraib photos) are all fiercely displayed here. <i>(Mar. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Heretics G. K. Chesterton unmasks the heresies of contemporary thinking by exposing the faulty thinking of popular notions, especially apparent in the arts. An often overlooked book that contains some of Chesterton&#x2019;s strongest writing, the author takes on the &#x201c;heresies&#x201d; of modern thought, such as negativism, relativism, neo-paganism, puritanism, aestheticism, and individualism. The book includes one of his best essays: &#x201c;On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of Family.&#x201d;<br><br>This 1905 collection of articles focuses on the era&#x2019;s &#x201c;heretics&#x201d;: those who pride themselves on their superiority to conservative views. Chesterton&#x2019;s companion volume to Orthodoxy asseses such artists and writers as Kipling, Shaw, Wells, and Whistler with the author&#x2019;s characteristic wisdom and good humor.<br><br>Chesterton was one of the spiritual influences on C. S. Lewis. Readers who appreciate the writings of Lewis will want to explore the writings of those who influenced him, including Chesterton. Heretics is now available from Hendrickson in a re-typeset and redesigned version as a welcome addition to the successful Christian Classics series.<br><br>Hendrickson Christian Classics<br>Every Christian library needs the classics&#x2014;the timeless books that have spoken powerfully to generations of believers.

Attractive, classically bound covers look great together on the shelf. Best of all, value pricing makes this series easy to own. Planned to span the spectrum of Christian wisdom through the ages, Hendrickson Christian Classics set a new standard for quality and value.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><p><b>G. K. Chesterton</b> (1874&#x2013;1936) was one of C. S. Lewis&#x2019; primary mentors in apologetics, and an influence even in his conversion. Novelist, poet, essayist, and journalist, Chesterton was perhaps best known for his Father Brown detective stories. He produced more than 100 volumes in his lifetime, including biographies of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Thomas Aquinas. His <i>Everlasting Man</i>, which set out a Christian outline of history, was one of the factors that wore down Lewis&#x2019; resistance to Christianity. Chesteron was one of the first defenders of orthodoxy to use humor as a weapon. Perhaps more important was his use of reason to defend faith.</p>Heretics is one of Chesterton s most important books. It is also one of his most neglected books. Perhaps the reason has to do with the title. The word heretic conjures up frightful images of controversial characters being barbecued for their beliefs. It smacks of intolerance. The very word dogmatic is perceived as being intolerant. But Chesterton says that man is the animal who makes dogmas. Trees have no dogmas. Turnips are singularly broad-minded. There is something ironic about tolerance being an ideal, and that it is connected to religious freedom. In reality, tolerance has done more to suppress religion than has any persecution. It has left us not only afraid to debate about our beliefs, it has made us afraid even to discuss them. As Chesterton says, We now talk about the weather, and call it the complete liberty of all creeds. This strange silence about religion leaves the impression that religion is not important. There is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy. This is the habit of saying his philosophy does not matter, and this is done universally in the twentieth century... A man s opinion... on Botticelli matters; his opinion on all things does not matter. Chesterton says that we can t get away from the fact that we have a general view of existence, whether we like it or not. It affects and involves everything we say or do, whether we like it or not. And our general view of things is based on our ultimate view of things. Religion is never irrelevant. This book is not an attack but a defense, a defense of the ancient truths that are under attack by modern heretics. Chesterton claims to have gained a deeper appreciation of the Christian Faith through the simple exercise of defending it. He says he never realized the great philosophic common sense of Christianity until the anti-Christian writers pointed it to him. Heresy, it turns out, is usually a distinct lack of common sense. A heresy is at best a half-truth, but usually even less than that. A heresy is a fragment of the truth that is exaggerated at the expense of the rest of the truth. The modern world praises science and hygiene and progress. These are all very well and good, but they have been elevated at the expense of larger truths, such as faith and tradition and permanent ideals. In this book, Chesterton takes on George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and other heretics whose names may not be familiar, even if their heresies are still exceedingly familiar. The original objection to Heretics, which in fact compelled Chesterton to write Orthodoxy, is that his own criticisms of others were not to be taken seriously unless Chesterton himself declared what he stood for. This is perhaps why Heretics is considered the negative for which Orthodoxy is the positive. But any reasonable reader can see that Chesterton s criticisms are a defense of a well-defined position. By criticizing moral and artistic relativism, he is defending identifiable and absolute standards. By criticizing egoism and the cult of success, he is defending humility. By criticizing skepticism, morbidity and muddle-headedness, he is defending faith, hope, and clarity. Clarity. The truth which Chesterton is defending should be obvious. But because Chesterton has to defend it, it obviously isn t obvious. The heretics have obscured the truth, they have distracted us, they have won us over with lies. The first lie is that truth doesn t matter. --Dale Ahlquist, American Chesterton Society</p><h2>Showcase Presents: Superman Family VOL 02</h2><p>Over 500 pages of classic adventures are included in this value-priced volume!This second volume of Superman Family stories stars Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, who get into one off-the-wall situation after another.In Jimmys stories, the cub reporter trades bodies with a gorilla, becomes the Bird Boy of Metropolis, gains the power of Future Vision, and is transformed into a boy from Jupiter.In Loiss stories, the star reporter becomes an enchanting witch, a jailbird and the fattest girl in Metropolis, and then learns the secret of The Girl Who Stole Supermans Heart.</p><p></p><h2>Instant Physics: From Aristotle to Einstein, and Beyond</h2><p>For all of you who break out in a sweat at the thought of thermodynamics, or freeze up at the mention of quantum mechanics, like a bolt from the blue, INSTANT PHYSICS will zap you through the fascinating history of our most basic, yet baffling, science.<br>From the thousand-year search for proof of the existence of the ever-elusive atom to the varied and heated arguments behind the big bang theory, INSTANT PHYSICS answers all the heavy questions with a light touch. You'll learn:<br>* How the Greek philosophers used the sledgehammer of mathematics to break apart the mysteries of the physical universe.<br>* Why gravity is a "romantic" force.<br>* How to tell the difference between a gluon, a meson, and a quark, even if you can't see them.<br>INSTANT PHYSICS is crammed with special features, including chapter summaries, who's who lists, biographical and historical tidbits, and a host of illustrations, photos, equations, diagrams, and drawings.</p><p>I have no mathematical skills. Well, that's not entirely true: I can add and subtract. I can even divide and multiply a bit. But other than that I am pretty hopeless. So physics is definitely not a part of my daily life in any way, shape, or form. <br><br>Now, I work on a lot of Science Fiction books. And occasionally these books bristle with concepts in physics. A lot of the time the physics used does not exist yet in this time and place, but every once and a while there's something that needs to be checked. That's when I go to my reference shelf and dig out a copy of Instant Physics.

To a greater or lesser extent, every president since Wilson has been a War President. Each has committed our country to the pursuit of peace, yet involved us in a seemingly endless series of wars conflicts that the American foreign policy establishment has generally made worse. The chief reason, argues Angelo Codevilla in <i>Advice to War Presidents</i>, is that America's leaders have habitually imagined the world as they wished it to be rather than as it is: They acted under the assumptions that war is not a normal tool of statecraft but a curable disease, and that all the world's peoples wish to live as Americans do. As a result, our leaders have committed America to the grandest of ends while constantly subverting their own goals.<p>Employing many negative examples from the Bush II administration but also ranging widely over the last century, <i>Advice to War Presidents</i> offers a primer on the unchanging principles of foreign policy. Codevilla explains the essentials focusing on realities such as diplomacy, alliances, war, economic statecraft, intelligence, and prestige, rather than on meaningless phrases like international community,&#x201d; peacekeeping&#x201d; and collective security.&#x201d; Not a realist, neoconservative, or a liberal internationalist, Codevilla follows an older tradition: that of historians like Thucydides, Herodotus, and Winston Churchill writers who analyzed international affairs without imposing false categories.</p><p><i>Advice to War Presidents</i> is an effort to talk our future presidents down from their rhetorical highs and get them to practice statecraft rather than wishful thinking, lest they give us further violence.</p></p><p><b>Angelo M. Codevilla</b> has taught political theory and international relations at Stanford, Princeton, and Georgetown University and is presently a professor of international relations at Boston University. He is the author of nine books, including <i>The Character of Nations</i>, <i>The Arms Control Delusion</i>, and a new translation of Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i>. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts.Writing explicitly for an audience that is already familiar with international affairs, Codevilla (<i>The Character of Nations</i>) draws on examples from ancient Greece through the Iraq War to provide a road map for future foreign policy in this accessible but didactic book. In a series of chapters arranged thematically around concepts that include the language of politics and the effectiveness of diplomacy, the author takes issue with the realist, liberal nationalist and neoconservative schools of thought and their ruinous counsel that dominates contemporary international politics, instead advocating a commonsense approach that emphasizes mastering the basic skills of diplomacy and statecraft. Codevilla appeals to the Monroe Doctrine and 19th-century American approaches to foreign affairs while condemning contemporary policy that he believes has failed to secure a lasting peace. Codevilla writes intelligently on topics as diverse as the affect of economic sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s and contemporary relations between Russia and Georgia, but his highly critical style can sometimes be abrasive. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It has been venerated--;or excoriated--as God's word, but so far no one has read the Bible for what it is: humanity's diary, chronicling our ancestors' valiant attempts to cope with the trials and tribulations of life on Earth.<br><br>In <i>The Good Book of Human Nature</i>, evolutionary anthropologist Carel van Schaik and historian Kai Michel advance a new view of Homo sapiens' cultural evolution. The Bible, they argue, was written to make sense of the single greatest change in history: the transition from egalitarian hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies. Religion arose as a strategy to cope with the unprecedented levels of epidemic disease, violence, inequality, and injustice that confronted us when we abandoned the bush--and which still confront us today.<br><br>Armed with the latest findings from cognitive science, evolutionary biology, archeology, and religious history, van Schaik and Michel take us on a journey through the Book of Books, from the Garden of Eden all the way to Golgotha. The Book of Genesis, they reveal, marked the emergence of private property-one can no longer take the fruit off any tree, as one could before agriculture. The Torah as a whole is the product of a surprisingly logical, even scientific, approach to society's problems. This groundbreaking perspective allows van Schaik and Michel to coax unexpected secrets from the familiar stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Able, Abraham and Moses, Jesus of Nazareth and Mary. The Bible may have a dark side, but in van Schaik and Michel's hands, it proves to be a hallmark of human indefatigability.<br><br>Provocative and deeply original, <i>The Good Book of Human Nature</i> offers a radically new understanding of the Bible. It shows that the Bible is more than just a pillar for religious belief: it is a pioneering attempt at scientific inquiry.<br></p><p><br>The Bible is the bestselling book of all time.

Such music becomes the full gospel in action!<br>--Donald P. Hustad, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>." . . one of the most thorough-going volumes on the theology of church music today.

This skillfully edited selection of letters, articles, and notes also includes the short story "A Couple of Writers" and the first chapters of Chandler's last Philip Marlowe novel, <i>The Poodle Springs Story</i>, left unfinished at his death. Paul Skenazy has provided a new introduction for this edition as well as a new selected bibliography.</p><p>The pieces in this collection show the creator of Phillip Marlowe to be a sensitive and thoughtful man, though someone who seemed to like nothing more than speaking his mind. Chandler kept up lively correspondences with friends and in his letters he comments with true candor on books, films, people, and the characters he created. In one priceless letter he berates a publisher over the cover of an edition of <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>: "The bedspring shown in your cover illustration is entirely wrong, since it is a type of spring which is very light and would be useless as a weapon ..." And with that, he's only getting started. In excerpts from his notebooks he holds forth on writing, and one of the masters of the hardboiled mystery passes along much working knowledge of his craft. Chandler's essay "Writers In Hollywood," which first appeared in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1945, holds up wonderfully (though if published today it would require the addition of some zeros to the figures Chandler cites). <i>Raymond Chandler Speaking</i> is a small treasure house of lively thoughts and crisp prose.<b>Raymond Chandler</b> (1888-1959) was born in Chicago but raised in London, returning to the U.S. to live in California in 1919. His first story, "Blackmailers Don't Shoot," was published in 1933 and <i>The Big Sleep</i>, his first novel, in 1939.<b>Paul Skenazy</b> is the author of <i>The New Wild West: The Urban Mysteries of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler</i> and he is Professor of American Literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><h2>Magritte</h2><p>Rene Magritte, a master of fantastic art, was born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898, and despite the age in which he lived - the growth of mass media and mass communication - preferred to live his life in a small suburb of Brussels, painting what he liked to pain and caring little for the theories of his Surrealist contemporaries. The forth paintings illustrated in this book need no words - what Magritte did more than anything else was to p aint meticulously familliar, even personal objects, in unfamiliar, even startling settings - out of context at first sight in both time and place. If beauty lies in the eye of the beholder then so too does understanding - in the interpretation of Magritte&#39;s work the eye, the mind and the heart all compete without a fixed formula or equation but with equal claims.</p><p>This installation of the Modern Master series surveys the work of Rene Magritte, one of the most enigmatic artists of the 20th century and an important figure in the surrealist movement. He combined the commonplace with the fantastic to become the master of &#34;magic realism.&#34; Cloud-filled skies, bowler-hatted men, and oversized household objects are in abundance in the more than 60 full-color reproductions included in this volume.Rene Magritte was born RenE FranAois-Ghislain Magritte in 1898 in Belgium. In March of 1912, Magritte&#39;s mother killed herself by jumping into the river Sambre. The next year, the young artist met his future wife, Georgette Berger; the year after that he enrolled as a pupil at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. In the early 1920s, Magritte served in the military, married Georgette, and worked as a graphic artist, primarily drawing motifs for wallpaper. De Chirico provided a strong early influence. Magritte&#39;s first painting, a portrait of singer Evelyne BrElia, was sold in 1923, and his first surrealist work, Le Jockey Perdu, was painted in 1926. His first exhibition was held in 1927; soon thereafter, he and Georgette moved near Paris and began to meet other surrealists like MirU, Eluard and Arp. His relationships with the surrealists only deepened over the following years: Magritte published his work in various surrealist journals, vacationed with the DalIs, and exhibited with Edward James. At different points during his mature career, he dramatically changed his painting style, only to return to his original surrealist ways. Magritte died in 1967.</p><h2>American Fried: Adventures of a Happy Eater</h2><p>The author describes his cross-country search for the best in such foods as hamburgers, fried chicken, and chili dogs</p><p></p><h2>Touch Not the Unclean Thing : The Text Issue and Separation</h2><p>Touch Not the Unclean Thing The Text Issue and Separation</p><p></p><h2>Star Wars Lost Tribe Of Sith Story Colle</h2><p>Star Wars Lost Tribe of the Sith The Collected Stories</p><p>The <i><b>Fate of the Jedi</b></i> novels introduce readers to a hidden Sith society, living apart from the rest of the galaxy for five thousand years.

Her biography of Byron was described by A. N. Wilson as &#39;a flawless triumph&#39; and William Morris won the Wolfson History Prize and the Writers&#39; Guild Non-Fiction Award. She most recently published Last Curtsey, a memoir of her early life as a debutante. Fiona is a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and an Hon. Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She was awarded the OBE for services to literature in 2009.An English artist-craftsman in the tradition of William Morris, Eric Gill (1882-1940) exemplifies the search for a lifestyle to heal the split between work and leisure, art and industry. He is remembered today for his fine engravings and stone carvings, his legendary typefaces and book designs for the Golden Cockerel Press. Yet there was another side to the man, downplayed by previous biographers: a fervent convert to Catholicism and leader of three Catholic arts-and-crafts communes, Gill had a hyperactive libido which extended to incest with his sisters and daughters, as well as numerous extramarital affairs, according to British writer MacCarthy. He rationalized his penile acrobatics by inventing a bizarre pseudoreligious theory. In MacCarthy's candid portrait, Gill, who preserved the outward image of a devout father-figure, was neither saint nor humbug, but a highly sexed creative artist trapped by his Victorian concept of masculinity. This charismatic firebrand was a renegade Fabian socialist, a bohemian friend of Augustus John and Bertrand Russell. His adventurous life, as re-created in this beautifully written, absorbing biography, is disturbingly relevant to our time.

This work provides an interpretation of that age of European culture. In it, the author argues that while aristocrats and newly prosperous merchants commissioned works of art from the leading artists of the day, vicious commercial battles were being fought over silks and spices, and who should control international trade. As humanism and the &#34;new learning&#34; spread out of Italy across Europe, the prodigious output of the printing presses which sprang up soon dictated - by accident as much as by design - what was to become the European intellectual tradition.</p><p>Drawing from her earlier and more academic studies, Lisa Jardine approaches the challenge of creating a new history of the Renaissance with remarkable bravura and all the boldness required to deliver a fresh and highly readable story of an age we think we know so well. In <b>Worldly Goods</b>, Jardine argues that while the Renaissance was indeed marked by a flourishing cultural identity, it was the material and commercial spirit of the 15th and 16th centuries that set the tone. Commerce and international trade provided the enormous fortunes that funded artistic production, and luxury goods, including great works of art, became important as means of displaying newly acquired wealth and status. It was an urge to own, a ceaseless quest for new horizons and exotic treasures, that fueled the cultural output of the Renaissance, according to Jardine, and that taste for conspicuous displays of opulence characterizes the Western experience of the arts and culture to this day. <p>That <b>Worldly Goods</b> succeeds in telling a captivating new story of the Renaissance is testimony to Jardine's literary and scholarly success at a difficult task. That her book, richly illustrated and well written, makes contemplation of its subject a thrill is testimony of a very good read.</p>ating . . . Jardine's attention to the material side of things is an important explanatory complement to the many histories of the period that have dwelt on the sublime works of art . . . Real history is in the details, the small stories, of which WORLDLY GOODS is a treasure house."<br>Richard Bernstein, The New York Times</p><h2>House of Purple Cedar</h2><p><p>"The hour has come to speak of troubled times. It is time we spoke of Skullyville." Thus begins Rose Goode's story of her growing up in Indian Territory in pre-statehood Oklahoma. Skullyville, a once-thriving Choctaw community, was destroyed by land-grabbers, culminating in the arson on New Year's Eve, 1896, of New Hope Academy for Girls. Twenty Choctaw girls died, but Rose escaped. She is blessed by the presence of her grandmother Pokoni and her grandfather Amafo, both respected elders who understand the old ways. Soon after the fire, the white sheriff beats Amafo in front of the town's people, humiliating him. Instead of asking the Choctaw community to avenge the beating, her grandfather decides to follow the path of forgiveness. And so unwinds this tale of mystery, Indian-style magical realism, and deep wisdom. It's a world where backwoods spiritualism and Bible-thumping Christianity mix with bad guys; a one-legged woman shop-keeper, her oaf of a husband, herbal potions, and shape-shifting panthers rendering justice.

Five-time champion Roger Federer was on track to take his rightful place as the most dominant player in the history of the game. He just needed to cling to his trajectory. So in the last few moments of daylight, Centre Court witnessed a coronation. Only it wasn&#x2019;t a crowning for the Swiss heir apparent but for a swashbuckling Spaniard. Twenty-two-year-old Rafael Nadal prevailed, in five sets, in what was, according to the author, "essentially a four-hour, forty-eight-minute infomercial for everything that is right about tennis&#x2014;a festival of skill, accuracy, grace, strength, speed, endurance, determination, and sportsmanship." It was also the encapsulation of a fascinating rivalry, hard fought and of historic proportions. <p></p><p></p>In the tradition of John McPhee&#x2019;s classic <i>Levels of the Game, Strokes of Genius </i>deconstructs this defining moment in sport, using that match as the backbone of a provocative, thoughtful, and entertaining look at the science, art, psychology, technology, strategy, and personality that go into a single tennis match.With vivid, intimate detail, Wertheim re-creates this epic battle in a book that is both a study of the mechanics and art of the game and the portrait of a rivalry as dramatic as that of Ali&#x2013;Frazier, Palmer&#x2013;Nicklaus, and McEnroe&#x2013;Borg. <p></p></p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Blake Bailey Reviews <em>Strokes of Genius</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong> Blake Bailey is the author of <em>Cheever: A Life</em>, which the <i>New York Times</i> called "a definitive, Dickensian rendering of a complete and complicated life, addictively readable and long overdue." His last book, <em>A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates</em>, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>Strokes of Genius</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p> If, like me, you regard Roger Federer as one of the three or four most glorious athletes in human history, and an awfully nice guy to boot, then the years 2004 to 2007 were golden years for you. This was the "Federer era" in tennis, when he won 11 of 16 Grand Slam tournaments and amassed an astonishing match record of 315-24. Nor was there much of the nasty tension entailed by hard-fought five-set matches; as a fan of Federer, one had only to sit back and sigh at the artistry--the elegant angles, the impossible retrievals, the bazooka forehands--while Federer rose to the occasion (good-naturedly) again and again, usually in straight sets.</p> <p> This belle �poque might have continued, if not for the rise of the musclebound Spaniard, Rafael Nadal, indisputably the greatest clay-court player of all time. For a while it seemed, at worst, that neither Federer nor anyone else would win the French Open as long as Nadal was healthy; but then Nadal began to dominate on faster surfaces, too. Transcending himself in the fifth set, Federer managed to defeat Nadal in the 2007 Wimbledon final (perhaps the third or fourth greatest match ever played) and thus equal Borg's Open-era record of five straight Wimbledon titles. Borg himself, however, predicted that Nadal would not only win the next Wimbledon, but goad the demoralized Federer out of tennis entirely--reminiscent, that is, of McEnroe's effect on Borg, who retired at age 26 after losing his edge in the rivalry.</p> <p> As L. Jon Wertheim points out in <i>Strokes of Genius</i>--his riveting analysis of the 2008 Federer-Nadal Wimbledon final, and an instant classic of tennis literature--the "clashing styles" of the two greats have made theirs the gold standard of sports rivalries: "Feline light versus bovine heavy. Middle European restraint and quiet meticulousness versus Iberian bravado and passion. Dignified power versus an unapologetic, whoomphing brutality. Zeus versus Hercules." A senior writer for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, Wertheim describes the match itself with expertise and �lan ("an oil painting of a forehand volley"), while widening and tightening his lens to examine almost every aspect of the modern game: the curious obsolescence of the serve-and-volley approach; the evolution of the racket (natural gut versus polyester, etc.); the vagaries of various players, most notably Nadal and Federer. (Fun fact: Nadal--whose "awkward" left-hand game has given Federer such fits--is actually right-handed.)</p> <p> These digressions, so nicely deployed, helped distract this reader from a <i>very</i> unhappy ending: 6-4, 6-4, 6-7, 6-7, 9-7, which one fan aptly likened to "watching an angel fall." This much we know (and never mind the woe that, Federer-wise, would follow), but did you know that in England, at 9:20 P.M., there was a 1400-megawatt power surge when millions rose as one from their couches to switch the lights on, released at last from the intolerable tension of the greatest match in history? For that detail, and many like it, you need Wertheim's engrossing book. </p>L.

In this long-awaited work, Henrik Lunde&#x2014;former U.S. Special Forces officer and author of renowned previous works on the campaigns in Norway and Finland&#x2014;turns his sights to the withdrawal of Army Group North.<br><br>Providing cool-headed analysis to the problem, the author first acknowledges that Hitler&#x2014;often accused of holding onto ground for the sake of it&#x2014;had valid reasons in this instance to maintain control of the Baltic coast. Without it, his supply of iron ore from Sweden would have been cut off, German naval (U-boat) bases would have been compromised, and an entire simpatico area of Europe&#x2014;including East Prussia&#x2014;would have been forsaken. On the other hand, Germany&#x2019;s maintaining control of the Baltic would have meant convenient supply for forces on the coast&#x2014;or evacuation if necessary&#x2014;and perhaps most important, remaining German defensive pockets behind the Soviets&#x2019; main drive to Europe would tie down disproportionate offensive forces. Stalwart German forces remaining on the coast and on their flank could break the Soviet tidal wave.<br><br>However, unlike during today&#x2019;s military planning, the German high command, in a situation that changed by the month, had to make quick decisions and gamble, with the fate of hundreds of thousands of troops and the entire nation at stake on quickly decided throws of their dice.<br><br>As Henrik Lunde carefully details in this work, Hitler guessed wrong. By leaving four entire battle-hardened armies in isolation along the Baltic, the Soviets pulling up to the Oder River encountered weaker opposition than they had a right to expect. Having economic (or aid) resources of their own, they cared little for Hitler&#x2019;s own supply line and instead simply lunged at his center of power: Berlin. Once that was taken the remaining German pockets could be wiped out. The Germans deprived themselves of many of their strongest forces when they most needed them, and the climactic battle for their capital took place. <br><br>In this book, both combats and strategy are described in the final stages of the fighting in the Northern Theater, with Lunde&#x2019;s even-handed analysis of the campaign a reward to every student of World War II.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface And Acknowledgments<br>Introduction<br><br>Chapter 1.

Much of Colonel Lunde&#x2019;s troop assignments were in airborne divisions or in Special Forces. Highly decorated on the battlefield, he served three combat tours in Vietnam, and afterward in the Plans and Policy Branch of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. His last Army assignment was Director of National and International Security Studies at the US Army War College. Lunde currently lives in Florida.&#x201c;... tackles "five exceedingly complicated and interrelated subjects to examine and understand Hitler's decision to defend the Baltic States at all costs." They are: military strategy; Hitler's strategic thinking; changing conditions affecting opposing forces; Hitler's fascination with Scandinavia and the Baltic Region; and the validity of Hitler's stated reasons for refusing to withdraw from the Baltic. In his short concluding chapter, Lunde addresses and debunks the validity of the reasons put forth by Hitler for his unshakeable attachment to the defense of the Baltic Region and Scandinavia.&#x201d; (Henry Gole, author of Soldiering, The Road to Rainbow, and co-author of Exposing the Third Reich: Colonel Truman Smith in Hitler's Germany)<br><br>&#x201c;...a detailed examination of one of the worst of Hitler's many bad decisions in the later years of the Second World War, and a valuable addition to the literature on the fighting on the Eastern Front.&#x201d; (<i>History of War</i>)<br><br>"In&nbsp;Hitler's Wave-Breaker Concept, historian and former US Special Forces officer Henrik Lunde undertakes a sober, much-needed corrective evaluation of Hitler's military decisions, with a stress on the defensive actions of Army Group North after the attempt to defeat the Soviet Union had disintegrated.&#x201d; (<i>Michigan War Studies Review</i>)<br><br>"The lessons for political masters and military commanders in this book are numerous and they speak to the challenges of juggling operational and strategic balls concurrently. Lunde has written a very telling book about a region and a campaign that did not adjust to the changing strategic and operational realities on the ground.

I had a great longing to move, she said, to hear another language, eat new food, to be in a country with a long nasty history in the past and as little present history as possible. And so she set out for Mexico--and, incidentally, to write what Bruce Chatwin called the best travel book of the twentieth century, a book of marvels, to be read again and again and again.</p><p>Sybille Bedford was born in 1911, in Charlottenburg, Germany, and was brought up in Italy, England, and France. in 1953, she made her literary debut with A Visit to Don Otavio, and has since published eight other books - including Jigsaw, A Legacy, A Favourite of the Gods, and A Compass Error, as well as classic accounts of criminal trials and other courtroom cases, and an acclaimed biography of her mentor Aldous Huxley. She was vice president of English PEN and one of Britain&#39;s nine Companions of Literature. Ms. Bedford lived in London where she passed away in February 2006.&#34;An absolutely first-class writer at the top of her powers&#34; Mark Amory</p><h2>Fields of fire: A novel</h2><p>They each had their reasons for being a soldier.<br><br>They each had their illusions. Goodrich came from Harvard. Snake got the tattoo �&#x20ac;&#x201d; Death Before Dishonor �&#x20ac;&#x201d; before he got the uniform. And Hodges was haunted by the ghosts of family heroes.<br><br>They were three young men from different worlds plunged into a white-hot, murderous realm of jungle warfare as it was fought by one Marine platoon in the An Hoa Basin, 1969. They had no way of knowing what awaited them. Nothing could have prepared them for the madness to come. And in the heat and horror of battle they took on new identities, took on each other, and were each reborn in fields of fire....<br><br><b>Fields of Fire</b> is James Webb�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s classic, searing novel of the Vietnam War, a novel of poetic power, razor-sharp observation, and agonizing human truths seen through the prism of nonstop combat.

Smack-man came unfocused in the middle of a word, the unformed syllable a dribble of bubbly spit along his chin, and leaned forward, that sudden rush of ecstasy so slow and deep it put him out. His knees bent just a little and he stood there motionless, styled out in a violet suit and turquoise, high-heeled shoes. He had the Wave and his hair was so perfectly frozen into place that he seemed a mimic sculpture of himself, standing there all still with skag.<br><br>Snake peeped into the doorway one more time, still saw no one, and took a deep breath: I owe it to myself. He grabbed a sink with one hand and unloaded with a furious kick, perfectly aimed. Smack-man&#x2019;s head bounced up like a football on a short string, stopping abruptly when his neck ended. Then he slumped onto the floor, out cold, breathing raggedly through a mashed, gushing nose.<br><br>Nothing to it. Never knew what hit him.<br><br>Snake quickly sorted through Smack-man, careful to replace each item as he found it. Two ten&#x2019;s were stuffed inside one pocket. Whatta you know. Smack-man must be a bag man. Smack-man should be ashamed. Snake pocketed the money, laughing to himself: for the good of society, and little kids on dope.<br><br>He stood, pushing his glasses back up his nose, and scratched his head, studying his kill. Well, I gotta go tell Mister Baum. What a bummer.<br><br>And in twenty minutes he was on the street again, walking briskly toward nowhere under winter&#x2019;s lingering chill. His shoulders were raised underneath the gray sweatshirt, guarding hopelessly against the wind. His head was tilted to the side and back. A sneer sat tightly on his face.<br><br>What the hell. You gotta believe in yourself. It was the right thing to do.<br><br>A gust of wind swooped down from the amber mist of sky and chased him, rattling trash. Next to him the door of an abandoned rowhouse swung open and banged. The boards over its windows clapped against the building. His eyes scanned the building quickly and his narrow shoulders raised against the biting wind again, but otherwise there was no reaction from him.<br><br>Gotta be cool, man. Can&#x2019;t let no empty building spook you.<br><br>An old car clanked past him, spewing clouds of oil, and he eyed it also, not breaking his sauntering stride. Driving too slow. Looking for something. Hope it ain&#x2019;t me.<br><br>He was small, with a mop of brittle hair. The hair flopped along his neck, bending with any hint of wind. His face was narrow and anonymous but for the crooked memory of a broken nose and the clear eyes. The eyes were active and intense.<br><br>He left the sidewalk, turning inside a rusted fence, and walked up to a rowhouse stairway. He climbed the outside steps, pondering each one as if searching for an excuse not to ascend it, and did a mull-dance on the landing, finally being chased inside by another gust of wind.<br><br>Hell with it. Need a beer anyway.<br><br>The black stench of air clung to him as he climbed the inside stairs. Sadie stuck her head out on the second landing and he jammed a ten-dollar bill inside her stained cotton robe. The bill never stopped moving. Sadie extracted it with a lightning stroke and ogled it as if it were an emerald. Her wild gray hair came full into the hallway and she called to Snake. He was three steps up from her landing now.<br><br>&#x201c;What you been up to, bad old Snake?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trouble. You know that.&#x201d; He stopped on the stairs for one moment and gave her his ten-dollar sermon. &#x201c;Now, go buy that dog of yours some diapers. Or a box of kitty litter. I&#x2019;m tired of seeing his shit inside the door down there.&#x201d;<br><br>She slammed the door on him. He laughed, continuing up the stairs. Old bitch.<br><br>Inside his own door, a vision on the bed. He blinked once at the greater light and focused. It was his mother, in her bathrobe. She dangled imaginatively on the bed&#x2019;s edge, her chubby legs crossed, neither of them quite touching the floor. Her arms were up behind her head, pushing her hair over the top so that it fell down around her face. She looked as if she were carefully attempting to re-create a picture from some long-forgotten men&#x2019;s magazine. She watched the door with expectant eyes and dropped her hands in disappointment when she saw Snake. He shook his head slightly, then pulled out a cigarette and leaned against the doorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh huh. What are you doing? Paying bills?&#x201d;<br><br>She smoothed a wrinkle on the bed, studying it for a moment, not looking at him. Then she gave her hair a flip. She had bleached it artificial gold again, and she smiled her sugar smile and her sad, remembering voice came across the room on a puffy little cloud, floating lazily to his ears.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re home early, Ronnie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You noticed that.&#x201d;<br><br>She was naked underneath the robe. She leaned forward on the bed, finding the floor with her dangling feet, and the robe fell loosely away, revealing her. Snake shrugged resignedly. Something&#x2019;s going on. Again. He walked to the refrigerator and searched for a beer but they were gone. There had been two six-packs that morning.<br><br>&#x201c;Old Bones out on a job?&#x201d; She nodded, watching him from beside the bed.<br><br>&#x201c;You sure he&#x2019;s working?&#x201d; She laughed a little. He did, too. The old man&#x2019;s antics were legendary and unpredictable.<br><br>&#x201c;Man came for him in a truck this morning and he left with his painting clothes on, carrying a sackload of beer.&#x201d; She shrugged, then looked at Snake with an insightful stare. &#x201c;From the beer I&#x2019;d say he&#x2019;s working. If it was hard stuff...&#x201d; She made a funny face and shrugged again. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s working.&#x201d;<br><br>There was nothing else to drink in the refrigerator. &#x201c;Any coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Instant.&#x201d;<br><br>He put some water on. She eyed him closely, walking from the bed into the kitchen. &#x201c;Why are you home so early? Did you get fired again?&#x201d;<br><br>He spooned the instant into the cup. &#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br><br>She grinned, half-amused and half-curious, her eyes lingering on his wiry body. &#x201c;Was it another fight? How can you stand to fight so much? You&#x2019;re so blind without your glasses! Was it another fight?&#x201d;<br><br>He checked the water. Hot enough. He poured it into the cup. &#x201c;Yup. Sort of.&#x201d;<br><br>She sat down and leaned over the table, admiring him. &#x201c;How can a man be fired for &#x2018;sort of&#x2019; being in a fight?&#x201d;<br><br>He joined her at the table and sipped his coffee. Perfect. Then he lit another cigarette. &#x201c;Well. It all started when I had to clean the women&#x2019;s room.&#x201d; She nodded eagerly, already knowing that he would make it into a great story. She had always told him that he shouldn&#x2019;t fight but she cloyed him with attention when he did. She had always admonished him to be civil but at times like this he was John Wayne, straight out of Dodge City. He casually sipped his coffee.<br><br>&#x201c;I put the sign out in front of the door, you know, so nobody will walk into the room when I&#x2019;m cleaning it. Then I wait until all the girls are out of there, asking each one when she leaves if there&#x2019;s anybody else still in there. I don&#x2019;t want to get into that kind of trouble, moral turpitude is a bust, you know that. Finally I go in and clean the toilets and the sinks, and I&#x2019;m starting to mop the floor when this nigger dude stumbles in. Got a Jones on, I can tell the minute he walks into the room. He&#x2019;s just shot up, too. Don&#x2019;t know where the hell he got off, maybe right there in the movie room. Don&#x2019;t know if he could cook up without being caught but I guess it&#x2019;s as good as any other place. Nobody ever gave a damn when a match was lit that I ever saw. Maybe he was snorting. Who knows. He looked too out of it to be snorting. He was out on his goddamn feet. You know he&#x2019;s out of it if he walks into the wrong bathroom. Moral turpitude and all.&#x201d;<br><br>She reached over and took one of his cigarettes, ogling him as if he were telling a bedtime story. Really grooving on it. &#x201c;Yeah. O.K. So what did you do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take it easy. Don&#x2019;t steal my lines, all right? The dude walks into the bathroom, taking a couple steps and then stopping, nodding out right on his feet, leaning all the way forward at the waist, all the way out. Then he wakes up real quick and goes &#x2018;whoooeeee, whooooooeee,&#x2019; like that, and then falls asleep again, there on his feet. I don&#x2019;t know how the hell he made it to the bathroom. Well. I watch him do that a couple times. He smiles when he wakes up like everything&#x2019;s O.K. I try to check his fingers to see if he&#x2019;s got the poison but I can&#x2019;t tell, and he&#x2019;s pretty strong when he wakes up. Figure he&#x2019;s just got a strong shot in him.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dressed pretty good. That don&#x2019;t always mean anything, I mean, why the hell would he be in a movie in the afternoon if he&#x2019;s worth a shit, it&#x2019;s a lousy movie anyway. But you never can tell.&#x201d;<br><br>He flipped his cigarette into the cluttered sink and slowly lit another, enjoying her eagerness. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t know what to think, to tell you the truth. Coulda been anybody. But I watched him dropping off like that, and checked those clothes out, and I figured it was worth a shot.&#x201d; She nodded quickly to him, smiling, enraptured by his logic. Snake laughed ironically. &#x201c;It was like the Lord his-self delivered him to me. Here we are in the girls&#x2019; room, with a sign out front that says &#x2018;CLOSED,&#x2019; ain&#x2019;t nobody coming in, ain&#x2019;t nobody there to say what happened, this dude is so far gone he could take a picture of me and still not remember me. Well. Just had to make me a play.&#x201d;<br><br>She was still smiling. She leaned forward in anticipation. &#x201c;So you punched his lights out.&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed a little. &#x201c;Well, I thought about it. You know John Wayne woulda dropped him with a poke between the eyes. But I figured the motherfucker would break my hand. Nigger heads are like that, you know? So the next time he gave a whoooeee I kicked him right between the eyes. Pow!&#x201d; He checked her face out. She was ecstatic. It was the high point of her day. &#x201c;Kept my toe pointed so I wouldn&#x2019;t put my foot between his eyes. Don&#x2019;t need no murder rap from a junkie dead inside a toilet. Popped his nose like a light bulb. He had twenty bucks and four bags on him. Took the bucks. Left the bags.&#x201d;<br><br>She stared at him curiously. &#x201c;So how&#x2019;d you get fired?&#x201d;<br><br>He squinted, sipping coffee. The coffee was almost gone. &#x201c;Well, I had to report it. Everybody knew it was me inside the girls&#x2019; room. Found Mister Baum and told him a dude got pushy with me when I tried to make him leave the girls&#x2019; bathroom. Told him the dude looked a little drunk and started shoving me, so I poked him in the face.&#x201d;<br><br>She squinted back. &#x201c;Sounds like a pretty good story to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought so, too. But you know them hebes. Always worrying about getting sued. He tells me, &#x2018;Snake, you can&#x2019;t just go round hitting people when you work in a place like this.&#x2019; I says, &#x2018;Mister Baum, you know I never started a fight in my whole life, but I just can&#x2019;t let people push me round, no matter where I work. What kind of a man lets people push him round?&#x2019; And he says, &#x2018;Snake, I think you done a good job for us but I gotta can you.&#x2019; And he fires me and gives me full pay for the week. Plus I got the nigger&#x2019;s twenty bucks. Not bad, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded approvingly: not bad. &#x201c;What happened to the nigger?&#x201d;<br><br>Snake stacked the coffee cup in the sink. &#x201c;Who cares?&#x201d; His face showed a moment of sparkle. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s got a hair on his ass he&#x2019;ll sue Mister Baum.&#x201d;<br><br>She leaned back in her chair, laughing. Not a bad story. Then she smiled and he could tell she was remembering again. She shook her head a little. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so bad, Ronnie. And so young to be so bad. Doesn&#x2019;t anybody scare you? Don&#x2019;t you like anybody?&#x201d;<br><br>He did not answer. The question was rhetorical. He stifled the retort that once was commonplace, that she was not one to be lecturing anyway. She continued, though, in a rare moment when the emotion of the memory overwhelmed the reality of the present. &#x201c;And you were stupid to quit school. You always did so well.&#x201d;<br><br>Again he did not answer. She&#x2019;s talking about history, he mused. Don&#x2019;t do no good to talk about it. Won&#x2019;t change it. And it was nothing but a hassle, anyway. Rules rules rules.<br><br>She gave him an acquiescent smile and floated those pillowed, remembering words again. &#x201c;Well, I guess you&#x2019;ll be out job-hunting tomorrow morning, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m getting sick of it.&#x201d;<br><br>She shrugged, avoiding his eyes. She had already said too much. Or perhaps it would have been one of the rare days when her memories mounted until they drove him back into the street. Who knows. There was a measured clomping on the stairs then, and the door burst open. No knock.<br><br>A reddened face peered expectantly into the room as if it were his personal possession. The red face was meaty, heavy-bearded, framed by thinning black hair. The nose was mashed and grainy and the eyes seemed dull, unfocused. The man had huge hands and a belly that hung over his belt.<br><br>Snake understood immediately. He felt humiliated, but mostly he was embarrassed at being in the way. She&#x2019;s going to do it, he thought, starting for the door, there&#x2019;s no way I can ever stop that. Her life, anyway. She wants it and I got no right to get pissed. But he looked at the animal that had just entered his home for the purpose of smothering his mother underneath his rolls of fat and muscle, stroking that most special part of her insides, and his neck crawled with a rage that did not delude him as to its depth.<br><br>He knew that he could kill this fat man whose only pertinent fault was that he wanted to fill Snake&#x2019;s mother with the one thing she desired more than anything else. He could kill him and laugh for weeks about it. For one pulsing, heated flash he seriously considered using his knife. Then he became embarrassed at his own rage. I got no right, he decided. Don&#x2019;t do no good, anyway. It&#x2019;s what she wants. Hell with it.<br><br>Fat Man looked dully at his mother, seemingly too unfocused to understand. Maybe he&#x2019;s jealous, Snake mused. That&#x2019;s a laugh. He decided that he must leave the apartment, get out of their way. Fat Man was still standing in the door, half in and half out, trying to figure the whole thing out. Snake reminded himself that he would have to laugh about Fat Man once he escaped the apartment. Christ, is the bastard dumb. Where does she find &#x2018;em? But I bet he has a big one.<br><br>He turned to his mother and said, for the benefit of Fat Man, &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m cutting out, Mom.

A straightforward beginning to a carol that grows increasingly complicated as both the list of presents and the numbers involved accumulate. Brett's lavish treatment of the song portrays various levels of meaning; she has illustrated the fantastic gifts in outrageous splendor (seven swans swim in folkloric Russian headdresses), turned them into a border of tree decorations, included a menagerie of animals carrying banners with "Merry Christmas" in different languages, and set into the outer edges of each page an ongoing story about a family's preparations for the big day itself. In the final frame, the decorated tree serves as the centerpiece for their own caroling. The artist demonstrates, once again, that she will not relinquish a project before every last glorious detail is in place; the clarity of her vision is stunning. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Land of Remorse: A Study of Southern Italian Tarantism</h2><p>The Land of Remorse (La Terra del Rimorso, first Italian edition 1961) is a classic work by Ernesto De Martino, the founding figure of Italian cultural anthropology and ethnopsychiatry. Based on fieldwork conducted in the Salentine peninsula of Southern Italy in 1959, the study deals with the phenomenon of Apulian tarantism, a form of possession related to the belief in the bite of a mythical tarantula and its ritual cure in the tarantella dance. De Martino draws together the contributions of various specialists who participated in the fieldwork, including a psychologist, a psychiatrist, an ethnomusicologist and a social anthropologist. As both an ethnologist and classically-trained religious historian, the author reviews the fieldwork data through the lens of tarantism&#39;s historical analysis. The result is a compassionate and compelling account of tarantism, which no longer appears as mere mental illness or as a &#34;survival&#34; of shamanistic irrationality, but as a product of a cultural history defined from above, endowed with its own forms of rationality. This annotated edition, translated by Dorothy Zinn, includes the fieldwork photographs of those afflicted by tarantism as they perform the ritual exorcism, an example of the author&#39;s early use of visual methods in ethnographic research.</p><p></p><h2>Killjoy</h2><p>Why is everyone afraid of Gabriella Paston?

The perfect blend of Yoga and Nautilus, Pilates concentrates on building strength and flexibility, improving coordination, balance, and posture, and increasing stamina. All Pilates movements are initiated by muscles in the abdominal area (known as the powerhouse) and are designed to work the smaller muscles that support larger ones, while stretching and lengthening the entire muscular package. A low-impact yet highly intense workout, Pilates is ideal for everyone, young or old, those who are extremely fit or out of shape, as well as those who have chronic pain, injuries, or asthma.Illustrated with over 100 black-and-white photographs, The <i>Pilates Powerhouse</i> brings this time-efficient and highly effective means to get and stay in shape into the home, without the need for expensive classes and elaborate equipment. Using only a mat, a stick and, for advanced Pilates, a ball, readers will feel personally trained by Mari Winsor's innovative routines and spirited instruction, reaping the dramatic and lasting results of Pilates in less than an hour a day.</p><p>Help your butt say "neener neener!" to Father Time. Join some of Hollywood's best bodies (Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny Glover) who've gone gaga over the Pilates method of body conditioning. (It's intriguingly referred to as "the method" for short). Celebrities, professional athletes, dancers, and models drop $50 or more for each private lesson on the Pilates equipment (which includes contraptions with potentially dangerous-looking straps and springs, with intimidating names like the Cadillac and the Reformer). If you'd rather not shell out cash like that to help your rear defy gravity--especially when at least three classes a week are recommended--take heart. Mari Winsor, one of L.A.'s most popular Pilates instructors, has brilliantly collected the essential exercises--none of which requires any equipment other than perhaps a carpeted floor--into a supremely inspiring, snappily written, simple-to-follow handbook, perhaps the perfect book for new moms, business travelers looking to stay fit while on the road, and the swimsuit-phobic alike.<p> Despite the recent wave of Pilates (that's <i>Pi-lah-teez</i>) enthusiasts singing its praises to magazines like <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Elle</i>, the system has been around since World War I; George Balanchine and Martha Graham used the exercises to add strength without bulking up, perfect their posture, prevent injury, increase flexibility, and improve circulation. Indeed, a person who's completed a Pilates workout has a rather orgasmic glow; the workout is aerobic but not so much as to cause much sweating. This is not to say it's easy; while your behind gets a great lift, the exercises focus on the abs, or "powerhouse." Each exercise is clearly explained next to step-by-step photographs of Winsor's fabulous bod. Unlike in most exercise guides, you won't see Winsor promising remarkable results in minimum time--she says an hour a day is what you need to give to reap the Pilates benefits, but adds, "In the other twenty-three hours you will not only enjoy yourself more, but will find that you have more quality time."</p><p> Winsor even goes so far in her praise of the method to mention that she hasn't had a full-blown asthma attack since she started faithfully following the program. She adds, "it has helped me recover from devastating injuries, it has transformed my self-image and sense of worth, and it keeps me calm and centered every day." Not bad results from a workout you can do in the comfort of your own home--for free. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>The Pilates trainer-to-the-stars, <b>Mari Winsor</b> owns and operates two Pilates studios in the Los Angeles area.

They've got a two hundred year-old house, an autistic son obsessed with the Titanic, and 17 chickens, at last count. It's the kind of paradise where stay-at-home moms team up to cook the school's "hot lunch," dads grill grass-fed burgers, and, as Lucy observes, "chopping kale has become a certain kind of American housewife's version of chopping wood."<br><br>When friends at a wine-soaked dinner party reveal they've made their marriage open, sensible Lucy balks.

Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, self-published this work just before her rampage against the king of Pop Art made her a household name and resulted in her confinement to a mental institution. But the Manifesto, for all its vitriol, is impossible to dismiss as just the rantings of a lesbian lunatic. In fact, the work has indisputable prescience, not only as a radical feminist analysis light-years ahead of its timepredicting artificial insemination, ATMs, a feminist uprising against under-representation in the artsbut also as a stunning testament to the rage of an abused and destitute woman.<br><br>The focus of this edition is not on the nostalgic appeal of the work, but on Avital Ronell&#x2019;s incisive introduction, &#x201c;Deviant Payback: The Aims of Valerie Solanas.&#x201d; Here is a reconsideration of Solanas&#x2019;s infamous text in light of her social milieu, Derrida&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Ends of Man&#x201d; (written in the same year), Judith Butler&#x2019;s <i>Excitable Speech</i>, Nietzsche&#x2019;s Ubermensch and notorious feminist icons from Medusa, Medea and Antigone, to Lizzie Borden, Lorenna Bobbit and Aileen Wournos, illuminating the evocative exuberance of Solanas&#x2019;s dark tract.</p><p><b>Avital Ronell</b> teaches at New York University, The European Graduate School and Paris VIII, and is the author of many books including <i>The Test Drive</i>.&#x201c;The <i>SCUM Manifesto</i> is a document of profound vulnerability, written in a voice of profound empowerment.

But our gardens are also extensions of the natural world, conversations between us and the lands we live upon and beside. Through our gardens, as well as other neighborhood greenspaces we can actually help counter some of the woes faced by larger environments: rampant development, loss of plant and animal habitat, the spread of invasive species, the exploitation of natural resources, air and water pollution, and the impacts of global warming. Yes, even our small, urban, backyard landscapes can help combat such man-made strains on our local environments. And it's surprisingly easy to do!<br><br>In his new book, <i>The Northwest Garden Manifesto</i>, scientist and gardener John J. Albers teams up with photographer, David E. Perry to create a comprehensive and visually stunning guide to encourage and enable each of us to consider the local ecosystem in our own gardens. The ideas and concepts in this book reflect the most up-to-date thinking on urban ecology and how to best make our yards reflect the natural world around us.&nbsp;The key to Albers's approach is for gardeners to first assess the current state of their property and then focus on the following key principles:<br><br>1. Protect, conserve and create healthy soil<br>2. Maintain healthy plants and create a sustainable landscape<br>3. Conserve water and other natural resources<br>4. Protect water and air quality<br>5. Protect and enhance wildlife habitat<br>6. Conserve energy<br>7. Use sustainable methods and materials.<br> Through clear explanation, practical examples, and full-color photos, Albers and Perry show how to evaluate any yard in terms of these principles and then challenges the reader to improve each element, one step at a time. From creating better soil to starting a compost pile, attracting pollinators to adding more native plants, or creating a simple circulating water feature to building a fence from recycled wood--gardeners will ultimately turn their backyards into beautiful, healthy, and happy habitat for all.</p><p><b></b> <b> Dr. John J.

We were renovating a clothing store in a strip mall outside the city. Nothing tremendous. I finished the proposal on a Friday morning and dropped it on his desk with a cheerful little note&#x2014;&#x201c;Let me know what you think!&#x201d;&#x2014;while he was in a meeting with a new client in the conference room. Later that morning Leon threw open his office door with<br>a bang.<br><br>&#x201c;Amanda!&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Come in here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I rushed to his office. He picked up a handful of papers off his desk and stared at me, his flabby face white with anger.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell is this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; It looked like my proposal&#x2014;same heading, same format. My hands shook. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine what was wrong. Leon handed me the papers and I read the first line: Leon Fields is a cocksucking faggot.<br><br>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; I asked Leon.<br><br>He stared at me. &#x201c;You tell me. You just dropped it on my desk.&#x201d;<br><br>My head spun. &#x201c;What are you talking about? I put the proposal on your desk, not this, the proposal for the new job.&#x201d;<br><br>I sifted through the papers on his desk for the proposal I had dropped off. &#x201c;What is this, a joke?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Amanda,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Three people said they saw you go to the printer, print this out, and bring it to my desk.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt like I had stepped into a bad dream. There was no logic, no reason anymore. <br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I said to Leon. I ran back to my desk, printed out the proposal, checked it, and brought it back to Leon&#x2019;s office. He had calmed down a little and was sitting in his big leather chair.<br><br>I handed it to him. &#x201c;This is it. This is exactly what I put on your desk this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked over the papers and then looked back up at me. &#x201c;Then where did that come from?&#x201d; He looked back at the fake proposal on the desk.<br><br>&#x201c;How would I know?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let me see it again.&#x201d;<br><br>I read the second line: Leon Fields eats shit and likes it.<br><br>&#x201c;Disgusting,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Someone playing a trick on you, I guess. Someone thinks it&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or playing a trick on you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Someone replaced your proposal with this. I&#x2019;m sorry, I thought&#x2014;&#x201d; he looked around the office, embarrassed. In the three years I had<br>worked for him I had never heard Leon Fields apologize to anyone, ever.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;What were you supposed to think?&#x201d;<br><br>We looked at each other.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look over the proposal,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get back to you soon.&#x201d;<br><br>I left his office and went back to my own desk. I hadn&#x2019;t written the fake proposal, but I wished I knew who did. Because it was true; Leon Fields was a cocksucking faggot, and he did eat shit, and I had always suspected that he liked it very much.<br>2<br><br>THAT EVENING I WAS telling my husband, Ed, about the little mystery at work when we heard the tapping for the first time. We were sitting at the dinner table, just finishing a meal of take-out Vietnamese.<br><br>Tap-tap.<br><br>We looked at each other.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;<br><br>Again: tap-tap. It came in twos or fours, never just one&#x2014;tap-tap&#x2014;and the sound had a drag on it, almost a scratching behind it, like claws on a wood floor. <br><br>First Ed stood up, then me. At first, the sound seemed to be coming from the kitchen. <br><br>So we walked to the kitchen and bent down to listen under the base of the refrigerator and look under the stove, but then it seemed to be coming from the bathroom. In the bathroom we checked under the sink and behind the shower curtain, and then we determined it was coming from the bedroom. So we walked to the bedroom, and then to the living room, and then back to the kitchen again. After we toured the apartment we gave up. It was the pipes, we decided, something to do with the water flow or the heating system. Or maybe a mouse, running around and around the apartment inside the walls. Ed was revolted by the idea but I thought it was kind of cute, a little mouse with the spunk to make it up four stories and live on our few crumbs. We both forgot about the story I had been telling, and I never told Ed about the practical joke at work.<br><br>***<br><br>THE TAPPING went on for the rest of the winter. Not all the time, but for a few minutes every second or third night. Then at the end of the month I went to a conference on the West Coast for two days, and Ed noticed that he didn&#x2019;t hear it at all while I was gone. A few weeks later Ed went to a distant cousin&#x2019;s wedding up north for three days. The tapping went on all night, every night, while he was gone. I searched the apartment again, chasing the sound around and around. I examined the pipes, checked every faucet for drips, turned the heat on and off, and still the tapping continued. I cleaned the floors of any crumbs a rodent could eat, I even bought a carton of unpleasant little spring traps, and the sound was still there. I turned up the television, ran the dishwasher, spent hours on the phone with old, loud friends, and still I heard it.<br><br>Tap-tap.<br><br>I was starting to think this mouse wasn&#x2019;t so cute anymore.<br>3<br><br>THE NOISE WASN&#x2019;T SO unusual, really; our building was close to a hundred years old and one expected that kind of noise. It had been built as an aspirin factory when the city still had an industrial base. After the industry moved out, one developer after another had tried to do something with the neighborhood, full of abandoned factories and warehouses like ours, but the schemes never took off. It was too far from the city, too desolate, too cold at night. As far as I was concerned it was better that the development hadn&#x2019;t gone as planned. Our building was still only half full. I liked the peace and quiet.<br><br>The first time we saw the loft I was absolutely sure it was the home for us. Ed needed a little convincing.<br><br>&#x201c;Think of the quiet!&#x201d; I told Ed. &#x201c;No neighbors!&#x201d;<br><br>Conduits were in place for lighting and plumbing but they had never been utilized. We would have to do major renovation.<br><br>&#x201c;Think of the possibilities!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;We can build it from scratch!&#x201d;<br><br>Six white columns held up the place. Heat was provided by an industrial blower hung from the ceiling. &#x201c;It has character,&#x201d; I told Ed. &#x201c;It has a personality!&#x201d;<br><br>He relented, and we got the place at half of what we would have paid elsewhere. We spent the extra money on renovation. Ed gave me free rein to do as I pleased. I was an architect and now I could be my own dream client. I designed every detail myself, from the off-white color of the walls to the porcelain faucets on the kitchen sink to the installation of the fireplace along the south wall, which cost a fortune, but was worth the money.<br><br>The neighborhood, though, was sometimes difficult. No supermarkets, no restaurants, a few small grocery stores that specialized in beer and cigarettes. The edge of the closest commercial district for shopping was ten blocks away, and the nearest residential area was on the other side of that. But we adjusted quickly. We had a car to take us wherever we wanted on nights and weekends, and during the week we usually took the train to work. Our other concern when we first moved in was the crime, but soon enough we found out there was none. It was too desolate even for criminals. I did, however, come to be scared of the stray dogs that patrolled the neighborhood. The dogs kept their distance and I kept mine but I always felt it was an uneasy truce. I didn&#x2019;t trust the animals to keep their side of the bargain. Walking home from the train I would spot one lurking in a doorway or on a street corner, eyeing me with suspicion. I was sure I would have preferred a mugger, who at least would only want my money&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t know what these dogs wanted when they looked at me with their bloodshot eyes.<br><br>That fall I found out when a German shepherd mix followed me home from the train station one night. I thought running would only provoke him, so I continued to walk at a regular pace, faking nonchalance. The German shepherd trailed behind at an equally steady pace, also faking nonchalance. At the entrance to my building, a steel door up two wide steps, I put my key in the lock and thought I was home free&#x2014;the dog stayed on the street. And then in one great leap he jumped up the two steps and attacked. With his front paws, as strong as human hands, he pushed me against the wall, ignoring my horrified screams, licked me right on my mouth and tried to seduce me. When I finally convinced him I wasn&#x2019;t interested, he sat down by my feet, panting with a big smile. I spent a few minutes scratching behind his ears and then sneaked through the door.<br><br>I would have forgotten about him except that the next day he was waiting for me at the train station again, and the day after that. Walking home with him became a routine. He knew a few simple commands (&#x201c;sit,&#x201d; &#x201c;stay,&#x201d; &#x201c;no&#x201d;) and I was convinced he had started off life as somebody&#x2019;s pet. I even went to a pet store and bought a bag of nutritionally balanced dog biscuits for him. On our walks home from the train I used the biscuits to teach him a few more commands&#x2014;walk, lie down, stop-trying-to-fuck me (which we abbreviated as Stop). I hoped that if I got him into more civilized condition I could find a home for him. I would have liked to take him in myself but Edward was allergic; dogs, cats, hamsters, strawberries, angora, and certain types of mushrooms were all hazardous materials, to be kept out of the apartment and handled with care.<br><br>But I was glad to have at least one friend in the neighborhood. And over the next few months it was my new friend, a nameless flea-ridden mutt, rather than Ed, who would be the first to see that I was not entirely myself.<br><br>***<br><br>NOT THAT Ed wasn&#x2019;t attentive, not that he didn&#x2019;t notice what was going on in my life. He just wasn&#x2019;t able to put the pieces together as quickly as the dog. Ed was my hero, my savior. Ed was the man who had imposed order on my my chaotic life. When I was single, I&#x2019;d eaten cereal for dinner and ice cream for lunch. I&#x2019;d kept my tax records in a shopping bag in the closet. I&#x2019;d spent Saturdays in a hungover fog, watching hours of old black-and-white movies. With Ed I spent Saturdays outdoors, doing the things I had always imagined I should do: flea markets, lunches, museums. He did our taxes, with itemized deductions, every January, and filed the records away in a real file cabinet. Here was a man who could finish any crossword puzzle, open any bottle, reach the top shelf at the grocery store without strain. Here was stability, here was something I could rely on, my rock, day in and day out. Someone who loved me, who would never leave me alone. You can&#x2019;t blame this sophisticated, civilized man for not having the same instincts as a wild dog.</p><h2>The Cruise Control Diet: Automate Your Diet and Conquer Weight Loss Forever</h2><p><b>Activate your weight-loss autopilot&#x2014;use the power of simple intermittent fasting to lose the pounds and keep them off, from Hollywood trainer and #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Jorge Cruise.</b><br><br> Timing is everything when it comes to losing weight.

What&#x2019;s unique about Cruise Control is the multifaceted approach used to achieve total body transformation. You are going to incorporate strategies that address the psychological, physiological, genetic, and sociological components for a truly remarkable metamorphosis. In short, Cruise Control is a comprehensive approach to boost your overall well-being with four powerful secrets:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Step 1: Nutrient Timing: </b>The secret weapon of Cruise Control is the consumption of food nutrients in rhythm with your body&#x2019;s burning (fasting) and boosting (eating) cycles. I believe this is a missing link to building a healthy body and cleansing it of unwanted toxins and stubborn fat. By consuming solid foods within a finite window of time each day, your body is able to fully utilize the nutrients you eat and to cleanse, recharge, repair, and restore. On Cruise Control, you&#x2019;ll eat Boost Zone foods during an eight-hour window each day. You already know that the average American eats for fifteen or more hours of the day. We&#x2019;re simply flipping the script. It&#x2019;s so incredibly simple and straightforward. Instead of grazing for the majority of the day, after your eight hours are completed, you&#x2019;ll enjoy healthy and satisfying Burn Zone beverages, snacks, and treats during the other sixteen hours of the day. These strategies will give your body the time it needs to clean, repair, and recharge itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> It boils down to this: you&#x2019;ll eat during the eight-hour time of the day that works for you (see &#x201c;Choose Your Window,&#x201d; below). It really doesn&#x2019;t matter other than choosing a time that works with your schedule.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Step 2: Manipulate Your Nutrients: </b>On Cruise Control you&#x2019;ll be manipulating your macronutrient intake at different times of the day to ignite your body&#x2019;s natural fat-burning<br> ability and boost your metabolism. How? More on this in the next chapter, but here&#x2019;s the short version:<br> � You&#x2019;ll eat a wide variety of delicious foods abundant in healthy fats and oils.<br> � You&#x2019;ll enjoy moderate amounts of the highest-quality protein.<br> � You&#x2019;ll eat a reasonable amount of yummy, healthy, nutrient-dense, and carbohydrate-containing foods.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Burning at a Glance: </b>During the sixteen-hour<br> Burn Zone, you&#x2019;ll enjoy treats and beverages made of 100 percent healthy fats. Following this protocol will restrict the amount of glucose you consume, cutting off the glucose supply to your cells, lowering insulin levels, and ultimately forcing your body to burn fat for fuel.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Boosting at a Glance: </b>During the eight-hour Boost Zone, your diet will consist of 50 percent fat, 30 percent carbohydrates, and 20 percent protein. This breakdown of nutrients helps your body to rev up your metabolism and to pump up your health and vitality. Don&#x2019;t bother with your calculator. I&#x2019;ve done all the math for you.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Step 3: Friendly Fats: </b>Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a form of saturated fatty acids that come with many health benefits including increased brain function and healthy weight management. Coconut oil is a top source of MCTs, comprised of nearly 65 percent of total fatty acids. This type of fat produces four times more brain-friendly energy in the form of ketones compared to regular coconut oil. MCTs are also called medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and are largely missing from our industrialized diets. Why? Because the public has been misled to believe that all forms of saturated fats are potentially harmful. Quite the contrary, as compared to other types of oils and fats, MCTs seem to have positive effects on fat burning and weight reduction. As part of a healthy diet, MCTs and coconut oil can help increase satiety and even raise the metabolic rate at which the body functions. Since you will be fasting for sixteen hours a day, it&#x2019;s essential that you embrace these healthy fats as your friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Step 4: Caffeine: </b>I have developed a delicious recipe for Cruise Control Coffee (or tea) that is filled with energizing antioxidants and caffeine, and all the best healthy fats you need to stay satisfied and revved up all day long. Additionally, I recommend organic food sources of caffeine combined with powerful antioxidants such as green and black tea (unsweetened) to give you that extra boost of energy as you begin to transition from your current eating habits. Caffeine can help with a temporary lack of energy. In addition, having your coffee in the morning can be an especially helpful fuel for your brain. Research shows that a breakfast cup of coffee can increase ketones, the brain-friendly energy produced when your insulin levels are low enough. Scientific studies also show that caffeine defends against cognitive decline and reduces the risk of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and it increases insulin sensitivity in healthy humans, which is extremely important to sustained weight loss. Why does it boost your mood? Coffee may alter serotonin and dopamine activity for a short-term emotional boost, while the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds in coffee have been linked to long-term effects on mood.</p><h2>Requiem: New Collected Works by Robert A. Heinlein and Tributes to the Grand Master</h2><p>A collection of works--most never before published in book form--by the first Grand Master (Science Fiction Writers of America). Includes major novellas &#34;Tenderfoot in Space&#34; and &#34;Destination Moon,&#34; which was made into the famous George Pal film. Tributes from Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Silverberg, and Tom Clancy. &#34;A fine memorial.&#34;--Arthur C. Clarke.</p><p>Another of science fiction's weird hybrids, comprising fiction, poems, speeches, reminiscences, and appreciations by and about Robert A. Heinlein (1907-88), one of the most successful and influential science fiction writers of the modern era. Part I features the famous title story, six previously uncollected miscellaneous pieces, and four speeches that Heinlein delivered at sf conventions. Part II reprints the speeches given at the Heinlein retrospective at the National Air and Space Museum in October 1988. Part II consists of tributes to the Grandmaster from, among others, Poul Anderson, Greg Bear, Arthur C. Clarke, Joe Haldeman, Larry Niven, Spider Robinson, Robert Silverberg, and Jack Williamson. Among the more interesting entries are ``Destination Moon,'' the story that formed the basis for the innovative 1950 movie, co-scripted by Heinlein; and Heinlein's account of his involvement in making the movie--essential reading for sf-movie buffs. Elsewhere, Spider Robinson's egregious, ranting defense of Heinlein against mostly unspecified detractors will raise a few eyebrows; contrast Robert Silverberg's panegyric, a more reliable summary of Heinlein's substantial and lasting contribution to the field. Sentimental hagiography. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The New Collected Works portion of this memorial to Heinlein ( Stranger in a Strange Land ) is a delight. Best of these stories, essays and speeches are "Shooting Destination Moon ," an essay on the movie that follows the story on which the film was based, and the prescient Guest of Honor speeches from the World Science Fiction Conventions of 1941 and 1961. Heinlein's contributions, while not necessarily representing his best work, are always thought-provoking and never boring. In contrast, the tributes by such luminaries as Tom Clancy, L. Sprague and Catherine Crook de Camp, Arthur C. Clarke and Spider Robinson offer tedious variations on adulation. The sole exception is Larry Niven's story "The Return of William Proxmire," in which the senator blocks the space program with a time machine. He keeps Heinlein in the Navy and forestalls the body of writing that would influence many to pursue careers in space.

Note: I do not ship to jails or institutions.</p><p>In the early 1830s, Sarah Grimk� and her younger sister, Angelina, were the most infamous women in America. They had rebelled so vocally against their family, society, and their religion that they were reviled, pursued, and exiled from their home city of Charleston, South Carolina, under threat of death. Their crime was speaking out in favor of liberty and equality and for African American slaves and women, arguments too radically humanist even for the abolitionists of their time. Their lectures drew crowds of thousands, even (shockingly, then) men, and their most popular pamphlet directly inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>--published 15 years later. These women took many of the first brutal backlashes against feminists and abolitionists, but even their names are barely known now. Sue Monk Kidd became fascinated by these sisters, and the question of what compelled them to risk certain fury and say with the full force of their convictions what others had not (or could not). She discovered that in 1803, when Sarah turned 11, her parents gave her the &#x201c;human present&#x201d; of 10-year-old Hetty to be her handmaid, and Sarah taught Hetty to read, an act of rebellion met with punishment so severe that the slave girl died of "an unspecified disease" shortly after her beating. Kidd knew then that she had to try to bring Hetty back to life (&#x201c;I would imagine what might have been," she tells us), and she starts these girls' stories here, both cast in roles they despise. She trades chapters between their voices across decades, imagining the Grimk� sisters&#x2019; courageous metamorphosis and, perhaps more vitally, she gives Hetty her own life of struggle and transformation. Few characters have ever been so alive to me as Hetty and Sarah. Long after you finish this book, you'll feel its courageous heart beating inside your own. -- <em>Mari Malcolm</em>Sue Monk Kidd is the award-winning and bestselling author of the novels&nbsp;<i>The Secret Life of Bees&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Mermaid Chair</i>.

His machine doesn't work for the judges, however, and Alistair loses the competition. A dejected Alistair wheels his machine away from the school, thinking, "He knew that his time machine worked. . .but how could he prove it?" while the visual punchline shows the woolly mammoths hovering ominously behind the school. Text and illustration are well-matched in this amusing book; the deadpan, uninflected prose is a perfect counterpoint to the brightly exaggerated, cartoon-like pictures. The attractive illustrations add a lot to the humor of the book. The perennial appeal of time-travel fantasies, Alistair's situation (he is right, but unrecognized by the "real" adult world), and the effective blend of story and artwork will make this a winner with young children.

The farmers, <i>b�aires</i> and<i>�caires,</i> took a second, and then a third crop of hay from the rich grasslands of the valleys on the Burren. The limestone mountains of Cappanabhaile and of Mullaghmore sparkled silver in the warm light, storing up the heat for the winter months, and the cows grew fat on lowland grass that was moistened by nightly mists and warmed by daily sunlight.Sunrise had come to the Burren at half an hour after seven on the morning of 31 October, the feast of <i>Samhain.</i> First the rounded terraces of Mullaghmore showed blue against the pale gold of the sky. Then the low sun of an autumn dawn dyed the polished pavements with a saffron glow. The aromatic purple-grey smoke of peat fires rose lazily into the air and the cattle came swaying across the stony fields on their way to the milking cabins, their plaintive lowing forming a soft musical background to the early morning scene.Mara, Brehon of the Burren and <i>ollamh,</i> professor, of the law school, stood in her garden and looked over towards the ancient enclosure of Cahermacnaghten. Her six law scholars were noisily awake to the world, energetically pumping water from the well, banging the door of the scholars' house, joking with Brigid in the kitchen house, carrying a basket of sods of turf into the schoolhouse, shouting, jostling each other, the young voices drowning the lonely <i>chack, chack</i> of the plump fieldfares overhead. Cumhal, Brigid's husband and Mara's farm manager, was chopping logs outside the house where he and Brigid lived and one of the farm workers was walking the cows into the milking parlour.It was time for lessons, but Mara lingered for a fewprecious moments in her garden, gazing with deep pleasure at the magenta cranesbill, the soft-blue harebells and the mauve pincushion flowers, each colour framed by a diamond shape of limestone strips and all still blooming as if it were late summer. It had been such a beautiful autumn with almost no frosts and even now, though the leaves had mostly fallen from the trees, the sunlight brought an aromatic scent from the sharp green needles of the two rosemary bushes that grew beside her gate. With a sigh she shook herself and started to walk towards the law school. Her life was a busy one and today promised to be even busier than usual. As Brehon of the Burren she was not only responsible for law and order in that stony kingdom but also had the added responsibility of her teaching duties at the law school.'Brigid, I don't think that I will take the boys with me to Father David's burial service,' she said, putting her head in through the door of the kitchen house. 'They'll have to go to Mass tomorrow as it's the Feast of All Saints and then again on Sunday. I think three times a week is too much. Fachtnan can supervise them for an hour or two and then they can have a game of hurley and an early dinner if I'm delayed for any reason.'Brigid, a small sandy-haired woman, was flying around the kitchen, clearing away the porridge bowls, and wiping spills of honey from the large wooden table. She smiled now, looking at the tall, slim figure with a world of affection in her light green eyes. Mara's mother had died when she was young and Brigid, housekeeper to Mara's father, Semus O'Davoren, Brehon of the Burren, had been more than a mother to her.'That's probably a good idea, Brehon,' Brigid nodded approval. 'Fachtnan is a great boy, he's very good with the younger ones and Cumhal will be chopping wood in the yard for the next few hours so if Moylan or Aidan give any trouble he'll pop in and sort them out. I'll get Sean to saddle your mare now and you can be on the way. Mass is at eight o'clock, isn't it?''What would I do without you and Cumhal?' Mara smiled back over her shoulder as she went out. It was amazing how Brigid always managed to do so many jobs at the same moment, vigorously swilling out the porridge pot, casting a quick appraising glance over Mara and nodding approval of the fur-lined mantle, the dark hair neatly braided over her head, the green gown over the snowy white <i>l�ine;</i> while shouting orders about the mare to Sean, checking the time by the candle clock on the shelf, throwing a few extra sods of turf on the kitchen fire and then rapping loudly on the open shutter at the window as a signal to the scholars that morning school was going to start.They were all sitting very upright in their desks when she went into the schoolhouse. Ten-year-old Shane and twelve-year-old Hugh were on the front bench; behind them were the two fourteen-year-olds, Aidan and Moylan, and the two older ones were at the back. Enda was sixteen and Fachtnan, who also acted as her assistant, was eighteen; both were due to take their final examinations next summer.<i>'Samhain</i> tonight, boys,' said Mara. 'You'll have to work hard for Fachtnan if you want to have time to get ready for your party and for the festival afterwards.''Will we have the afternoon off, Brehon?' asked Moylan eagerly.'Sometimes we even have nearly the whole day off,' said Aidan eyeing her hopefully.'I can't remember that,' said Mara drily. 'However, I will have to attend the burial of Father David from Rathborney now, so I suppose if everyone works very well for Fachtnan this morning, I might think of cancelling lessons for this afternoon.'&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The dawn sun, low in a pale yellow sky, was almost blinding as she walked her mare sedately down the steeply spiralling path leading to Rathborney valley. The air was very clear and she could see people converging on the church from all directions, some walking, some riding, all determined to pay their last respects to a popular and devout old man.There were figures also on the path that led from Newtown Castle, home of a prosperous silversmith and mine owner. Mara narrowed her eyes and leaned forward. Yes, it was Sorley Skerrett, the silversmith himself and Rory the bard was beside him. Mara could hear a loud laugh; the pair seemed to be best of friends. Mara lingered. After what she had learned of him last night, she had no inclination to meet Sorley again. He would probably go in by the nearby gate and would be in the church before she arrived there herself.The bell had not yet tolled by the time that Mara reached the bottom of the hill. To her annoyance Sorley was still at the gate, engaged in earnest conversation with Bishop Mauritius O'Brien, who, no doubt, had come to honour the dead priest. Mara watched with amusement as Sorley produced a beautiful communion cup from a leathersatchel. So that was why he was here - not to pay his respects to the dead, but to sell to the living. They were talking earnestly and Mara did not wish to meet either so she continued up the lane towards Gleninagh mountain, and entered the churchyard by the gate near to the old church ruins. There was a cart, with a young man holding the reins of the patient donkey, a little way up the lane and as Mara tied her horse to a nearby tree, a sturdily built man, wearing a beekeeper's veil and heavy leather gloves, came out carrying a straw skep or hive and placed it on the cart. Several bees were buzzing angrily around his head, and around the head of the young man, but both ignored them. Mara went quickly through the gate and turned to go up to the west door of the new church.'Giolla is taking his bees up to the mountain for a last feed of heather before the winter sets in,' said a familiar voice behind Mara.'Toin, how good to see you.' Mara turned and then hesitated. The customary thing would be to follow this by saying: 'you're looking well', but no one could say that of the figure sitting on a wooden bench beside the path; his hand was pressed to his side and his eyes were black with pain. She had heard that Toin the <i>briuga,</i> or hospitaller, was unwell, but she had not expected to see this level of deterioration in a man whom she had last seen hosting a cheerful crowd of merchants from Galway.'You're not well, Toin,' she said, going over to him. She was fond of Toin; they shared a love of gardening and in the early days of her garden he had given her many plants, but in her busy life she had not seen him for several months.He looks a dying man, thought Mara, eyeing with concern the <i>briuga'</i>s grey face.'It's good to see you, Brehon, come and sit by me for a minute.' His voice was still extraordinarily rich and full - a beautiful voice, Mara always thought - but his head was like a skull, the skin dry and bloodless and the brown eyes sunk deeply into their sockets. As always, he was richly dressed; but the clothes fluttered on his emaciated form like those on a scarecrow in a windswept field.'Can I do anything for you, assist you home perhaps?' He had been a neighbour and a close friend of Father David, but he certainly didn't look well enough to stay for the burial service and the funeral. Her words had hardly been spoken when she heard another voice.'Could you use a strong arm, Toin? I'm all finished here now; my son will take that lot up to the hills to feed from the heather and I'll just leave these last few skeps down here in the shelter of the wall. There aren't many bees in these ones and they will be best in the warmth.' The beekeeper Giolla approached, pulling off his hat with the veil still attached and placing his heavy gauntlets inside of it before he bowed courteously to Mara.'This is my friend, Giolla. He gives me a pot of honey every year,' said Toin with a wry smile. He was obviously very ill, but the habit of courtesy was still there.'Your guests must enjoy that.' Mara smiled at the old man, but she feared that the hospitaller would not entertain many more guests in this life.'I give a pot to those of my neighbours who have gardens and a swarm if they have a farm,' said Giolla sittingdown on the other side of the old man and looking at him with concern.'Ah, recompense for bee trespass!' said Mara. 'My scholars always find this very amusing when they learn the laws about it. They make up jokes about spotting Eoin MacNamara's bees in my garden and then serving a writ upon him. It always seems to amuse them and it's one thing that they never forget from their studies. Does everyone welcome the swarm? I'm not a lover of honey so wouldn't care for it myself.''I don't force it on anyone.' For some reason Giolla's open, pleasant face had grown dark with anger.'Giolla is upset because when he presented a swarm to our neighbour over there a few weeks ago,' explained Toin with a nod towards the figure of Sorley still earnestly talking to the bishop, 'well, the man picked up a shovel and thrust the skep into the fire in the courtyard.''What!' Mara was appalled.'And every one of the bees was burned to death,' said Giolla bitterly.'But why did he do that?'Giolla shrugged his shoulders. 'Well, I brought them along to him as he owns three farms. And he started screaming at me to take them away. He had a big party of men there. They'd all been out hunting and they were putting the hares on trestle tables in the courtyard when I arrived. Most of them were pretty drunk; they were swallowing down flagons of hot mead. They all started to laugh at him and he got furiously angry. He screamed at them that bee stings were dangerous for him. I put the straw skepon the table and he pushed it into the fire. Anyway, let's forget him. Can I do anything for you, Toin?''No, no, my servant has gone for my medicine. You should go, both of you. There's the first stroke of the bell. The church will be full today.''I'll just check on those last few skeps and make sure that the bees are settling down,' said Giolla bowing a farewell to Mara as she hastened towards the church.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The bees were everywhere that sunny autumn, thought Mara; even here in the church a few adventurous bees had flown through the open window shutters and landed briefly on the flower-bestrewn coffin in front of the altar. From her seat at the top of the church, Mara smiled. The deceased priest, Father David, had always been fond of the little creatures. It seemed fitting that the gentle old man should have had this fleeting visit in his last hour above the ground. She glanced around the church, wondering if anyone else had noticed the bees' swift descent, but heads were bent in prayer or whispering to a neighbour and no one met her smile. Most of the people were known to her, but she caught sight of a deformed man whom she had not seen before. She turned back to the altar; the bishop had finished his last prayer, six men of the parish came forward, shouldered the coffin, and walked slowly along the side aisle towards the south door. The sacristan scurried ahead, key in hand; this door, which led to the ruins of the earlier church of Rathborney, was always kept locked except when a coffin was carried through it towards the graveyard.Mara glanced around again. The custom was that the dead person's relatives were the first to follow the coffin, but Father David had only the people of the parish to mourn him. Probably Sorley Skerrett, silversmith and owner of the nearby Newtown Castle, the most important person in the parish, should be first, but he did not appear to be in the church. This was odd; surely he had not gone home once he had finished talking to the bishop. Bishop Mauritius O'Brien, cousin to the king, had a quick eye that would immediately notice his absence from the service. Sorley's plain-faced daughter, Una, was there in the front bench, as was his apprentice, Daire, and their guest, Ulick Burke, Lord of Clanrickard in the county of Galway, but Sorley, himself, was nowhere to be seen.Quietly Mara got to her feet. As the king's representative, responsible for law and order in the kingdom, there was no doubt that, although only present today because of her affection for Father David, she was the person of highest status in the church. As soon as she moved, others stood up also and began to form an orderly line behind her, filling the middle aisle of the little church.The key grated in the lock of the south door and the coffin bearers bent their heads in preparation for stepping through its low arch. The sacristan lifted the latch and then there was a pause. No one moved. Mara peered around the bulky form of the bishop. The sacristan's face was red as he put his weight behind the door and endeavoured to push it. Mara concealed a smile. No doubt, no one had thought of checking that the ancient door, part of the old ruined church, was still in working order. Perhaps it had swollen, or more likely, since the weather had been very dry, a giantstone had fallen from the old arch above it and had blocked it.'Excuse me, Brehon, ...</p><h2>Wyoming Christmas Ransom (Carsons &amp; Delaneys, 3)</h2><p><strong><em>A killer has been hiding for two years.<br><br>This Christmas, he&#x2019;s ready to finish what he started.</em></strong><br><br>He didn&#x2019;t need her to care, so why did Wyoming loner Will Cooper&#x2019;s world implode when Gracie Delaney quit helping him solve his estranged wife&#x2019;s murder?

She'd been craving him for weeks now. This man with the perfect male body, killer smile and eyes so green they didn't seem to be real. </i></p><p><i> Perfect lips that quirked up with a wicked charm.

Cleanup, aisle five." </p><p> Allison George jerked her head up from her book as she heard her name called over the intercom. It wasn't until the manager had repeated his command that she left her dream world completely. </p><p> Damn. She was just getting to the really good part. </p><p> It never failed. </p><p> Sighing, she flipped to the front of the book and looked wistfully at the advertisement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote> <i> <b>What's your fantasy?</b> <p> Do you ever dream of getting away from it all?

Had she ever dreamed of getting away? </p><p> Was Brendan about to give Robin the best sex of her life? </p><p> Was he primo fabuloso? </p><p> Of course she dreamed of getting away. Every minute of every day. Unfortunately, that seemed about as likely as Brendan stepping out of his book and making her his fantasy lover. </p><p> Or of a house landing on top of her evil floor manager during a tornado and putting him out of her misery. </p><p> And speaking of the devil, he was headed straight for her. Allison hid her novel behind her back as her manager came down the book aisle with a stern grimace on his face. At fifty-two with salt and pepper hair, Dan might have been attractive at some point, but the constant disdainful sneer robbed him of any appeal. </p><p> "Allison, there's a toddler who threw up on aisle five. Move your butt. We can't leave it there for someone to step in." He barely looked her way as he went past her. </p><p> Oh yeah, her life was just one great big bowl full of cherries. </p><p> If she was really lucky, maybe on her way home some uninsured driver would plow into her beat-up Dodge Neon and total it while leaving her completely hale and whole enough to walk back to work tomorrow and mop up more vomit. She sighed in disgust. </p><p> Wondering if she had just in fact conjured up another visit from the Bad Luck Fairy, Allison tucked the romance novel into her smock pocket. </p><p> For weeks now she'd been carrying it around, rereading the entry form and debating on whether or not she should enter. </p><p> But why bother? </p><p> No one like her ever won anything anyway. It was always some rich doctor or lawyer. Someone other than her. Someone who didn't really need the money or the break. </p><p> Still that tiny voice in her head kept saying, "Yeah, but maybe this once..." </p><p> She hated that voice. It had gotten her into plenty of trouble in her life. </p><p> Grabbing a broom and the special dry solution she needed to clean up the mess, Allison went to the aisle and tried not to think about just how much she truly hated her job. </p><p> As she worked, a small smile hovered at her lips. <i>Hey look, I'm already Cinderella. All they need to do is send me over to housewares with the fireplaces and have me clean those out and I'm in business.</i> </p><p> "Ally?" </p><p> She looked up and it took a full second for the voice to register. It was one she hadn't heard in way too long. </p><p> Margaret Dale. </p><p> The two of them had been best friends in high school. And in the ten years since they had graduated, Margaret hadn't changed a bit. </p><p> "Maggie May!" she exclaimed, using her old nickname for her friend. </p><p> The broom forgotten, Allison hugged her tight, grateful to see a friendly face again. "Good Lord, how long has it been?" </p><p> "Six or seven years, at least." </p><p> Allison's eyes teared up as she stepped back. Maggie's elegant blond hair was pulled back in a sleek ponytail. She wore a black pair of slacks and a chic, short-sleeved black sweater. But then Maggie had always looked like some fashion model walking away from a shoot. "You look fantastic!" </p><p> Maggie beamed, until she looked Allison up and down and then the smile faltered. Not in a condescending way, but in a way that said, "I'm sorry I got out and you got trapped in this godforsaken place." </p><p> Allison offered her a joking grin, even though a part of her was mortified at what she knew Maggie saw. </p><p> She stood in front of her elegant friend in her dark blue polyester smock, ill-fitting jeans and faded-out, oversized shirt. Worse, her own frizzy blond hair was in bad need of a trim and deep conditioning. Neither of which she could afford at the moment. </p><p> "I'm sorry about your mom," Margaret said quietly. "Had I known, I would have been here for the funeral." </p><p> Allison patted her arm as her throat tightened. She'd loved her mother more than anything. Ten years ago when she and Maggie had graduated high school, Maggie had gone to the University of Georgia, then moved off to New York after graduation to be an editor. Meanwhile, Allison had stayed home to help her mother, who was dying of cancer. For nine years her mother had fought hard and then last spring, she'd lost the war. </p><p> God, how she missed her. It was still a raw, aching pain inside her. Her mother had been everything to her. </p><p> "I know," she said, rubbing Maggie's arm. "I'm sorry. I didn't even think about sending word to you until after the funeral was over. I just wasn't in my right mind." </p><p> Maggie nodded in understanding. "You've been busy. My mom told me that you're engaged to Gary Mitchell. Congrats. I know how much you always loved him." </p><p> Allison drew a shaky breath as she thought about her rattlesnake ex. "Yeah," she said in an overly exaggerated tone. "Just l-o-v-e him to pieces." </p><p> "Uh-oh. That sounds ominous." </p><p> She sighed as she picked up the broom. "Well, I found the dog in bed a week ago with one of the strippers from the Night Owl." </p><p> Maggie's face showed the horror Allison had felt when she'd stumbled in late from work to find the two of them going at it in her bed. "No!" </p><p> "Oh yeah." </p><p> "What did you do?" </p><p> "I grabbed my broom, swept both pieces of trash out of my house, then I went through and decided it was time to do a little fall cleaning. I gathered up everything of his I could find, threw it into a pile on my front lawn and then proceeded to have a weenie roast. I'm told you could see the flames for up to a mile away." </p><p> Maggie laughed. "What did Gary do?" </p><p> "He called the cops and I spent the night in jail. But it was so worth it. I just wish I'd been able to get my shotgun loaded before the police got there and had had a chance to fill his backside with buckshot...." </p><p> "Allison? Are you on break?" </p><p> Allison cringed at Dan's voice coming from behind her. She looked around to see his soured frown. "I'm just helping a customer, Dan. She wanted to know where the lightbulbs were." </p><p> He didn't buy it for a minute. </p><p> Allison led Maggie away from his hearing. "Sorry, Maggie, I can't really talk right now." </p><p> Nodding, Maggie let her gaze dip down to the pocket of Allison's smock where the top of her book was peeking out. She smiled. <i>"Sugar and Spice</i> by Rachel Fire. You like it?" </p><p> "I love it. It's a great book." </p><p> Maggie's smile widened. "I edited it." </p><p> "You did not!" </p><p> "Yes, I did. She's one of the authors I discovered last year." Maggie tilted her head and looked back down the aisle to where Dan was still watching them.

He founded what is known today as the Alinsky ideology and Alinsky concepts of mass organization for power. His work in organizing the poor to fight for their rights as citizens has been internationally recognized. In the late 1930s he organized the Back of the Yards area in Chicago (the neighborhood made famous in Upton Sinclair&#39;s The Jungle). Subsequently, through the Industrial Areas Foundation which he began in 1940, Mr. Alinsky and his staff helped to organize communities not only in Chicago but throughout the country. He later turned his attentions to the middle class, creating a training institute for organizers. He died in 1972.</p><h2>Moon Tiger</h2><p>The last thoughts of a dying writer are captured in this intelligent novel byBooker Prize-winner Penelope Lively.

Penelope Lively lives in London.Lively recently won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for this deeply moving, elegantly structured novel. The heroine is Claudia Hampton, an unconventional historian and former war correspondent who lies in a hospital bed dying of cancer. Forced inward, Claudia moves randomly across time and place to reconstruct the strata of her life. But "most lives have their core, their kernel, the vital centre"; Claudia's is the brief, tragic encounter she had in Egypt during the war with Tom Southern, a British tank officer on leave from battle. Tom's voice, along with those of her brother and daughter, joins Claudia's to shape a narrative that is a complex, intricately composed fugue. This haunting evocation of loss is Lively's finest achievement yet.Laurence Hull, Cannon Memorial Lib., Concord, N.C.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Revolving Door of Life (44 Scotland Street) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2012] NA</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Moving Can Be Good For You<br><br>Matthew had read somewhere&#x2014;in one of those hoary lists with which newspapers and magazines fill their columns on quiet days&#x2014;that moving house was one of the most stressful of life&#x2019;s experiences&#x2014;even if not quite as disturbing as being the victim of an armed robbery or being elected president, nemine contradicente, of an unstable South American republic. Matthew faced no such threats, of course, but he nevertheless found the prospect of leaving India Street for the sylvan surroundings of Nine Mile Burn extremely worrying. And it made no difference that Nine Mile Burn was, as the name suggested, only nine miles from the centre of Edinburgh.<br><br>&#x201c;What really worries me,&#x201d; he confessed to Elspeth, &#x201c;is the whole business of selling India Street. What if nobody wants to buy this flat? What then?&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at her with unconcealed anxiety: he could imagine what it was like not to be able to sell one&#x2019;s house. He had recently been at a party at which somebody had whispered pityingly of another guest: &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t sell his flat, you know.&#x201d; He had looked across the room at the poor unfortunate of whom the remark was made and had seen a hodden-doon, depressed figure, visibly bent under the burden of unshiftable equity. That, he decided, was how people who couldn&#x2019;t sell their house looked&#x2014;shadowy figures, wraiths, as dejected and without hope as the damned in Dante&#x2019;s Inferno, haunted by the absence of offers for an unmoveable property. He had shuddered at the thought and reflected on his good fortune at not being in that position himself. Yet here he was deliberately courting it . . .<br><br>Elspeth&#x2019;s attitude was more sanguine. She had been unruffled by their previous moves&#x2014;from India Street to Moray Place, and then back again to India Street. The prospect of another flit&#x2014;a Scots word that implies an attempt to evade the clutches of creditors suggests, misleadingly, that moving is an airy, inconsequential thing&#x2014;did not seem to trouble her, and she had no concerns about the sale of the flat. &#x201c;But of course somebody will want to buy it,&#x201d; she reassured him. &#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t they? It&#x2019;s one of the nicest flats in the street. It&#x2019;s got plenty of room and bags of light. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to live in the middle of the Edinburgh New Town?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew frowned. &#x201c;The New Town isn&#x2019;t for everybody,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not everybody finds the Georgian aesthetic pleasing.&#x201d; He paused as he tried to think of a single person he knew of whom this was true. &#x201c;There are plenty of people these days who are suburban rather than urban. People who like to have . . .&#x201d; He paused for thought. He knew nobody like this, but they had to exist. &#x201c;Who like to have garages. <i>Homo suburbiensis</i>. Morningside man, who is a bit like Essex man but just a touch . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Superior?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said it; I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Elspeth smiled. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t worry so much, Matt, darlingest. And so what if we don&#x2019;t sell it? We can afford the other place anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew winced. &#x201c;If I dip into capital,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Elspeth shrugged. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t money for spending? And surely there&#x2019;s enough there to be dipped into.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew knew that she was right; at the last valuation, his portfolio of shares in the astute care of the Adam Bank had shot up and he could have bought the new house several times over if necessary. But Matthew had been imbued by his father with exactly that sense of caution that had created the fund in the first place, and the idea of selling shares in any but the direst of emergencies was anathema to him.<br><br>In general, Elspeth did not look too closely at Matthew&#x2019;s financial affairs. She had never been much interested in money, and very rarely spent any on anything but family essentials and the occasional outfit or pair of shoes. She was nonetheless aware of their good fortune and of the fact that thanks to the generosity of Matthew&#x2019;s businessman father they were spared the financial anxieties that affected most people. Her capacity for moral imagination, though, was such that she could understand the distorting effect that poverty had on any life, and she had never been, nor ever would become, indifferent to the lot of those&#x2014;perhaps a majority of the population of Scotland&#x2014;who were left with relatively little disposable income after the payment of monthly bills. This attitude was shared by Matthew, with the result that they were tactful about their situation&#x2014;and generous too, when generosity was required. <br><br>The farmhouse near Nine Mile Burn had not been cheap. Although it was far enough from Edinburgh to avoid the high prices of the capital, it was close enough to be more expensive than houses in West Linton, a village that lay only a few miles further down the road. Their house, which they had agreed to buy from no less a person than the Duke of Johannesburg, who lived at Single Malt House not far away, had been valued at seven hundred thousand pounds. For that they got six bedrooms in the main house&#x2014;along with a study, a gun room (Matthew did not have a gun, of course), and a drawing room with a good view of both the Lammermuir and Moorfoot Hills to the south and east; a tractor shed, a byre, and six acres of ground.<br><br>The Duke had been pleased that Matthew was the purchaser; they had met on several occasions before, although the Duke seemed to have only the vaguest idea of who Matthew was. Matthew&#x2019;s quiet demeanour, however, had been enough to endear him to the Duke.<br><br>&#x201c;I must say,&#x201d; the Duke had remarked to a friend, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a great relief to have found somebody who&#x2019;s not in the slightest bit <i>shouty</i>. You know what I mean? Those shouty people one meets these days&#x2014;all very full of themselves and brash. We used to have very few of them in Scotland, you know; now they&#x2019;re on the rise, it seems.&#x201d;<br><br>The friend knew exactly what the Duke meant. &#x201c;Nouveau riche,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re flashy&#x2014;they throw their money around.&#x201d;<br><br>The Duke nodded. &#x201c;Whereas I&#x2019;m <i>nouveau pauvre</i>. I&#x2019;ve got barely a sou these days, you know&#x2014;not that I ever had very much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you a duke,&#x201d; said the friend. &#x201c;Fancy that!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, a sort of duke,&#x201d; conceded the Duke. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in any of the stud books, you know: Debrett&#x2019;s and so on. Or I&#x2019;m in one of them&#x2014;just&#x2014;but I gather it&#x2019;s not a very reliable one. It was rather expensive to get in; you had to buy sixty copies, as I recall, and I think quite a number of people in it are a bit on the ropey side. In fact, all of them are, I believe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People take you at your own evaluation, I&#x2019;ve always thought,&#x201d; said the friend. &#x201c;Behave like a duke and they&#x2019;ll swallow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; said the Duke. &#x201c;But frankly, that&#x2019;s a bit difficult for me, old man. I&#x2019;m not quite sure what the form is when it comes to being a pukka duke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take a look at some of the people who are what they claim to be,&#x201d; advised the friend. &#x201c;Watch the way they stand; the way they walk. They&#x2019;re very sure-footed, I&#x2019;m told. And they look down at the ground a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because they own it,&#x201d; said the Duke. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t apply to me&#x2014;or not very much. I&#x2019;ve got fifty-eight acres in Midlothian and forty-one up in Lochaber, but most of it is pretty scrubby. Lots of broom and rhododendrons.&#x201d;<br><br>The friend looked thoughtful. &#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re not quite the real thing, I suppose. And then there&#x2019;s always the risk that the Lord Lyon will catch up with you.&#x201d;<br><br>The mention of the Lord Lyon made the Duke blanch. This was the King of Arms, the official who supervised all matters of heraldry and succession in Scotland. He had extensive legal powers and could prosecute people for the unauthorised use of coats of arms and the like.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think Lyon would ever bother about me?&#x201d; asked the Duke nervously.<br><br>His friend looked out of the window. &#x201c;You never know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I shouldn&#x2019;t like to be in your shoes if he did.&#x201d;<br><br>It was not the sort of thing a friend should say&#x2014;or at least not the sort of thing that a reassuring friend should say.<br>2. Distressed Furniture<br><br>The Duke of Johannesburg proved to be a most considerate seller, more than prepared to include all the contents of the house in the sale without adding anything to the purchase price.<br><br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t lived in the place for years,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And recently we let it out, of course. But all the stuff is ours, and some of it is actually quite good, even if it&#x2019;s a bit distressed, as the antique dealers say. Mind you, <i>distressed</i> is not quite strong enough for some of my furniture. My furniture has moved beyond being distressed. <i>Terminal </i>might be more accurate. I can just imagine the auction catalogues&#x2014;can&#x2019;t you?&#x2014;&#x2018;a table in terminal condition&#x2019; and so on. Hah!&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew was keen to keep as much of the Duke&#x2019;s furniture as possible, but Elspeth had other ideas. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s terrible old rubbish,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Look at this.&#x201d; She referred to the inventory that the Duke&#x2019;s agent had prepared. &#x201c;<i>A charming William IV library table with only two legs, but otherwise sound</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I saw that one,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;It had a lovely green leather top.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s as may be,&#x201d; Elspeth retorted, &#x201c;but what&#x2019;s the use of a table with two legs? Or . . .&#x201d; And here she pointed to another inventory item. &#x201c;<i>A glass-fronted bookcase, circa 1860; no glass</i>.&#x201d; <br><br>She looked up at Matthew. &#x201c;What is the point, may I ask, of having a glass-fronted bookcase with no glass in the front? In fact, one might even go so far as to say that it&#x2019;s an impossibility. A glass-fronted bookcase with no glass is simply not a glass-fronted bookcase.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re intent on being pedantic.&#x201d;<br><br>They normally did not argue with one another, but even the most equable of couples may be expected to fall out over a move. And so Matthew decided at a very early stage that he would leave everything up to Elspeth and not dispute any of her decisions. Armed with this authority, Elspeth made all the arrangements, chose the date of departure, and did most of the packing herself. He helped, of course, mostly by taking the triplets around the Botanic Gardens in their three-seated pushchair. This inevitably brought a response from passersby&#x2014;looks that ranged from amusement to sympathy and sometimes on to disapproval.<br><br>&#x201c;Three!&#x201d; remarked one elderly woman as Matthew and the triplets passed her on the way to the greenhouse. &#x201c;My, you must have been insatiable!&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew was ready to let this remark pass with a polite nod of his head, but then its implications dawned on him. Did she really think <i>that</i>? he asked himself. <br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I wonder what you mean by what you&#x2019;ve just said.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman blushed. &#x201c;Oh . . . oh, I don&#x2019;t really know. It&#x2019;s just that it must take a lot of energy to create triplets. Not every man . . . Oh dear, I&#x2019;m not sure that I know what I meant.&#x201d;<br><br>And then there was the visiting American woman who asked the triplets&#x2019; names when they were waiting together for a pedestrian light in Stockbridge. &#x201c;Dear little things,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all boys, aren&#x2019;t they? What are they called?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tobermory, Rognvald and Fergus,&#x201d; answered the proud father.<br><br>&#x201c;What wonderful Scottish names!&#x201d; enthused the visitor. &#x201c;Which is Tobermory?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew hesitated. The truth was that he did not know, as although Elspeth claimed to be able to differentiate between the three boys, he had no idea. But a father could hardly confess to being uncertain as to the identity of his own sons, and so he pointed at random to one of the boys. &#x201c;Him,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The woman bent forward to look more closely. &#x201c;We went to Tobermory last week,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We were visiting Iona and afterwards we called in at Tobermory&#x2014;a lovely place . . .&#x201d; Her voice trailed away. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s wearing his brother&#x2019;s jumper, I see. It has Fergus knitted across the front.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew waved airily. &#x201c;They share their clothes,&#x201d; he said airily. &#x201c;And of course they&#x2019;re far too young to dress themselves, or to care what they&#x2019;re wearing, for that matter.&#x201d;<br><br>In the last few days before the move, the boys were left in the care of Anna, their Danish au pair, while Matthew and Elspeth made final preparations. A couple of weeks before they were due to move in, the Duke agreed to meet them at the house to hand over the keys&#x2014;they had already paid the purchase price&#x2014;and to answer any final queries they might have. <br><br>&#x201c;I shall miss the old place,&#x201d; he said, as he stood with them in the doorway of the large ground-floor drawing room. &#x201c;We used to have such marvellous parties here back in the old days. White-tie affairs, you know. The men in Highland dress, of course, and the women in long dresses with tartan sashes. Interminable affairs, some thought, but I always enjoyed them. We used to give breakfast to anybody who was still there at six in the morning, and standing. Sometimes we even had to give them lunch. Frightful, but there we are&#x2014;it&#x2019;s very hard to ask guests to leave, you know. Some stayed for weeks.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;I never really knew how to do it until I read about what Willie Maugham said to Paddy Leigh Fermor after Paddy had for some reason been terribly rude to the old boy when he was staying as a guest at the Villa Mauresque. For some reason Paddy imitated Maugham&#x2019;s stutter at the dinner table&#x2014;causing dreadful offence. One doesn&#x2019;t imitate the host&#x2019;s stutter in any circumstances. Anyway, Paddy did and so Maugham said to him over coffee that night, &#x2018;I shall have to say goodbye to you at this stage as when I get up tomorrow morning you will already have left.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The Duke laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;How very tactful,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;I never met Maugham, of course,&#x201d; continued the Duke. &#x201c;He was more my father&#x2019;s generation. In fact, Pa met him once or twice in Antibes. He said he was an ill-tempered old cove, but there we are. Leigh Fermor shouldn&#x2019;t have done what he did.&#x201d;<br><br>The Duke gazed fondly over the drawing room. &#x201c;Yes, those white-tie parties were grand evenings, and people paid attention to what they wore. You can&#x2019;t just add a white tie to Highland Dress, you know. It all depends where you are. If you&#x2019;re in Perthshire, for example, you can only wear a white tie with Highland Dress if you were born in the county. In Argyll, if the invitation says white tie&#x2014;and it does for occasions like the Oban gathering&#x2014;you wear a jabot, as I&#x2019;m sure you know.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew was silent. He knew nothing about any of this and he wondered why nobody had ever taught him about these things that were so important even while being utterly unimportant.</p><h2>Nimisha&#39;s Ship</h2><p>When it comes to sheer imagination and storytelling prowess, Anne McCaffrey is in a class by herself. Few writers have created characters more deeply loved or futures more intensely lived. For more than thirty years, she has reigned as one of the premier talents in science fiction and fantasy, flying above the crowd on the glittering wings of such masterworks as The Dragonriders of Pern and Crystal Singer. Now, McCaffrey soars to dizzying unscaled heights in an exciting new world bursting with adventure and romance . . .<br><br>On Vega III, where the jaded inhabitants pursue lives of malicious intrigue and decadent pleasure, Lady Nimisha Boynton-Rondymense has always been an anomaly. Disdainful of the frivolity of her fellows, she prefers the exciting and challenging world of her father, Lord Tionel, owner and principal starship designer of the famous Rondymense shipyards.<br><br>Precociously gifted, Nimisha becomes Lord Tionel's secret assistant--and, in the aftermath of a shocking tragedy, his chosen successor at the helm of the shipyards. But supplanting her father's designated body-heir, the callow Lord Vestrin, is a slight that Vestrin and his mother, Lady Vescuya, will not easily forget. Or forgive. <br><br>Preoccupied with carrying on her father's ambitious plans for the Mark 5, an experimental long-distance cruiser, Nimisha dangerously disregards Vestrin's animosity--until a&nbsp;&nbsp;solo test flight of the Mark 5 goes horribly awry, marooning Nimisha light-years from home on a planet as deadly as it is beautiful. <br><br>Now, Vestrin and Vescuya are given the chance they've been waiting for: to reclaim the shipyards . . . by any means necessary. Only Nimisha's child, Cuiva--a girl every bit as ingenious as her mother--stands in their way. But for how long? For just when her daughter needs her most, Nimisha is unable to help--and in a precarious situation herself. But Nimisha has never given up in her life--and she's not about to start now . . .</p><p>Parts of <i>Nimisha's Ship</i> are reminiscent of the melodramatic intrigue and romance among lords and ladies in Anne McCaffrey's first SF novel, <i>Restoree</i> (1967). Here, though, danger and drama are downplayed while the course of true love--plus the joy of friendship--moves to center stage. Nimisha, heir to her mother's wealth and high status, tomboyishly prefers the spaceship yards of her absentee father. She sneaks off to work with him and emerges as a gifted ship designer. One day, testing a splendid new space-yacht, she falls through a wormhole to a far-off region of the galaxy. This contains a planet of unfriendly beasties--mostly leathery-winged avians, easily shot down by Nimisha's yacht AI--and stranded wormhole victims: a haggard human party easily put right by medical treatment, and midget aliens who are easily befriended. Romance soon blooms for Nimisha, and she settles down to have the nicest human castaway's babies (twins, then triplets). Meanwhile, rescue missions are on the way, one by the long, slow route and one by accidental wormhole encounter. Happy family reunions follow, with a certain twinkly charm but no real suspense or surprise. It's a comforting, unthreatening read: McCaffrey addicts will love it, but newcomers may prefer to start with her tougher, grittier SF adventures like the classic <i>Dragonflight</i>. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i><br>Praise for Anne McCaffrey<br><br>"Few are better at mixing elements of high fantasy and hard science fiction."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"[McCaffrey is] a master of the well-told tale."<br>--Chicago Sun-Times</p><h2>The Fun of the Fifties: Ads, Fads and Fashion</h2><p>The 1950s was a time of Bakelite phones, Sooty puppets, little blue waxed paper twists of salt in packets of crisps, Spangles, and black-and-white television sets. With the birth of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, a spirit of post-War camaraderie, the end of rationing, the Festival of Britain, and the Coronation, this was an optimistic and more innocent time. Jam-packed with wonderful color photographs of everything from toys and household items to fashion, food, and film posters, and from the magazines and comics to the television programs, this wonderful collection celebrates one of the UK&#x2019;s most vibrant and celebrated decades. This toast to the 1950s is written and compiled by the Founder and Curator of the Museum of Brands, Robert Opie. This fascinating and hugely popular museum is a time tunnel of more than 12,000 original items reflecting the history of consumer culture. This celebration of one of the most memorable eras will take all those baby-boomers back to days of 1950s childhood innocence that should never be forgotten.</p><p><b>Robert Opie</b> worked for 16 years in market research before opening the first museum devoted to the history of packaging and advertising in Gloucester in 1984. In 2005 he opened The Museum of Brands in London. His research has focused on the history of supermarket brands, and after writing some 20 books and appearing on endless television and radio programs, he has become a leading authority on the subject.</p><h2>The Emerging Democratic Majority (Lisa Drew Books)</h2><p>Forecasts a progressive era which is indicated by a rise of a diverse post-industrial society and offers opinions on such topics as health care and the environment.</p><p><b>John B. Judis</b> is a senior editor of <i>The New Republic</i> and author of <i>William F Buckley, Jr.</i> and <i>The Paradox of American Democracy: Elites, Special Interests, and the Betrayal of Public Trust.</i><b>Chapter One: The Rise and Fall of the Conservative Republican Majority</b><br><br>In 1969, a year after Richard Nixon won the presidency, Kevin Phillips, an aide to Attorney General John Mitchell, published a book entitled <i>The Emerging Republican Majority.</i> The apparent confirmation of its thesis in 1972 -- not to mention Phillips's proximity to the administration -- eventually landed it on the best-seller lists.<br><br>Like other books of its kind, however, it was cited more often than it was read, and its actual thesis has been clouded by its notoriety. Phillips did not argue that Republicans had already created a majority -- in fact, when he wrote his book, Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress, plus the majority of statehouses. What he argued was that the era of "New Deal Democratic hegemony" was over. Phillips predicted that a new Republican majority would eventually emerge out of popular disillusionment with big government programs and the collapse of the Democratic coalition -- a collapse the 1968 candidacy of Alabama governor George Wallace had foreshadowed. And a Republican majority finally did emerge in 1980, but only after the GOP had rebounded from the Watergate scandal.<br><br>Our view is that we are at a similar juncture -- but one that will yield the opposite result. We believe that the Republican era Phillips presciently perceived in 1969 is now over. We are witnessing the "end of Republican hegemony." The first signs appeared in the early 1990s -- not merely in Bill Clinton's victory in 1992, but in H. Ross Perot's third-party candidacy and the rise of new kinds of independent voters. The Republican takeover of Congress in November 1994 seemed to show that Clinton's win and Perot's strong showing were flukes. Indeed, many confidently predicted that 1994 heralded the beginning of still another conservative realignment. But the 1994 Republican wins turned out, in retrospect, to be the same kind of false dawn that the Democrats had experienced twenty years earlier because of Watergate.<br><br>Ever since 1994, Republicans have lost ground in Congress and in the country. Like the Democrats of the 1970s, they have also begun to suffer serious divisions within their ranks -- from Pat Buchanan on the right to John McCain and Jim Jeffords on the left. Bush's aggressive prosecution of the war against the terrorists in the fall of 2001 lifted him in public esteem and may have delayed a Republican collapse in 2002. But once the clouds of war lift, and Americans cease to focus on threats to their national security, Republicans are likely to continue their slide, and the movement toward a Democratic majority is likely to resume.<br><br>The Republican majority that Phillips foresaw represented a "realignment" of American politics. A realignment entails a shift in the political coalitions that dominate American politics and in the worldview through which citizens interpret events and make political judgments. Realignments happened before in 1860-64, 1896, and 1932-36. These past realignments followed or took place during cataclysmic events -- the conflict over slavery and the Civil War, the depression of the 1890s, and the Great Depression of the 1930s -- that polarized the country along either regional or class lines. No similar cataclysm has shaken the political system since then, and as a result, realignments have occurred more gradually, with the fall of a prior majority and the rise of a new one separated by a decade-long transition period. It took from 1968 to 1980 for the New Deal majority to collapse and for a new conservative Republican majority to be born; and it is taking from 1992 until sometime in this decade for the conservative Republican majority to disintegrate and for a new Democratic majority to emerge.<br><br>I. HOW REALIGNMENTS WORK<br><br>Political scientist Walter Dean Burnham called realignments America's "surrogate for revolution." It is a good way to think of them. Realignments respond to the sharp clashes between interests, classes, regions, religions, and ethnic groups brought about by tectonic shifts in the economy and society. In other countries, these conflicts might have led to insurrection and revolution, but with the exception of our Civil War, in the United States they have resulted in changes in party control and the emergence of a new political zeitgeist. The tensions that industrialization stirred within a peasant economy contributed to the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, but in the United States similar tensions produced the Populist Party, its absorption within the Democratic Party, and eventually the triumph of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt's new Republican coalition, which dominated American politics (with a brief interregnum) from 1896 to 1930. The economic collapse of the 1920s propelled the Fascists to power in Italy and the Nazis in Germany. In the United States, by contrast, the crash of 1929 simply ushered one governing coalition -- Herbert Hoover's Republicans -- out of power, so that another -- Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal Democrats -- could take over.<br><br>Realignments take place because a dominant political coalition fails to adapt to or to contain a growing social and political conflict. A political movement like the Southern civil rights movement can precipitate this sort of conflict. So can differing political responses to major changes in the country's economy or position in the world. The Jacksonian Democrats' rise in the 1820s was partly the result of conflict between the farmers of the new frontier states, who demanded easy credit, and Eastern bankers and merchants who wanted the stability of the Second Bank of the United States. The Republican Party was born in 1856 out of the conflict between the free-labor North and the plantation South over the extension of slavery. The McKinley Republicans put the United States squarely on the side of its industrial future rather than its agrarian past. And the New Deal Democrats expanded the scope and responsibilities of the federal government to overcome the inability of modern capitalism, acting on its own, to prevent poverty, unemployment, and incendiary class conflict.<br><br>In each realignment, the emerging majority party creates a new coalition by winning over voters from its rival party and by increasing its sway over its own voters, whose ranks have typically increased through birth, immigration, and economic change. In 1896, the Republicans won over Northern workingmen who had voted Democratic in the past, but who blamed the Democrats for the depression and were turned off by presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan's agrarian appeal for free silver. The addition of these voters gave the Republicans a solid majority in the North and the Far West. And that majority held until 1932, when anger over the Great Depression drove a number of groups -- industrial workers, small farmers, blacks, Catholics, and Jews -- back into the Democratic Party. Together with the party's existing base in the South, this coalition gave the Democrats an enduring majority, reducing Republicans to their loyal business supporters in the Northeast and Midwest, farmers in the Western plains states, and rural Protestants in the Midwest and Northeast.<br><br>Majority coalitions are not necessarily homogeneous. They are like old cities that are periodically rebuilt. They may be recognizable by their newest buildings and streets, but they also contain older structures and streets. Similarly, a new majority coalition is distinguished by a set of leading constituencies, but also includes other groups that have traditionally supported that party and still find more reasons to support it than the opposition. At the heart of the New Deal were Franklin Roosevelt, New York senator Robert Wagner (the author of the National Labor Relations and Social Security Acts), and trade unionists like the Clothing Workers president Sidney Hillman, but it also included white Southern conservatives who had voted Democratic since before the Civil War and were typified by Roosevelt's first vice president, Texan John Nance Garner.<br><br>Realignments have been accompanied by the creation of a new dominant political worldview or zeitgeist. Like the coalition itself, a worldview is made up of heterogeneous elements, but it also has a leading set of ideas. The leading New Deal Democrats -- Franklin Roosevelt rather than Garner or brain truster Rexford Tugwell rather than brain-truster-turned-critic Raymond Moley -- held a far wider view of government's economic responsibility -- and of what government could do -- than did the Coolidge-Hoover Republicans. A Republican of the 1920s could not have conceived of, let alone condoned, the federal government paying the unemployed to go to school or to paint a mural. The New Deal Democrats also took a far more favorable view of labor unions and a far more skeptical view of business than did contemporary Republicans. But of course not all Democrats who voted for Roosevelt subscribed to these ideas about unions and government, just as, later, not all Republicans who voted for Reagan would support his ideas about banning abortion or reinstituting school prayer.<br><br>There is, finally, a kind of metaworldview that has distinguished the two parties. From Andrew Jackson through Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, Democrats have defined themselves as the party of the average American and Republicans as the party of the wealthy and powerful. The Democrats have not necessarily stigmatized the rich and powerful, but they have insisted that their priorities lie elsewhere. The Whigs and their successor, the Republicans, have been more consistently sympathetic to business and the wealthy. They have not defined themselves solely as the party of business, but they have defined America's interests as identical to those of its business class. Even when they have appeared to cast their lot rhetorically with the average American, as Reagan or former congressman Jack Kemp did, they have done so in a way that identifies the worker with the executive and the member of the middle class with the member of the upper class. They have shunned any evocation of class conflict or class resentment. <br><br>One indication that a realignment is imminent has been the rise of third parties that defy the existing political consensus. The Liberty and Free Soil parties of the 1840s arose because both the Democrats and the Whigs were unwilling to oppose slavery. The Progressive Party of 1924, which ran Robert La Follette for president and received a respectable 16.6 percent of the vote, pointed to rising disillusionment by farmers and industrial workers with the two major parties' support for laissez-faire economics. And in 1968, Wallace's third party arose because neither the Democratic nor the Republican leadership were willing to oppose the civil rights movement. Sometimes, the revolt against the prevailing worldview occurs within the opposition party itself. In 1928, Al Smith, a "wet," a Catholic, and an advocate of liberal reform, challenged the prevailing consensus; Barry Goldwater did so in 1964; and George McGovern in 1972. The opposition gets clobbered, but it does surprisingly well among constituencies that would become the heart of a new majority. Smith was routed by Hoover nationally, but he ran unusually strongly among urban Catholic voters, who had deserted the Democrats in 1896, but would return in the 1930s. Goldwater was also routed, but he created a new Republican base in the Deep South. And McGovern, as we shall soon see, tapped into the source of a future Democratic majority -- one just coming into view now.<br><br>Realignments used to occur every thirty-two to forty years. By this count, a realignment should have occurred between 1968 and 1976. But the realignment cycle coincided with the business cycle. Both the realignments of 1896 and 1932 were precipitated by depressions. After World War II, Keynesian fiscal policy didn't eliminate, but did reduce, the downward trajectory of the business cycle. And by eliminating massive depressions, it made it less likely that political realignments would occur exactly on time and as dramatically as before. That didn't lead to the end of realignments, but to a transitional period between the end of one majority and the beginning of another. This transition period created illusions of party dealignment and permanent equilibrium, but finally culminated in a new majority. The realignment of 1980 was prefaced by a twelve-year transition in which the old Democratic majority splintered, and the coming realignment is being preceded by a period of transition that began in 1992 in which the Republican majority has disintegrated.<br><br>II. THE COLLAPSE OF NEW DEAL LIBERALISM<br><br>In the sixties, two clear signs that a conservative Republican realignment might be imminent were Goldwater's nomination in 1964 and Wallace's independent campaign in 1968. In 1964, Goldwater directly challenged the New Deal and Cold War worldview that had united Republicans like Nixon and New York governor Nelson Rockefeller with Democrats like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. The Arizonan and his conservative supporters opposed the New Deal welfare state, including social security and the minimum wage; they favored the rollback rather than containment of Soviet communism; and they rejected a commitment to racial equality, even opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that guaranteed blacks equal access to public facilities. In the election, Goldwater was routed in the North and the West, but carried five Deep South states that had not backed the Republicans since Reconstruction (see chart). County by county, the pro-Republican shifts were phenomenal. For example, the average county in Mississippi moved Republican by an amazing 67 percentage points in 1964, while the average Louisiana county increased its Republican support by 34 points over 1960. These Deep South states would become bulwarks of the new conservative Republican majority.<br><br>In the 1964 Democratic presidential primaries and running as an independent candidate in 1968, Wallace challenged the consensus of both parties even more brazenly by advocating racial segregation. He waged an openly racist campaign that appealed to white Democrats who had been alienated by the civil rights movement and by the ghetto riots, which had begun in 1964. Wallace linked race to a cluster of concerns about the welfare state, taxes, spending, crime, local political power (blacks had already run for mayor in Cleveland and Gary), and the power of the federal government. This explosive cluster of issues, which had opposition to civil rights at its core, split the New Deal Democratic coalition. Phillips described this process in <i>The Emerging Republican Majority:</i><br><br>The principal force which broke up the Democratic (New Deal) coalition is the Negro socioeconomic revolution and liberal Democratic ideological inability to cope with it. Democratic "Great Society" programs aligned that party with many Negro demands, but the party was unable to defuse the racial tension sundering the nation. The South, the West, and the Catholic sidewalks of New York were the focus points of conservative opposition to the welfare liberalism of the federal government; however, the general opposition...came in large part from prospering Democrats who objected to Washington dissipating their tax dollars on programs which did them no good. The Democratic Party fell victim to the ideological impetus of a liberalism which had carried it beyond programs taxing the few for the benefit of the many...to programs taxing the many on behalf of the few.<br><br>In the 1968 election, Wallace got 13.5 percent of the vote nationally, and forty-six electoral votes from five states in the Deep South. In twenty-four additional states, he got more votes t...</p><h2>Hiss and Hers (Agatha Raisin)</h2><p><p>If only the bossy, beloved Agatha Raisin were as lucky at finding the right man as she is at catching killers in M.

Pascal said the shape of her nose changed the history of the world. Shakespeare portrayed her as an icon of tragic love. But who was Cleopatra, really?<p>Cleopatra was the last ruler of the Macedonian dynasty of Ptolemies. Highly intelligent, she spoke many languages and was rumored to be the only Ptolemy to read and speak Egyptian. Her famous liaisons with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony had as much to do with politics as the heart. Ruthless in dealing with her enemies, many within her own family, Cleopatra steered her kingdom through difficult times, and very nearly succeeded in creating an eastern empire to rival the growing might of Rome.</p><p>Her story was well documented by her near contemporaries, and the tragic tale of contrasts and oppositions the seductive but failing power of ancient Egypt versus the virile strength of modern Rome is so familiar we almost feel that we know Cleopatra. But our picture is highly distorted. Cleopatra is often portrayed as a woman ruled by emotion rather than reason; a queen hurtling towards inevitable self-destruction. But these tales of seduction, intrigue, and suicide by asp have obfuscated Cleopatra's true political genius.</p><p>Stripping away our preconceptions, many of them as old as Egypt's Roman conquerors, Egyptologist Joyce Tyldesley offers a magnificent biography of a most extraordinary queen.</p></p><p><b>Joyce Tyldesley, Ph.D.</b>, holds a first class honors degree in archaeology from Liverpool University and a doctorate from Oxford University.

This entertaining biography hits the elusive sweet spot between scholarship and readability. British archeologist Tyldesley (<i>Daughters of Isis</i>) is charmingly transparent about the unreliability of her sources. She tells us that when the Roman poet Lucan describes Cleopatra's ineffable night of shame with Julius Caesar, he is writing the equivalent of modern tabloid journalism. In spite of the lack of eyewitness descriptions of Cleopatra, the question, for instance, of what she looked like becomes a fast-moving amusing discussion of statuary as royal propaganda, the modern perception of Cleopatra's nose as way too big and the difference between beauty and sexiness. Writing with an easy mastery of her subject, Tyldesley always seems to be able to lay her hands on the perfect lively detail, whether an excerpt from an obscure bureaucratic document or a description of a kind of giant robot that paraded through the streets of Alexandria pouring libations of milk from a gold bottle. Though she makes it clear we'll never know what Cleopatra was really like, Tyldesley provides a memorable journey through the rich and contradictory sources of our knowledge about her. 8 pages of illus., 3 maps. <i>(Sept.)</i> ""<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book is his quest to understand everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill Bryson&#39;s challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn&#39;t some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science. It&#39;s not so much about what we know, as about how we know what we know. How do we know what is in the centre of the Earth, or what a black hole is, or where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out? On his travels through time and space, he encounters a splendid collection of astonishingly eccentric, competitive, obsessive and foolish scientists, like the painfully shy Henry Cavendish who worked out many conundrums like how much the Earth weighed, but never bothered to tell anybody about many of his findings. In the company of such extraordinary people, Bill Bryson takes us with him on the ultimate eye-opening journey, and reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.</p><p></p><h2>Afterzen: Experiences of a Zen Student Out on His Ear</h2><p>Offers a humorous look at one man&#39;s life as a seeker of knowledge and understanding, and can provide readers with deeper understanding of Zen philosophy</p><p><p><b>Janwillem van de Wetering</b> lives with his wife on the rocky coast of Northern Maine where he writes, paints, and composes typically unusual sculptures.</p>Nearly 30 years ago, van de Wetering, who would later achieve fame as a mystery novelist, published The Empty Mirror, about his experiences at a Zen monastery in Japan in the mid-60s. In 1975, he published a sequel, A Glimpse of Nothingness, about his stint at the Moon Springs Hermitage in Maine. Now the author has written a follow-up, AfterZen, told from the perspective of an aging soul who dropped most formal Zen practice years ago but still carries an abiding respect for the gut truths of the teaching and for at least some of its teachers. Much of the book has the air of the classic Zen saying, "If you see the Buddha on the road, kill him": with humor and occasional crankiness, van de Wetering knocks koans, meditation and some of the trappings of the monastic Zen life. There are many flashbacks, to Japan, to his American experiences, to meetings with fellow ex-students, and the book has a somewhat chaotic feel, rather more like life than art. Throughout, van de Wetering's voice is sincere, if iconoclastic.

For centuries, the sudden disappearance of this proud and noble people has baffled historians. Summoned to a dark desert plateau by a desperate letter form an old friend, renowned investigator Mike Raglan is drawn into a world of mystery, violence, and explosive revaltion. Crossing the border beyond the laws of man and nature, he will learn the astonishing legacy of the Anasazi -- but not without a price. Set in the contemporary Southwest, <i>The Haunted Mesa</i> draws on Louis L'Amour's extensive knowledge of Indian lore and mysticism. In this extraordinary book L'Amour tells a tale of epic adventure that takes his readers across the most extraordinary frontier they have ever encountered.Louis L&#x2019;Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of all time. He is the only American-born author in history to receive both the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his life's work. He has published ninety novels; twenty-seven short-story collections; two works of nonfiction; a memoir, <b>Education of a Wandering Man</b>; and a volume of poetry, <b>Smoke from This Altar</b>. There are more than 300 million copies of his books in print worldwide.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>20th Century Factory Glass</h2><p>The only comprehensive reference book regarding internationally produced glassware for the home, <i>20th Century Factory Glass</i> is required reading for glass collectors and enthusiasts alike. Featuring every great designer, from Louis Comfort Tiffany to Alvar Aalto, as well as companies from Baccarat to Steuben, this volume provides clues to identifying marks, codes, and labels.<br></p><p>Sure, glass has been around since ancient Mesopotamia, but some say the real art of glass wasn't developed until relatively recently. In 250 pages filled with photographs and information, <i>20th Century Factory Glass</i> examines the myriad ways that a few minerals can combine with high heat to create delicate and colorful objects of beauty. In an effort to simplify material, the sections are arranged not by time period, but alphabetically by artist or company. From Fenton to Whitefriars, Anchor Hocking to Orrefors, author Lesley Jackson has collected information on nearly 100 manufacturers, and the text includes facts about the financial history of the company, as well as its artistic inspirations. There are many books devoted to Tiffany stained glass, but how many of them discuss his Aquamarine glass, or the business backing he provided for the Nash family to conduct glass-related experiments? Companies such as Ravenhead, one of the pioneers in machine-made glass, are also discussed in detail, with the fully automatic Westlake machine playing a prominent part. The accompanying photos for each section were chosen to showcase the variety from each designer, rather than focusing on one spectacular piece. As many of these companies were in business for most of the century, Jackson takes care to demonstrate stylistic changes throughout the decades. Orrefors is a perfect example of these changes. In the '90s, they were recognized for clean lines coupled with striking variations in thickness--but closer to the time of their founding in 1898, their designs featured elaborate engravings and Graal patterns. Whether you plan to use it for looking or learning, this book is an educational treat. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Lesley Jackson, writer and curator, organized a major exhibition on Whitefriars Glass and co-wrote the accompanying catalog.</p><h2>Breakout</h2><p><b>A Mystery Writers of America Grand Master</b><p> In a city at the center of an empty state, Parker is caught moving drugs into a waiting truck.

The coastline lures visitors, but it is the food that will make you linger. Chef Efisio Farris is poised to become the next great ambassador of Italian regional cuisine. To promote the cooking of his native Sardinia, he has appeared on the Food Network, given demonstrations at food festivals across the country, and even launched his own company that imports Sardinian specialties for his restaurants and for retail. It is Mediterranean cooking at its purest, making liberal use of olive oil, fish, and fresh vegetables. But it&#x2019;s also distinguished by indigenous ingredients that are becoming hot trends in America: pecorino, flatbread, fava beans, fregula, and bottarga. Farris has pulled together more than one hundred recipes&#x2013;many of them family secrets. Among them are Watermelon Salad with Arugula and Ricotta Salata; Pannacotta with Bitter Honey; and Bruschetta with Sausage and Pecorino Sardo. More than 150 breathtaking images take you on a tour of the countryside&#x2013;from the terraced olive groves to the riverbanks full of wild asparagus. In sidebars, the author relates charming anecdotes and Sardinian history. Readers will come away not just with a taste for the island&#x2019;s flavors but also a sense of Sardinia&#x2019;s magical beauty and culture.</p><p><b>Efisio Farris</b>, a native Sardinian, is the chef-owner of two restaurants&#x2013;Arcodoro in Houston and Arcodoro &amp; Pomodoro in Dallas. He has garnered acclaim from <i>Gourmet,</i> <i>Saveur</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, <i>Southern Living</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>Wine Spectator</i>.Introduction History Matters From the moment you sit down at our table, the important thing is not how much we serve you but that we welcome you by serving the best of what we have. In my family that usually meant some pane carasau (Sardinian music bread), pecorino, sausage, and my father&#39;s olives or baby artichokes preserved in oil, perhaps then a plate of pasta or a dish from the &#34;cucina rustica.&#34; It is also important that we serve some of what we have made or grown ourselves; Sardinian cuisine relies on fresh ingredients and straightforward preparations to preserve and enhance the flavor of those ingredients. The foundation is simple and rustic, uncomplicated yet hearty, deep in flavor and texture--not to mention tradition (many recipes have changed little over centuries and are tied to ancient customs and habits) and variety (only Sicily and Piedmont rival our agricultural production). Meat, cheese, and pasta are the most prominent staples of our diet. Though seafood is now very popular, most fish dishes, aside from a few, date back no more than a couple of centuries--young by Sardinian standards. Despite 1,800 kilometers of magnificent coastline--pure white sands, hidden coves and grottos, picturesque cliffs that soar above caves and rocks framed by the bluest sea and sky--Sardinia does not have an ancient seafaring tradition. We are known as a &#34;nation of shepherds&#34;: more than one hundred thousand shepherds live in Sardinia, and sheep outnumber people on the island three to one. Moreover, our most populated regions and deepest cultural and culinary traditions tend to be inland.</p><h2>Instant Weather Forecasting</h2><p>Instant Weather Forecasting has been a perennial bestseller since it was first published over 30 years ago.

The author&#39;s way of connecting to the people around us is based on generosity. He strongly distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the superficiality associated with networking. In Never Eat Alone, the author lays out the specific set of steps and the mindset he employs to connect with thousands of colleagues, friends and associates. This new edition is updated with extensive chapters on how to use social media to connect with people in business and beyond.</p><p><p>A cover article in <i>Inc.</i> magazine on YaYa CEO Keith Ferrazzi's secrets to networking generated the largest response the magazine has received in the past ten years. Now Ferrazzi, working with <i>Inc</i>. writer Tahl Raz, explains the guiding principles he has mastered over a lifetime of reaching out to explain what it takes to build the kind of lasting, mutually beneficial relationships that lead to professional and personal success.<br><br>For Ferrazzi, the son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, the ability to connect with others paved the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and a prestigious posting to management consulting giant Deloitte Consulting. He discovered early on in life that the key to what makes successful people different from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships. The sharing of knowledge, resources, time, and energy with people they know and trust is the foundation of their success. In NEVER EAT ALONE, Ferrazzi distinguishes such genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handing usually associated with the word "networking." He distills the ways he uses to reach out to others into practical proven principles, such as:<br><br>� Look for mentors: Link up with people who can help guide your career and can introduce you to the people you need to know. Then become a mentor yourself.<br><br>� Be interesting: Develop the style, knowledge, and expertise that will draw others to you.<br><br>� Build it before you need it: Create lists of people you know&#x2014;and those you want to know&#x2014;and maintain ongoing contacts with them throughout your life and career&#x2014;not just when you need a favor.<br><br>� Never eat alone: Avoid the fate of "invisibility"&#x2014;use potential social settings to constantly reach out to colleagues and future contacts.<br><br>Ferrazzi's form of connecting is based on a spirit of generosity. He cautions readers not to keep score. Helping colleagues connect with other friends creates the kind of goodwill that inevitably pays its own dividends. Full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, and more, NEVER EAT ALONE is destined to be the <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> of the new millennium.</p><p>KEITH FERRAZZI is founder and CEO of the training and consulting company Ferrazzi Greenlight and a contributor to <i>Inc., </i>the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> and <i>Harvard Business Review</i>.

Malkki shifts the focus of the study of humanitarian intervention from aid recipients to aid workers themselves. The anthropological commitment to understand the motivations and desires of these professionals and how they imagine themselves in the world "out there," led Malkki to spend more than a decade interviewing members of the international Finnish Red Cross, as well as observing Finns who volunteered from their homes through gifts of handwork. The need to help, she shows, can come from a profound neediness&#x2014;the need for aid workers and volunteers to be part of the lively world and something greater than themselves, and, in the case of the elderly who knit "trauma teddies" and "aid bunnies" for "needy children," the need to fight loneliness and loss of personhood. In seriously examining aspects of humanitarian aid often dismissed as sentimental, or trivial, Malkki complicates notions of what constitutes real political work. She traces how the international is always entangled in the domestic, whether in the shape of the need to leave home or handmade gifts that are an aid to sociality and to the imagination of the world.</p><p>Liisa H. Malkki is Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University. She is the author of <i>Purity and Exile: Violence, Memory, and National Cosmology among Hutu Refugees in Tanzania</i>, and the coauthor of <i>Improvising Theory: Process and Temporality in Ethnographic Fieldwork</i>."With <i>The Need to Help</i> Liisa H. Malkki changes the agenda of the study of humanitarianism. This is much more than a study of Finnish humanitarians, as Malkki provides an extended meditation on a range of neglected topics in the study of humanitarianism, picking up and addressing fresh conceptual and moral questions.

By the author of Delivered from Evil. National ad/promo.</p><p>Robert Leckie (1920 2001) served in the 1st Marine Division during World War II and authored more than forty books on American war history, including The Wars of America: From 1600 to 1900.Leckie (None Died in Vain, 1990, etc.) retreads familiar terrain in lively style--in this retelling of the story of the American Revolution. Beginning with a recapitulation of the French and Indian War- -which, though ending in British victory, represented the beginning of the end of the British empire in America--Leckie briskly recounts the well-known events leading to America's break with Britain and the military development of the war. In anecdotal biographical sketches, he draws vivid portraits of the war's principals: George III, George Washington, Thomas Gage, Lord Cornwallis, and Benedict Arnold, among others. Leckie summarizes the principal battles of the war--Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill, Washington's disastrous Long Island and Manhattan campaigns, his victories at Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, and Yorktown--in lucid, workmanlike fashion. In superb depictions of the British leaders and of the British home front, he also adds details rarely found in popular American histories, and, unlike some historians, he doesn't neglect the southern war--the battles of Camden, Cowpens, and King's Mountain are covered as thoroughly as any. But although Leckie is a superior narrator of military and personal dramas, he offers no particularly interesting interpretations of the war's events, and he limits his reflections on its aftermath to praising our constitutional government as ``an ideal of perfection in representative government.'' Short on analysis, but, still, an enjoyable popular history. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is at the same time a history of language, a guide to foreign tongues, and a method for learning them. It shows, through basic vocabularies, family resemblances of languages -- Teutonic, Romance, Greek -- helpful tricks of translation, key combinations of roots and phonetic patterns. It presents by common-sense methods the most helpful approach to the mastery of many languages; it condenses vocabulary to a minimum of essential words; it simplifies grammar in an entirely new way; and it teaches a language as it is actually used in everyday life.Frederick Bodmer is a distinguished Swiss philologist.</p><h2>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales</h2><p>Brimming with tales of terror, suspense, and the uncanny, with dark castles and even gloomier monasteries, <em>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales</em> offers the first such collection devoted to this spine-tingling genre. Though Gothic fiction has generally been identified with Walpole's"Castle of Otranto" and the works of Ann Radcliffe, these thirty-seven selections compiled by Chris Baldick provide a unique look at the genre's development into its present-day forms. We see standard gothic elements of incest, murder, and greed in "The Poisoner of Montremos," a late eighteenth-century story by Richard Cumberland. We find in Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" the tale that set a new standard of decadence for Gothic stories. In Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily," a woman's death satisfies a neighborhood's curiosity with a bizarre discovery. All the stories contain the common elements of the gothic tale: a warped sense of time, a claustrophobic setting, a link to archaic modes of thought, dynastic corruption, and the impression of a descent into disintegration. Yet they also reveal the progression of the genre from stories of feudal villains amid crumbling ruins to a greater level of sophistication in which writers brought the gothic tale out of its medieval setting, and placed it in the contemporary world.<br> Bringing together the work of such writers as Robert Louis Stevenson, Eudora Welty, Thomas Hardy, Edgar Allan Poe, William Faulkner, Isak Dinesen, Arthur Conan Doyle, Joyce Carol Oates, Jorge Luis Borges, Eudora Welty, Patrick McGrath, and Isabel Allende, <em>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales</em> presents a wide array of the sinister and unsettling for all lovers of ghost stories, fantasy, and horror.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>:<br> <strong>Chris Baldick</strong> is a Lecturer in English at the University of Lancaster. He is the author of <em>In Frankenstein's Shadow: Myth and Monstrosity in Nineteenth-Century Writing</em> (1987).<br>The fog-enshrouded castle, the crumbling family manor; old secrets unveiled, curses cast, chains clanking, fear and trembling; dread, decay, disintegration, death--each of these trademarks of the well-made Gothic tale is vividly represented in this comprehensive anthology. Informatively introduced and chronologically arranged, the 37 stories showcase the Gothic tradition from its late-18th-century inception up to the present. Included are genre classics from such illustrious practitioners as Poe, Hawthorne, Lovecraft and McGrath, as well as gems from literary masters like Faulkner, Welty, Oates and Borges, all of whom dabble(d) to fine effect in the form. Among the highlights are "The Parricide Punished," an anonymous entry from 1799 set in an enormous castle and narrated by a guest whose visit becomes a waking nightmare; Eden Glasgow's "Jordan's End," in which a long history of family madness gives rise to a most untimely death; F. M. Mayor's "Miss DeMannering of Asham," the story of two women on holiday who get more local color than they bargained for when they learn the shocking truth about DeMannering's dead infant; and especially Ray Russell's bizarre "Sardonicus," whose title character gives the kind of villainous performance that evokes Vincent Price in his horror-movie heyday. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Integrated iScience Teacher Edition Volume 1 Course 1</h2><p>Integrated iScience TE, volume 1</p><p></p><h2>Winter Walk, paperback</h2><p><p>Slide, step, and stomp through the snow with &#x201c;Grammy&#x201d; as she takes her grandkids on a winter adventure.

And at the heart of his palace is the Sultan&#x2019;s vast Harem, the domain of hundreds of scented, pampered women&#x2014;some wives, some concubines, some merely slaves. Among them is Gulbehar, the Sultan&#x2019;s submissive favorite and mother of his heir; Julia, the daughter of an Italian lord, kidnapped when she attempted to flee Venice with her lover; and H�rrem, a Tartar girl from the Russian steppes, sold into slavery. <br><br>All three women are beautiful, but H�rrem is the most dangerous&#x2014;ruthless in her desire to rule the Harem and, ultimately, Suleyman himself. Endlessly manipulative and clever, she carefully arranges the downfall of her rivals and endears herself to the Sultan, which places her at the center of the Empire&#x2019;s power. It is his obsession with H�rrem&#x2014;not his enemies&#x2014;that costs Suleyman his allies, his sons, and ?nally his dynasty.<br><br>Bestselling author Colin Falconer offers an irresistible glimpse into a world of intrigue, sensuality, and violence, where an empire can be controlled not by the might of its ruler, but by the women hidden behind the Harem walls.</p><p>COLIN FALCONER is the author of <b>When We Were Gods</b> and <b>Feathered Serpent</b> as well as several other historical novels, which have been published throughout the world.

Some of his men had run, their nerve broken; Mustapha had cut them down with his sword, then rallied his soldiers again for a renewed effort.<br><br>And now, for the first time that day, he was afraid.<br><br>"How many men?" the young man on the throne repeated.<br><br>Mustapha dared to raise his head a little to stare into the Sultan's eyes. Oh, great God. "Twenty thousand, Lord," he whispered.<br><br>"Twenty thousand!" He leaped to his feet and every man in the room&#x2014;except one&#x2014;took a pace backward.<br><br>In the long silence that followed, several of the generals thought they could hear Mustapha try to swallow.<br><br>When Sultan Suleyman spoke again, his voice was soft and sibilant. Like the death rattle in a man's throat, Mustapha thought. "You advocated this expedition. For three centuries the infidels have taunted the Osmanlis from this fortress. Even the Fatih and my father Selim could not dislodge them. But you told your Sultan that this time it would be different!"<br><br>Mustapha was silent. He knew there could be no excuse for failure. Besides, he could not be sure his men would follow him to the walls again.<br><br>The silk of Suleyman's robes rippled in the light of the oil lamps as his body shook with the force of his rage. His hands were clenched into white fists at his side. A froth of spittle had formed in the corners of his mouth.<br><br>"Another twenty thousand of your Sultan's army lie in the mud at the foot of this accursed rock, the rest are afflicted with the pestilence, and still the walls stand! Winter is at hand; even now the storms are boiling on the horizon, ready to shatter the fleet and freeze the rest of your Sultan's army. Yet if Suleyman turns away now, it will be to drag the banner of the Osmanli, the banner of Islam, in the dirt! You brought your Sultan to Rhodes. What will you have him do now?"<br><br>Mustapha was silent.<br><br>"You advised this!" he screamed, and he stabbed his finger at the second vizier as if it were an iron spike. He turned to the bostanji waiting in the shadows, a sullen and malevolent presence. He made a quick motion with his hands to summon the deaf-mute and screamed, "Execute him!"<br><br>The negro strode forward and shoved Mustapha to his knees with one expert motion of his left leg and arm. The bands of muscle in the man's back tensed as he brought his killic above his head to strike.<br><br>It was old Piri Pasha, the Grand Vizier, who moved first. He stepped forward, both hands held upward in supplication, momentarily distracting the bostanji. The blade of the killic glittered in the light of the oil lamps.<br><br>"Great Lord, please! Spare him! Misguided he may be, but he has fought like a lion in front of the walls! I have seen him&#x2014;"<br><br>"Quiet!" Suleyman screamed, and now there was saliva on his beard. "If you think he is so worthy, then you can join him in Paradise!"<br><br>It was as if an unseen hand had swept the room with a scythe. Piri Pasha! He was an old man, the Vizier who had survived Selim the Grim, and had been Suleyman's own tutor as a child. He himself had advised against the attack on Rhodes. The generals and counselors assembled in front of the young Sultan fell on their faces, each of them moaning forbearance.<br><br>It was only Ibrahim, the falconer, who dared approach him. "My Lord," he whispered, and took Suleyman's hand. He knelt, and kissed the ruby on the ring finger of his right hand.<br><br>Suleyman was about to summon his bostanji for a third commission when he recognized the young man at his feet.<br><br>"Ibrahim!"<br><br>"Great Lord, there is another way."<br><br>Suleyman seemed about to pull away from the young man, who still held his hand in both of his. Instead he said: "Tell it, then."<br><br>"The histories tell us that the Greeks besieged Troy for fourteen years for the sake of a woman. Will not the Turk, then, oppressed by piracies and invasions from this rock for over three centuries, endure one winter's siege?"<br><br>The bostanji shifted his weight. The killic was growing heavy.<br><br>"What is your counsel, Ibrahim?"<br><br>"They say that when one of the Roman Caesars invaded an island, he would burn his fleet on the beach. Great Lord, perhaps if you were to build a villa on this hill, in full view of the castle, the defenders will know there is to be no reprieve until the fortress is ours. It will crush their spirit. And if our soldiers know your conviction also, it will give them heart."<br><br>Suleyman sighed, and eased himself back on to the great throne. With his forefinger he caressed one of the turquoise stones inlaid near the arm. "And what of them?" he said, nodding in the direction of the two men who still knelt, heads bowed, below the killic. He looked at old Piri Pasha and winced. How could he have contemplated such a thing?<br><br>"There has been too much Turkish blood spilled today already," Ibrahim said.<br><br>What a diplomat you are! Suleyman thought. An almost imperceptible shake of the head and the bostanji vanished once more into the shadows.<br><br>"Very well," Suleyman told them. "The Sultan stays."</p><h2>Dragons at Crumbling Castle: And Other Stories</h2><p><b>A beautifully illustrated collection of short stories by master storyteller Sir Terry Pratchett, featuring dragons, dinosaurs, cavemen and car races!</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragons have invaded Crumbling Castle, and all of King Arthur's knights are either on holiday or visiting their grannies.

Examples of solid prose are not difficult to come by: a well argued legal judgment, a lucid scientific paper, or a readily grasped set of technical instructions. Inspired prose, however, is a much rarer thing. In <em>The</em> <em>New Oxford Book of English Prose</em>, John Gross has gathered together those rare jewels of the English language that take plain prose to artistic heights.<br> The pared-down style of Hemingway didnt happen overnight. Beginning with Sir Thomas Malory and ending with Kazuo Ishiguro, this anthology chronologically traces the evolution of prose, which gained confidence and extended its range in the late seventeenth century. It wasnt until the eighteenth century, however, that the ornate style of literary giants like Milton and Donne gave way to prose that was recognizably modern. The material included in this anthology is literary, but literary, as the editor states in the introduction, is not the narrow term that it is often made to beit embraces an enormous range of experience and response. <em>The New Oxford Book of English Prose</em> pays tribute to literatures vibrant diversity by offering glimpses of master craftsmanship from around the globe. Included here are excerpts from writers of such varied backgrounds as Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Vladimir Nabokov, and Mulk Raj Anand.<br> From the eloquent political treatises of Burke to the bold narrative strokes of Herman Melville, readers will find that the selections contained within this volume superbly illustrate the expressive powers of prose.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Gross</strong> is former editor of the <em>TLS</em> and currently theatre critic of the <em>Sunday Telegraph</em>, and reviews widely. He has previously edited the Oxford Books of <em>Aphorisms</em> (1983), <em>Essays</em> (1991), and <em>Comic Verse</em> (1994).<br>This new anthology of writing in English proves to be much more than a revision of the Oxford Book of English Prose. Gross, a journalist and editor of the Oxford Books of Aphorisms (1987), Essays (LJ 2/1/91), and Comic Verse (1994), collects some of the same authors, but he makes different selections. Gross bases his choices on their literary, not historical, significance, and his attempt to be international in his selections is the strength of this anthology. Of the over 490 authors included, 21 percent are American, and 11 percent hail from countries such as Ireland, Canada, Australia, India, South Africa, and Nigeria. Additionally, 12 percent of the writers represented are women, and 20th-century writers are included. Writers' nationalities are indicated in the index.

Wrexham is here.&#x201d;<br><br>Her heart leaping at her aunt&#x2019;s disconcerting news, Lady Eleanor Pierce froze on the sidelines of the crowded hall. &#x201c;Here? Tonight? At Carlton House?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed. His arrival was just announced.&#x201d; Elea?nor&#x2019;s proper aunt and chaperone, Lady Beldon, made a sour face. &#x201c;The nerve of him! He should have the decency to respect your sensibilities.&#x201d;<br><br>Eleanor agreed that Damon Stafford, Viscount Wrexham, had a great deal of nerve. In truth, Damon was the boldest man of her acquaintance. But she had braced her sensibilities against the impact of seeing him again&#x2014;or so she&#x2019;d believed until just this moment.<br><br>Eleanor smiled in an effort to pretend composure and to slow her all too rapid heartbeat. &#x201c;I daresay Lord Wrexham has a right to attend Prinny&#x2019;s fete, Aunt Beatrix. No doubt he was invited, just as we were.&#x201d;<br><br>George, Prince of Wales and currently England&#x2019;s Regent, regularly entertained at Carlton House, his garishly grand London residence. And Lady Beldon was sometimes included on the guest list, since her late husband had been an intimate of the pleasure-loving Regent&#x2019;s set.<br><br>Tonight the overheated mansion was filled with a crush of elegant gentry and aristocrats. Yet a surreptitious glance around the thronged hall told Eleanor that the charming rake who had once won her heart and then trampled on it was nowhere in sight.<br><br>&#x201c;You make too much of the matter,&#x201d; Eleanor murmured, hiding her relief. &#x201c;Wrexham is perfectly at liberty to move about society as he pleases.&#x201d;<br><br>Her Aunt Beatrix gave her a piercing stare. &#x201c;Surely you do not mean to defend him? After he treated you so abominably?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, certainly not. But I am resigned to meeting him again. It must happen eventually. He has been in London for a sennight, and we move in similar circles.&#x201d;<br><br>Lady Beldon shook her head in disgust, then studied her niece more closely. &#x201c;Perhaps we should take our leave, Eleanor. I will tender our excuses to Prinny&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no intention of running from Lord Wrexham, dearest Aunt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you must prepare yourself. He may appear at any moment.&#x201d;<br><br>Nodding distractedly, Eleanor drew a deep breath. She was as prepared as she would ever be to encounter the wickedly charming nobleman who had been her betrothed.<br><br>She&#x2019;d had several days&#x2019; warning that Damon had returned to London after a two-year absence, since Lady Beldon&#x2019;s friends were eager to keep her abreast of society gossip. Eleanor had carefully planned what she would say to him, and how she would act. She would be gracious and cool and completely indifferent, showing him common politeness but no more.<br><br>&#x201c;I am capable of facing him with equanimity,&#x201d; she avowed, her calm assertion belying the butterflies rioting in her stomach.<br><br>Aunt Beatrix, however, was neither convinced nor willing to excuse his lordship&#x2019;s past sins. &#x201c;You should not be compelled to face that scoundrel. Were he a true gentleman, he would have the good manners to stay away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has stayed away,&#x201d; Eleanor said with a dry edge to her tone. &#x201c;For two years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even so, his absence was not long enough! Indeed, I think he should be banned from polite society entirely.&#x201d;<br><br>Regrettably, Damon&#x2019;s crime against her didn&#x2019;t quite justify so severe a punishment, Eleanor reflected. &#x201c;I suspect banishment might be a bit too harsh, darling Auntie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not in the least. And I will never forgive myself for introducing you to that wicked rogue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are not to blame. You did not actually introduce us, if you will recall.&#x201d;<br><br>The elder woman waved an elegant hand in dismissal. &#x201c;Wrexham met you at my annual house party, which amounts to the same thing as an introduction. Had I not welcomed him into our home, you would never have been exposed to heartbreak and ridicule. But he was a friend of Marcus&#x2019;s. How could we know he would turn out to be such a libertine?&#x201d;<br><br>How indeed? Eleanor wondered silently.<br><br>Her beloved older brother Marcus had thought very highly of Damon until the eventful dissolution of her betrothal&#x2014;as had she. With his stirring good looks and his reckless, devil-may-care charm, Damon was every young lady&#x2019;s illicit fantasy, and every matron&#x2019;s worry.<br><br>As far as motherly natures went, Beatrix Attree, Viscountess Beldon, harbored very few nurturing instincts. Yet she&#x2019;d taken in Eleanor after her parents&#x2019; deaths when she was but ten years old, and had been her chaperone ever since. And Beatrix loved Eleanor as much as she was capable of loving anyone.<br><br>Her ladyship was an aristocrat to the core, and she had strict notions of what was proper for the nobility. In the beginning she&#x2019;d made allowances for Lord Wrexham, despite his rather wild reputation, because he held an illustrious title that went back several hundred years and a fortune that was even larger than Eleanor&#x2019;s.<br><br>For her own part, Eleanor had cared little for Damon&#x2019;s title or wealth. It was the nobleman himself who inspired her ardor. The first moment they met, she&#x2019;d felt a lightning bolt of attraction for him, as well as a connection she rarely experienced with any other man.<br><br>Falling in love with him had been ridiculously easy.<br><br>Of course, her foolishness in succumbing to his irresistible allure could possibly be excused by her relative youth at the time. She was only nineteen then, and in her girlish heart she had yearned for a wildly romantic love. A suitor who made her burn, who made her feel feverish and desired, just as Damon did.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been spellbound for those few short weeks of their whirlwind courtship and engagement, believing they were ideally matched, that Damon was the man of her dreams. She had expected&#x2014;hoped&#x2014;to live with him happily ever after as his wife. Until that fateful morning two years ago when she spied him driving in Hyde Park with his beautiful mistress, not only not bothering to hide his affair but actually flaunting it.<br><br>Feeling grievously hurt and betrayed, Eleanor had immediately terminated their engagement and vowed to have nothing more to do with Damon. He had broken her heart as well as severely embarrassing her and savaging her pride. Even now, she couldn&#x2019;t quell her lingering resentment. Yet she refused to cower at the thought of facing him&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Lady Beldon announced, breaking into her niece&#x2019;s thoughts, &#x201c;if you insist on staying tonight, you would do well to keep Prince Lazzara by your side in the event Wrexham has the gall to approach you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shall, Aunt. His highness only stepped away to fetch some refreshments for us.&#x201d;<br><br>An Italian nobleman, Principe Antonio Lazzara di Terrasini had come to England in the company of his elder distant cousin, il Signor Umberto Vecchi, who was a diplomat to the British court. Reportedly the prince was in the market for a bride and was considering Lady Eleanor for the position.<br><br>Eleanor well knew that her chief attractions had little to do with her character or intellect. She was a notable heiress in her own right, due to the extensive fortune left to her by her mother. She was also the daughter of a baron, and now the sister of an earl, since her elder brother Marcus had recently inherited the Danvers earldom from his own distant relation.<br><br>However, she hadn&#x2019;t yet decided how seriously she wished to be considered as Prince Lazzara&#x2019;s future princess. Admittedly she was attracted to him. His sensual voice and melting dark eyes were the very essence of romance. He was also handsome, engaging, charming, and witty&#x2014;and from all reports, as much of a rake as Damon had ever been.<br><br>And after her disastrous betrothal to Damon&#x2014; followed by a second, even briefer betrothal to another nobleman shortly afterward&#x2014;Eleanor was adamant that the next time she became engaged, it would be for good. More crucially, she would only marry a man whom she loved and who loved her in return.<br><br>Just then a hush fell over one end of the hall. Eleanor suspected that Prinny had entered with his entourage. But when her aunt stiffened and muttered &#x201c;Speak of the devil&#x201d; under her breath, Eleanor realized that it was not only His Royal Highness who had attracted attention.<br><br>Damon Stafford, Viscount Wrexham, stood beside the Regent, drawing all eyes, including hers.<br><br>The company began bowing and scraping fawningly to Prinny, while Lord Wrexham casually surveyed the elite gathering&#x2014;and the gathering returned the favor.</p><h2>Timely Rain: Selected Poetry of Chogyam Trungpa (Shambhala Centaur Editions)</h2><p>Newly selected poetry from previously published and unpublished works, <i>Timely Rain </i> is the definitive edition of poems and sacred songs of the renowned Tibetan meditation master.</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

Fragments of women's stories must be gleaned from the more cohesive stories of their fathers, husbands and sons. Fragmented Women begins with the premise that, to recover shards of women's stories from androcentric texts like the Bible, it is necessary to step outside the ideology of the text, subverting the patriarchal perspective that has focused attention on the male characters. In this important new work, the author draws on contemporary feminist literary theory to critique the dominant male voice of the biblical narrative and to construct (sub)versions of women's stories from the submerged strains of their voices in men's stories.&gt;</p><p></p><h2>The Shadow: 1941 - Hitler&#39;s Astrologer</h2><p>Book and DJ in excellent condition... some minor shelf wear!</p><p></p><h2>Dreaming the Bull (#2)</h2><p>Boudica, &#x201c;She Who Brings Victory.&#x201d; Born to the Eceni, a tribe of dreamers and warriors, she is her people&#x2019;s last hope: a copper-haired warrior who can lead her tribe in battle&#x2014;and speak the language of the sacred dreamers. But in the face of a battle half won, Boudica has retreated with the living and wounded. Because across a river is the world&#x2019;s mightiest army. And with the invaders comes a strange, bloodthirsty warrior astride a pied horse&#x2014;a man who seems to know the Eceni as well as they know themselves. For just as destiny marked the young queen for greatness, it was destiny, too, that drove Boudica&#x2019;s half brother to a far different path. Now brother and sister will stand on opposite sides of a brutal war of attrition, each unknowingly determined to see the other dead.</p><p>The second part of the stunning fictionalization of the life of Britain?s warrior queen, Boudica, immerses us in a world of druids and dreamers, warriors and lovers, passion and courage. Originally a trilogy, this is now a four-part series.<br><br>?Boudica? means ?Bringer of Victory? (from the early Celtic word ?boudeg?). She was the last defender of the Celtic culture; the only woman openly to lead her warriors into battle and to stand successfully against the might of Imperial Rome -- and triumph.<br><br>Book one, <b>Dreaming the Eagle</b>, took readers from Boudica?s girlhood with the Eceni tribe to the climax of the two-day battle when she and her lover, Caradoc, faced the invading Romans. Believing her dead, Breaca?s beloved brother, B�n, joined the Roman cause.<br><br><b>Dreaming the Bull</b>, the second book in this compelling series, continues the intertwined stories of Boudica, and B�n, now an officer in the Roman cavalry. They stand on opposite sides in a brutal war of attrition between the occupying army and the defeated tribes, each determined to see the other dead. In a country under occupation, Caradoc, lover to Breaca, is caught and faces the ultimate penalty. Only B�n has the power to save him, and B�n has spent the past ten years denying his past. Treachery divides these two; heroism brings them together again, changed out of all recognition -- but it may not be enough to heal the wounds.<br><br><b>Dreaming the Bull</b> is a heart-stopping story of war and of peace; of love, passion and betrayal; of druids and warring gods, where each life is sacred and each death even more so; and where Breaca and B�n learn the terrible distances they must travel to fulfill their own destinies.<br><i>Through the summer, Cunomar came to recognize two different kinds of warriors. The smaller group consisted of those few men and women still alive who had known his mother before the two-day battle against the invading legions. These were her friends and they called her Breaca in the way Cunomar?s father and the innermost circle of the honour guard still did. The rest, who had met her only in battle or, worse, knew her only by reputation, gave the warrior?s salute in a way that was subtly different and hailed her as the Boudica, bringer of victory. She didn?t enjoy that, but in the short span of his life, Cunomar had watched his mother become more comfortable with name, so that it settled on her like a worn cloak and she did not stiffen at the sound of it. <br><br>He had heard her use the word herself for the first time that morning as a cold dawn sharpened the air and Nemain, the moon, lowered into her bed in the mountains. Breaca had stood on the back of her mare and addressed the massed ranks of warriors and dreamers, naming them all Boudegae, bringers of victory, and swearing before them that she would fight for as long as it took to rid the land of the invader.</i> -- from <b>Dreaming the Bull</b><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>Praise for <i>Dreaming the Eagle</i>:</b><br>&#x201c;[Scott&#x2019;s] characters are so true to life that they all but jump off the page, and the story is alive with the love, deceit, wisdom and heroics of humanity.

This illustrated history examines Pullman's diverse fleet, from its spectacular custom-built wooden cars of the nineteenth century to steel heavyweight cars in the prewar years and on into the lightweight streamlined era. Author Joe Welsh includes period photos, many in rare color, as well as car diagrams and ads that help trace the development, composition, and evolution of the historically and culturally significant Pullman fleet, including the gamut of sleeper, parlor, and restaurant cars. This is a fitting tribute to the former cultural icons aboard which strode giants of American life, such as Babe Ruth and Clark Gable, as well as first-time travelers from small-town America.</p></p><p><p>Joe Welsh is a regular contributor to <i>Trains</i> and <i>Classic Trains </i>magazines and has appeared on the History Channel. He is the author of 12 books including the critically acclaimed <i>Travel by Pullman</i>, co-authored with William F. Howes, Jr. He resides in Auburn, Washington.<br><br></p> <p>Kevin J. Holland is a freelance writer, editor, and publications designer based in Burlington, Ontario. He has written and produced more than 15 books and is a regular contributor to <i>Classic Trains</i>.<br><br> Bill Howes&#x2019; is the former director of The Pullman Company and a former vice-president of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. Mr. Howes is the co-author of <i>Travel by Pullman</i> and vice-president of the Railway &amp; Locomotive Historical Society. He lives in Florida.</p><p></p>The real glory of this handsomely designed book is its rich illustration.&nbsp; Joe Welsh, Bill Howes , and Kevin J. Holland are top-notch photo researchers and archivists, which they prove here with a great selection of 19th century glass-late photos, heavy-weight-era publicity photos, Pullman promotions and car diagrams, and some impressive postwar color action.&nbsp; The authors also have the good sense to go beyond train and car photos.&nbsp; Using photographer Jim Scribbins&#x2019; candid interior view of the Seaboard Air Line&#x2019;s peerless Sun Lounge across a full spread is brilliant photo editing and typical of the entire book.&nbsp; Anyone interested in passenger railroading &#x2013; including modelers &#x2013; will love this book. <i><b>Trains</b></i><b> - November 2010</b><p></p></p><h2>From What Is to What If: Unleashing the Power of Imagination to Create the Future We Want</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Big ideas that just might save the world&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>The Guardian</em></strong></p> <p><strong>The founder of the international Transition Towns movement asks why true creative, positive thinking is in decline, asserts that it's more important now than ever, and suggests ways our communities can revive and reclaim it.</strong></p> <p>In these times of deep division and deeper despair, if there is a consensus about anything in the world, it is that the future is going to be awful. There is an epidemic of loneliness, an epidemic of anxiety, a mental health crisis of vast proportions, especially among young people. There&#x2019;s a rise in extremist movements and governments. Catastrophic climate change. Biodiversity loss. Food insecurity. The fracturing of ecosystems and communities beyond, it seems, repair. The future&#x2015;to say nothing of the present&#x2015;looks grim.</p> <p>But as Transition movement cofounder Rob Hopkins tells us, there is plenty of evidence that things can change, and cultures can change, rapidly, dramatically, and unexpectedly&#x2015;for the better. He has seen it happen around the world and in his own town of Totnes, England, where the community is becoming its own housing developer, energy company, enterprise incubator, and local food network&#x2015;with cascading benefits to the community that extend far beyond the projects themselves.</p> <p>We&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;have the capability to effect dramatic change, Hopkins argues, but we&#x2019;re failing because we&#x2019;ve largely allowed our most critical tool to languish: human imagination. As defined by social reformer John Dewey, imagination is&nbsp;<em>the ability to look at things as if they could be otherwise</em>. The ability, that is, to ask <em>What if?</em> And if there was ever a time when we needed that ability, it is now.</p> <p>Imagination is central to empathy, to creating better lives, to envisioning and then enacting a positive future. Yet imagination is also demonstrably in decline at precisely the moment when we need it most. In this passionate exploration, Hopkins asks why imagination is in decline, and what we must do to revive and reclaim it. Once we do, there is no end to what we might accomplish.</p> <p><em>From What Is to What If</em> is a call to action to reclaim and unleash our collective imagination, told through the stories of individuals and communities around the world who are doing it now, as we speak, and witnessing often rapid and dramatic change for the better.</p></p><p><p>Rob Hopkins is a cofounder of Transition Town Totnes and Transition Network, and the author of <em>From What Is to What If?</em>, <em>The Power of Just Doing Stuff</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Transition Handbook</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Transition Companion</em>. In 2012 he was voted one of the <em>Independent</em>&#x2019;s top 100 environmentalists and was on Nesta and the <em>Observer</em>&#x2019;s list of Britain&#x2019;s 50 New Radicals. Hopkins has also appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Four Thought</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>A Good Read</em>, in the French film phenomenon&nbsp;<em>Demain</em> and its sequel <em>Apres Demain</em>, and has spoken at TEDGlobal and three TEDx events. An Ashoka Fellow, Hopkins also holds a doctorate degree from the University of Plymouth and has received two honorary doctorates from the University of the West of England and the University of Namur. He is a keen gardener, a founder of New Lion Brewery in Totnes, and a director of Totnes Community Development Society, the group behind Atmos Totnes, an ambitious, community-led development project.

Without imagination, where are we?&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Sir Quentin Blake</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Rob Hopkins has long been a leader in imagining how we could remake our societies for the benefit of nature and humankind. His new book is a powerful call to imagine a better world. It should be widely read and appreciated.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Christiana Figueres, former Executive Secretary, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; lead negotiator, Paris Climate Agreement</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Few things distinguish human beings from the rest of life on earth. Among the most important are our unique powers of imagination. Ironically, our use&#x2015;and abuse&#x2015;of those powers has now wrought a complex crisis in our relationships with the planet and with each other. As Rob Hopkins eloquently shows in this powerful and passionate book, to survive and thrive we have to become more imaginative, not less, in how we live, work and connect. He demonstrates the transformative power of imagination in all areas of our lives and the dangers of its neglect, especially in the education of our children. <em>From What Is to What If?</em> takes us on an inspiring and urgent tour of the people and communities around the world that are reimagining the present to create more hopeful and sustainable futures for us all.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Sir Ken Robinson, educator; <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Day after day, week after week, the climate is changing and biodiversity is fading away. For a long time we tended to look the other way, but now, being on the edge of the cliff forces us to understand that we must act urgently. And because of this emergency it is our utmost duty to join forces. Not only among states, but among mayors, NGOs, associations, companies, and citizens. Among all those who are determined to act here and now.</p> <p>&#x201c;Towns and cities have already begun transition. Together, mayors have chosen to press ahead toward a healthier and safer world. Whether in Paris or in Totnes, initiatives are being launched and are encouraging us to shift from &#x2018;why not&#x2019; to &#x2018;how&#x2019; and from &#x2018;how &#x2018; to &#x2018;when.&#x2019; The movement must gain momentum and expand.</p> <p>&#x201c;We must act wherever we are with the resources we have at our disposal to fight global warming. It&#x2019;s no longer about thinking global and acting local; it&#x2019;s about acting local in order to act global in a better way.</p> <p>&#x201c;People like Rob Hopkins give us the courage to move forward. By setting an example, he shows us that we are right to place our hopes in a future in which men and women can act as stewards of their environment. The many stories in this book are evidence of the fact that for some people this future has already become a reality.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;If we could set our imaginations free to explore the possibilities of how to make this world a better place, it would be remarkable indeed. And as this brave and powerful book argues, our very survival may depend upon it. We have nothing to lose by following the ideas set out in these pages, and everything to gain.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Scott Barry Kaufman, psychologist, Columbia University; coauthor of <em>Wired to Create</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t stop reading this book, and ideas just wouldn&#x2019;t stop popping into my head. Rob Hopkins puts imagination back at the heart of future-dreaming, offering us an irresistible invitation to dream bigger and then make those dreams a reality.

Hopkins, cofounder of the global Transition movement, reminds us that an essential ingredient to navigating the various unravelings of the coming decades isn&#x2019;t just our community resilience, reskilling, and activism&#x2015;but our civic imagination.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Chuck Collins, Institute for Policy Studies; author of <em>Born on Third Base</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I love this book.

A music scholarship took her to the University of Illinois, where she met Joseph, a grad student with plans for starting a heavy equipment dealership in California. Marriage, house, kids, book club, Pilates.</p><p>She had been bitten while sitting at an outside table of a sidewalk caf� by a little boy wearing an Angry Birds shirt, a wild little thing with no mommy in sight. Not even a real bite, really, more of a nip. She cleaned and bandaged it at home. Joseph was away on business, no need to worry him.</p><p>Sharon died of fever in the master bedroom of her lovely Chico home.</p><p>She came back and ate her children; parts of them, at least.</p><p>Then she ate Joe when he got home from his trip. The kids helped her with Daddy. Since that day, Sharon had seen none of them and wouldn&#x2019;t have recognized them anyway.</p><p>Now, five months later, Sharon Douglas-Frye shuffled barefoot through a January hay field of brittle stubble, her feet black and torn, the meat worn off several toes. She wore the tatters of a floral-print nightgown that drooped off one shoulder, exposing an emaciated body with flattened breasts, jutting ribs, and skin the color of old wax. Her face was drawn and tight, decaying jaw muscles visible through holes in her flesh, teeth clicking incessantly. Her eyes were a cloudy blue shot through with black blood vessels.</p><p>The hay crackled beneath her feet and her arms flopped as she walked, following the sound of crows. That sound always meant food, either what the crow was eating or the crow itself, if it wasn&#x2019;t fast enough. The birds were usually too quick and clever to permit Sharon to catch them, however.</p><p>A few others of her kind slumped through the field around her. Sharon paid them no mind.</p><p>It was cool; the barest of breezes made her knotted hair rustle about her shoulders. She trudged directly through the skeletal remains of a cow, the bones gnawed clean, catching and ripping her nightgown on a thick, upward-curving rib. As she moved past, her left hand banged against the rib, and Sharon didn&#x2019;t notice when both her engagement and wedding rings at last rattled off her bony finger and dropped into the hay stubble.</p><p>The crows called, and Sharon kept moving.</p><p>To her right, a man who had once sold used cars moved through the field with jerking steps, still wearing the remains of a shirt and tie, his skin a mottled olive streaked with black, now split and hanging about him in loose, sour ribbons. Strands of a comb-over fluttered about a face so torn it revealed bone, and the car salesman was bent forward and to the side by a pair of fractured vertebrae, grinding against each other with every step.</p><p>The three coyotes that had been trailing the salesman for the past hour finally decided he posed no threat. They darted in and took him down at the knees, and the salesman groaned and flapped his arms as they devoured him.</p><p>Sharon didn&#x2019;t notice the coyotes. She heard crows.</p><p>A sharp, twisted piece of metal severed two toes on Sharon&#x2019;s left foot as she walked through the hay field. She stumbled, then got tangled in a swirl of burned electrical wiring. That made her fall down, and she crawled toward the sound of the crows for almost an hour before she managed to free herself of the wiring and could stand once more.</p><p>There were a lot of sharp things in this field, bent shapes and pieces of metal blackened by fire, scattered over a hundred yards. The hay stubble was brittle and ashy where it had been burned, snapping under her feet, and she could still smell the smoke from the fire. That usually meant food too. She fell again, this time tripping over a long, slender length of melted polymer, constructed in a honeycomb pattern. Sharon rose once more, walked on, and at last reached the place with the crows.</p><p>Half a dozen of the glossy black birds were perched on the fuselage of the Black Hawk helicopter, which lay on its side in the field. The tail boom was gone along with both turbines, and only the troop compartment and shattered cockpit remained, all of it scorched.</p><p>The crows shrieked in annoyance as Sharon stumbled to where the cockpit windscreen had been, a few melted fragments clinging to the edges of the frame. The body of a tall man was still strapped in the pilot&#x2019;s seat, slumped against his belts, his blackened skin picked away to reveal dripping, red meat. His flight helmet and head had been caved in when the cockpit hit the ground nose first, and so he was not moving.</p><p>Sharon moaned and reached inside, tugging at an arm, trying to bring it to her mouth, snapping her teeth. It didn&#x2019;t quite reach, and so she started to whine, pulling herself up through the frame and into the cockpit, tearing her own flesh on jagged aluminum and sharp Plexiglas. Her feet left the ground as she wriggled through, at last stuffing the fingers of the pilot&#x2019;s dead hand into her mouth. Sharon chewed and grunted, and the crows watched.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Orlando Worthy was a biter.</p><p>The Chico police had long ago nicknamed him Orlando the Impaler. He had drifted into the Northern California city at age twenty-six, after receiving parole on a seven-year stretch for armed robbery (he slashed a female store detective&#x2019;s face with a fish-cleaning knife in front of a discount store) and had remained in Chico for the next twenty-two years.</p><p>In those two-plus decades Orlando had bitten nineteen people during meth transactions, bar fights, domestic disturbances, and just because. He bit another nine police officers and seventeen store detectives over the course of fifty-three arrests for petty theft. He bit a cocker spaniel when it barked at him in Bidwell Park. As payment for the biting, he had been hit with nightsticks, pepper spray, Tasers, a beanbag round from a less-than-lethal police shotgun, two kitchen knives, a tire iron, and countless punches and kicks.</p><p>By the time he turned forty-eight&#x2014;the summer of the plague&#x2014;Orlando already looked like a zombie, the meth wasting his body and aging his features. He was so distorted by the drug that a twenty-year montage of his booking photos had become one of the highest-viewed online features at Faces of Meth, a dramatic progression of decline that he bragged was his second claim to fame.</p><p>His first was boosting. Orlando Worthy had been a professional shoplifter for his entire life. Not professional in the sense that he was too good to get caught&#x2014;he had been caught plenty of times, and his face was known by every cop, retailer, and security guard in Butte County&#x2014;but in the fact that he did it for a living and was skilled in using the tools of the trade.</p><p>His bony hands could snap off security tags faster than an electronic detacher. When he couldn&#x2019;t break the tags, he used wire cutters, or stuffed the goods inside foil-lined bags to defeat the electronic pedestals at the front doors. If a garment was affixed with ink tags, he would just put it in the freezer overnight and snap them off harmlessly in the morning. For the big, cabled Alpha tags, the screamers, he would go in with a large drink from 7-Eleven, dip the sensor until it shorted out, and then clip it off with his cutters. Retailers called this <i>drowning tags</i>. A flat-head screwdriver could get him into locked electronics and jewelry cases, and threats of violence and biting stopped most store owners and at least two-thirds of store detectives from trying to apprehend him.</p><p>Some weren&#x2019;t intimidated, and Orlando had taken his share of beatings.</p><p>Orlando Worthy stole whatever he could sell, and that was most everything. There were always buyers for Polo shirts, fragrances, Timberland boots, and Under Armour. Anything Apple was a hot commodity, as well as electronic games and learning toys. Shrimp, condoms, batteries, leather jackets, women&#x2019;s shoes, Lego, and pocketbooks&#x2014;everything had a market. He would steal powdered baby formula by the case and sell it to drug dealers who used it as a safe way to cut heroin, or to welfare moms who paid him twenty cents on the dollar. If a woman walked away from her purse at a grocery store, it was his. If someone left their car unlocked near him, they would return to find their GPS and any spare change missing.</p><p>Orlando liked to think of himself as the Prince of Thieves. He didn&#x2019;t understand the literary reference to the nickname <i>the Impaler</i>, and no one bothered to explain it to him.</p><p>In August of last year, Orlando scooted out of a store with seven pairs of snowy-white Nikes, aluminum foil wrapped tightly around the sensors to prevent the pedestals from sounding. He ducked behind the store, on high alert for signs of pursuit, relaxing only when he realized no one was coming. He was shaking, not just from the adrenaline; the pipe was calling. Not just calling, but <i>singing</i>.</p><p>A beefy kid in his twenties emerged from behind a Dumpster, a store detective Orlando knew well, and who knew the meth addict just as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; Orlando said, bracing himself as the kid galloped in and tackled him. As they hit the pavement together, Orlando growled and bit the kid&#x2019;s arm.</p><p>The kid bit him back and damn near tore his right ear off.</p><p>Orlando shrieked and hammered at the store detective with his fists, squirming beneath his bulk and slipping free. The kid snarled, glassy-eyed with Orlando&#x2019;s blood smeared across his face, and the meth addict ran. He didn&#x2019;t care about Nikes anymore. The look on the kid&#x2019;s face held the promise of death beside a stinking Dumpster.</p><p>He made it seven blocks, stumbling along a sidewalk with both hands pressed to the dangling flap that had been his ear, blood streaking his neck and dampening his clothes. A police cruiser slid to the curb and the young officer inside immediately recognized Orlando. He leaped out of the cruiser and slammed Orlando to the ground, cuffing him. If Orlando Worthy was running and bleeding, he surmised, then he had been up to some illegal shit and that was probable cause enough. The young officer didn&#x2019;t want to hear his protests of innocence, cared nothing for the meth head&#x2019;s claims about a cannibalistic store detective. He took him to Enloe Medical Center.</p><p>Enloe folded within twelve hours.</p><p>When Orlando turned, he had a pressure bandage with heavy gauze wound around his head and was handcuffed to a bed rail in the emergency room. He tugged and rattled the cuff for five months before decay finally tightened his flesh enough to pull his hand free.</p><p>There was nothing left to eat in the hospital, so he wandered out.</p><p>Eventually he heard crows, understood that it meant meat, and made his way to the sound. When he reached the debris of the wrecked Black Hawk, he saw that another of his kind was already dangling out the cockpit as it fed. Orlando Worthy crawled up and in beside her, moaning as he pushed her over a bit so he could also reach the meal in the flight suit.</p><p>Sharon didn&#x2019;t appear to mind the company.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>They had both been dispatchers for Chico Emergency Services, Patty Phuong and Patty MacLaren. The first Patty was petite to the point of being childlike, the second a solid woman with red hair and a booming personality. Cops, firemen, and paramedics, without exception, called them Rice Patty and Patty Wagon. Neither woman took offense, and they even had coffee cups at their workstations bearing the nicknames.</p><p>Friends both on and off the clock, the two women no longer knew one another as they shuffled across the winter hay field, walking together by chance alone. Their uniforms hung in tatters and the flesh beneath was a speckled gray and maroon. Rice Patty had lost an eye and most of the flesh on one side of her face. Big Patty Wagon was missing her left arm at the shoulder, and her meaty body was peppered with blackened buckshot patterns.</p><p>The women began moaning as they neared the Black Hawk, spotting the figures already feeding there. Then their attention was drawn to the right as a pair of indignant crows, working at something on the ground, took flight in a flurry of black feathers. Rice Patty and Patty Wagon lurched over to see what the birds had been eating.</p><p>It was the lower torso of a woman, hips and legs only, with burned fatigues tucked into combat boots. The crash had pitched this bloody mass thirty feet away from the helicopter. The two Pattys dropped to all fours and began to feed, side by side.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Along the length of Mulberry Street in Chico, drifters wandered with arms dangling at their sides, shuffling through blown trash and dropped luggage and abandoned cars. They moved beneath darkened traffic signals and past houses and businesses with broken windows and kicked-in doors. Spray-painted signs, messages to family members about whether someone was alive and where they had gone, marred walls and pavement. A drifter locked in the backseat of a patrol car pressed its rotting face against the glass and pounded a fist with a steady rhythm. Black, crispy shapes moved through the skeletal remains of a burned movie theater, and things dressed in the baggy clothes and knit caps of hipsters walked stiffly along the paths of Chico State University.</p><p>Coyotes loped through the quiet streets. Sometimes they fed, sometimes they were fed upon.</p><p>A single rifle shot echoed through the bare limbs of winter trees, and a V of honking Canada geese passed high overhead. The wind blew newspapers and foam cups down boulevards of stopped vehicles, and whistled through the space left between a pair of municipal trucks parked nose to nose in an attempt to block a street. Drifters wearing summer clothes shuffled around the ends of the trucks and kept going with no particular destination in mind.</p><p>Along Vallombrosa Avenue, where it ran alongside Bidwell Park, crows perched on the wooden crosspieces of the tall, heavy crucifixes planted there, picking at the flesh of still-moving corpses lashed and nailed to the wood in a line that stretched for three blocks. Occasionally a crow would get careless and a head would snap over, teeth crunching down on bone and feathers. For the most part, the birds were clever enough to stay clear of the bite.</p><p>The wind ruffled the clothing and hair of the crucified, carrying their moans away.</p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>August&#x2014;Sacramento</p><p>It was two minutes past six when Dean West let himself into Premier Arms, deactivating the alarm and locking the doors behind him, switching on a few lights. Opening wasn&#x2019;t until nine, and Tony and Juan wouldn&#x2019;t be in until eight. The daycare offered early drop-off hours, which worked well as Leah was an early riser, and so Dean looked forward to a couple hours of solitude before the actual workday began. He was restoring an M-1 Garand, the standard-issue rifle of World War II GIs, and the quiet would allow him to give the old weapon the attention it deserved.</p><p>Dean was thirty-three and fit, hardened by his former military service, and maintained by five days a week at the gym, plus racquetball. He had to stay in shape to keep up with his wife, a fitness junkie. Not that he minded her dedication...</p></p><h2>2018 Waggoner Cruising Guide</h2><p>The 2018 Waggoner Cruising Guide includes the most comprehensive and up-to-date information from Olympia, WA to Ketchikan, AK.

Pendell&#x2019;s vision is all encompassing&#x2014;he describes the rising seas&#x2019; impact on countries and continents around the world. But his imaginative storytelling focuses on California. A &#x201c;great bay&#x201d; forms in California&#x2019;s Central Valley and expands during a 16,000-year period. As the years pass, and technology seems to regress, even memory of a &#x201c;precollapse&#x201d; world blends into myth. Grizzly bears and other large predators return to the California hills, and civilization reverts to a richly imagined medieval society marked by guilds and pilgrimages, followed even later by hunting and gathering societies. Pendell&#x2019;s focus is on the lives of people struggling with love, wars, and physical survival thousands of years in California&#x2019;s future. He deftly mixes poetic imagery, news-reporting-style writing, interviews with survivors, and maps documenting the geographic changes. In the end, powerful human values that have been with us for 40,000 years begin to reemerge and remind us that they are desperately needed&#x2014;in the present.</p><p>Dale Pendell is a widely published author and poet.

What was going on? The fourteen-year-old boy she and her husband had called "Rover" was supposed to be dead. She couldn't dump his body if he wasn't!<br><br>What should she do? She gripped the steering wheel so hard her knuckles showed beneath her skin. She needed to stop and see what was going on. How had someone who'd been <em>killed </em>come back to life? And was Rover merely in a panic because he'd regained consciousness in a dark, confined space? Or was he trying to knock out a taillight in hopes of gaining the attention of the car following behind?<br><br>She couldn't believe he was still breathing, let alone coherent enough to execute such a plan. He was too young to be that smart, too scared to defy them. But&#x2014;if he was alive&#x2014;Rover had to know this was the end. He'd never see his parents again if he didn't do <em>something. </em>Wouldn't that make him willing to take <em>any </em>risk?<br><br>Tiffany wasn't sure. It always astonished her how cowed and controllable the teenagers her husband brought home really were. Colin had a way with them, knew just the type of individual to pick.<br><br>Another <em>thunk </em>caused her palms to grow slick with sweat. Damn it! This wasn't supposed to happen. It'd certainly never happened before.<br><br>Could anyone else hear the racket Rover was making?<br><br>She glanced in her rearview mirror. The black SUV that'd been following her for the past few miles was still there. The driver, a middle-aged woman wearing sunglasses, had lowered her window to take advantage of the warm spring weather. The wind blew her dark hair back, revealing an oval face with full lips, the kind of face Colin would probably find attractive, despite the obvious age difference. But the woman didn't look any more interested in Tiffany than she had before.<br><br>Or maybe she was. She seemed closer now....<br><br>More movement, sounds of distress, drew Tiffany's nerves taut. <em>I've got to pull over.</em><br><br>But if the driver of the SUV had seen or heard anything unusual, she might stop, too. And how would Tiffany explain having a boy in her trunk? Especially one in Rover's condition?<br><br><em>Think! </em>It was better to keep driving. She'd turn at the next light and hope the SUV went straight. There were several ways to get to Highway 50. Once out of the city, beyond Placerville, she could pull down a dirt road in the mountains where she'd be hidden by pine trees.<br><br>But then what? It was one thing to dump a body, another to be the reason that person was no longer living.<br><br>The noise coming from her trunk became louder, more insistent. If the lady behind her didn't hear it, a pedestrian at the next crosswalk could.<br><br>Tiffany drew in a deep breath. She had to get this right or Colin would be upset. And if she screwed up, they'd both go to prison.<br><br>Heart hammering, she reached into her purse and fumbled around until she located her cell and managed to push the speed-dial button that would ring her husband's cell.<br><br>"Hello?"<br><br>"Colin, he's alive!" she blurted into the pause that followed, but then his recorded voice cut in and she realized she'd gotten his voice mail.<br><br>"I'm afraid I'm not able to take your call right now..."<br><br>Frustrated, she punched the End button. Colin thought it was funny to bait people into believing they had him on the phone. She usually laughed when he caught her on it. But she wasn't laughing today. She needed him. <em>Now.</em><br><br>"H-e-l-p! Mo-om? Da-ad? Someone <em>help </em>me!"<br><br>That was Rover screaming!<br><br>Taking the next right, Tiffany gave her car too much gas. When the tires squealed, two men leaving Lamps Plus looked up, and she regretted her lead foot. She didn't want to draw attention to herself.<br><br>At least the black SUV continued down Madison. That was a small relief.<br><br>Her hand shook as she dialed Colin's work number. "Come on, hurry. I need to talk to my husband," she muttered through the subsequent ringing.<br><br>Finally, Misty, the receptionist with the frizzy red hair, picked up. "Scovil, Potter &amp; Clay Law Offices."<br><br>"M-Misty? This is Tiffany Bell. Is my husband there?"<br><br>"Let me see." There was a long pause. Then she came back on the line. "He's in a meeting."<br><br>"Will you get him for me?"<br><br>"He's with the boss."<br><br>As a new hire only a year out of law school, Colin had to be careful to keep the other lawyers happy, especially Walter Scovil, the most senior of the senior partners. But nothing was more important than this.<br><br>"I'm sorry, it's an emergency."<br><br>"Oh! Is everything okay?"<br><br>Hoping to stanch the tears burning behind her eyes, Tiffany blinked repeatedly. "His, um, his mother fell and... and she's hurt."<br><br>Colin hated his mother, wouldn't have walked across the street to see her even if she was on her deathbed, but most people didn't know that. It wasn't something he typically shared. They both knew what other people would think if they heard him calling his mother the names he used.<br><br>"I feel terrible," the receptionist said. "I'll get him for you."<br><br>The stoplight ahead turned red, and traffic in front of Tiffany began to slow. She studied the intersection, wondering if she could switch into the right-hand-turn lane, or catch a green arrow on the left. Anything to avoid coming to a complete stop. But too many vehicles blocked the way. She had no choice but to wait for the light.<br><br>Biting her lip, she eased her foot onto the brake... and let her breath go only when she didn't hear a peep from Rover. Did that mean he'd died?<br><br>"Tiffany, why are you calling?"<br><br>At the sound of her husband's voice, she lost the battle she'd been fighting with her emotions. As she wiped the tears rolling down her cheeks, she saw the man in the truck next to her staring and averted her eyes. "It's Rover," she whispered into the phone.<br><br>"What's wrong?"<br><br>"He's <em>alive."</em><br><br><em>"What?"</em><br><br>"He's alive!"<br><br>"He can't be."<br><br>"He <em>is. </em>He's in the trunk banging around and crying for help."<br><br>"Then pull over and take care of it!"<br><br>"Here? In the middle of Fair Oaks?"<br><br>"Shit! No, of course not." He was silent for a few seconds. "What street are you on?"<br><br>"I'm heading south on Hazel, trying to reach Highway 50."<br><br>"Wait until you get out of town, then pull over and deal with the problem."<br><br>She'd figured out that much. It was what came next that made her uneasy. "What do you mean, 'deal with the problem'?"<br><br>He kept his response low. "Just what I said. Finish the job."<br><br>Kill Rover? Herself? Her stomach flip-flopped at the thought. The boy had been Colin's toy; the cleanup should be Colin's job. "But... I don't have a weapon."<br><br>"Use a piece of wood or... or a rock if you have to. It's not hard."<br><br>Tiffany's jaw went slack. How had what'd started as a little fun grown into this? Sometimes, lying awake at night, she couldn't believe how badly their lives were spinning out of control. And yet she didn't know how to stop it. Colin didn't even want to try. He was too addicted to the adrenaline rush, to the sexual excitement, to the power, and he'd sucked her in with him by repeating the same old promise, "Just one more time. I'll quit after this."<br><br>Now she wasn't only participating in a peripheral way; she was tying up his loose ends. "You're kidding, right? You know I don't have the nerve for... for <em>that."</em><br><br>"You don't have a choice!"<br><br>The light turned green. The guy in the truck next to her gave her an appreciative smile as they both accelerated, but she wasn't worried that he'd suspect her of any wrongdoing. Rover hadn't made a sound for several minutes. "But&#x2014;"<br><br>"Do it, or I swear to God, Tiffany..."<br><br>He didn't finish. He didn't have to. She knew what he'd be like if she didn't fix this. He'd punish <em>her </em>now that he no longer had his "pet."<br><br>"Okay. I got it. I&#x2014;he's not moving anymore."<br><br>"So you called me for nothing?" He sighed into the phone. "You're pathetic."<br><br>"How can you say that after everything I've done for you?"<br><br>"Don't start. You wouldn't be anything without me. You were a fat slob when I met you." He lowered his voice further, but she figured he had to be in his office with the door closed or he wouldn't have spoken as freely as he had. "There wasn't a guy in high school who'd even <em>look </em>at you, with your greasy hair and filthy clothes. And now all my friends drool when you walk by. <em>I've </em>turned you into a pinup. <em>I've </em>taught you how to take care of yourself."<br><br>Unfortunately, taking care of herself proved to be an ongoing effort. He demanded she work out two hours a day. He weighed her regularly and monitored every morsel she put in her mouth. He wanted her at a steady hundred and twenty pounds, with breasts the size of watermelons, he said. But she wasn't quite that large. Fortunately, Colin was more concerned with keeping up appearances than fulfilling his porn-star fantasy, which tempered what he'd had the plastic surgeon do to her body. In the end, he'd settled for an augmentation that made her a full D cup, and he had her nose fixed and her cheekbones enhanced. They still owed over nine thousand dollars to Visa for those improvements, but he didn't seem to care about the expense. He loved that they were the most admired couple in the firm and in the neighborhood.<br><br>"What other men think doesn't concern me," she said, and it was true. He was the only person who mattered in the world, the only one who'd ever loved her. She didn't want to lose that.<br><br>"If I mean so damn much to you, do what you have to do!"<br><br>Without any recent noise from the vicinity of the trunk, Tiffany was feeling more confident. She rolled down her window to let some cool air into the car and pulled her sweat-soaked blouse away from her body. "Yes. Of course. I've got it."<br><br>"That's better."<br><br>The entrance to Highway 50 came up on her right, and she accelerated onto the on-ramp. It would be hard for anyone to hear Rover once she was on the freeway. "It just scared me for a minute, that's all."<br><br>"I know, babe. But you're stronger than you realize. You belong to me, don't you? Every thought you think, every move you make, all comes from me, and I've trained you well."<br><br>She knew he was too possessive, but she considered herself lucky. It made her feel attractive, desired, secure in his love. He took her to the tattoo parlor every once in a while to have his name tattooed on a different part of her body. So far, both breasts, her ass and the inside of her thighs said, "Colin's." But she didn't mind. He wouldn't bother with the time and expense involved if she wasn't an important part of his life. Only people who tried to contest his will ran into problems.<br><br>Shivering, she remembered the incident that had finally brought their relationship with Rover to an end. It was the boy's own fault, she told herself. He knew Colin, knew what he demanded. If Rover had obeyed, as usual, it might've hurt for a while but he would've recovered. There wouldn't have been any reason to kill him.<br><br>Instead, she was driving to a remote location to dump his corpse.<br><br>"What should we have for dinner tonight?" she asked, hoping a change in topic would make Colin respond favorably.<br><br>"I don't know. I have to get back to that meeting."<br><br>"Okay." She was still on her own with this terrible assignment. But at least she'd been able to connect with Colin, to get instruction. "Good luck."<br><br>"Thanks for watching my back, Tiff. I'm gonna show you how much I love you tonight," he said and hung up.<br><br>She smiled as she dropped her phone in her purse. With Rover gone, they'd be alone at last, the way Tiffany liked it best. She knew she was stupid to get jealous of her husband's toys&#x2014;or pets, as he called them&#x2014;but she didn't like how much he seemed to enjoy some of the stuff he made them do. Especially the boys. They satisfied him more than she could, even with the fake boobs and the tattoos and the dangerous domination games they'd begun to play. Sometimes she got the impression she was just for looks, part of his image, a trophy for his lawyer friends to envy.<br><br>But that couldn't be true. Colin shared everything with her, including his pets. Rover had been doing the housework for weeks.<br><br>Drying her tears, she turned up the volume on the radio and began to sing along. This wouldn't be difficult. She'd head past the rented cabin where they'd once spent Thanksgiving before Colin's dad had bought his own place. Then she'd pull deep into the woods and roll the body out onto the ground. When that was done, she'd drive to the grocery store and get the ingredients to make her husband a romantic dinner. She'd let Colin chain her up and whip her afterward, really get into it. If she was lucky, he'd forget all about Rover and forgive her for bothering him at the office.<br><br>She was almost herself by the time she found what appeared to be a safe location.

This updated and expanded edition features more than a hundred pages of fresh reporting and commentary, drawn from Friedman's travels around the world and across the American heartland--from anyplace where the flattening of the world is being felt.<br>In <i>The World Is Flat</i>, Friedman at once shows "how and why globalization has now shifted into warp drive" (Robert Wright, Slate) and brilliantly demystifies the new flat world for readers, allowing them to make sense of the often bewildering scene unfolding before their eyes. With his inimitable ability to translate complex foreign policy and economic issues, he explains how the flattening of the world happened at the dawn of the twenty-first century; what it means to countries, companies, communities, and individuals; how governments and societies can, and must, adapt; and why terrorists want to stand in the way. More than ever, <i>The World Is Flat</i> is an essential update on globalization, its successes and discontents, powerfully illuminated by one of our most respected journalists.<br><br></p><p><br>"One mark of a great book is that it makes you see things in a new way, and Mr. Friedman certainly succeeds in that goal," the Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz wrote in <i>The New York Times</i>, reviewing <i>The World Is Flat</i> in 2005. For this updated and expanded edition, Friedman has seen his own book in a new way, bringing fresh stories and insights to help us understand the flattening of the world. New material includes:<br><br>� The reasons why the flattening of the world "will be seen in time as one of those fundamental shifts or inflection points, like Gutenberg's invention of the printing press, the rise of the nation-state, or the Industrial Revolution"<br><br>� An explanation of "uploading" as one of the ten forces that are flattening the world, as blogging, open-source software, pooled knowledge projects like Wikipedia, and podcasting enable individuals to bring their experiences and opinions to the whole world <br><br>� A mapping of the New Middle--the places and spaces in the flat world where <br>middle-class jobs will be found--and portraits of the character types who will find success as New Middlers <br><br>�An account of the qualities American parents and teachers need to cultivate in young people so that they will be able to thrive in the flat world <br><br>�A call for a government-led "geo-green" strategy to preserve the environment and natural resources<br><br>�An account of the "globalization of the local": how the flattening of the world is actually strengthening local and regional identities rather than homogenizing the world <br><br>THE WORLD IS FLAT is Thomas Friedman&#39;s account of the great changes taking place in our time, as lightning-swift advances in technology and communication put people all over the globe in touch as never before-creating an explosion of wealth in India and China, and challenging the rest of us to run even faster just to stay in place.

Lee's defeat at Gettysburg had dashed the hopes of the Confederate army, and Grant's victory at Vicksburg had cut the South in two. <i>An Honorable Defeat</i> is the story of the four months that saw the surrender of the South and the assassination of Lincoln by Southern partisans. It is also the story of two men, antagonists yet political partners, who struggled during this time to achieve their own differing visions for the South: Jefferson Davis, the autocratic president of the Confederate States, who vowed never to surrender whatever the cost; and the practical and warm General John C. Breckinridge, Secretary of War, who hoped pragmatism would save the shattered remnants of the land he loved so dearly. <br><br>Pulitzer Prize nominee William C. Davis traces the astounding flight of these men, and the entire Confederate cabinet, as they flee south from Richmond by train, then by mule, then on foot. Using original research, he narrates, with dramatic style and clear historical accuracy, the futile quarrels of Davis and Breckinridge as they try to evade bands of Northern pursuers and describes their eventual--and separate--captures. The result is a rich canvas of a time of despair and defeat that is exciting and highly readable, a charged tale full of physical adventure and political battle that sweeps from the marble halls of Richmond to a dingy room in a Havana hotel. <br> <br></p><p>In the final days of the Civil War, when defeat loomed for the South, Confederate Secretary of War John C. Breckenridge warned, "This has been a magnificent epic. In God's name, let it not terminate in a farce." To be sure, there were plenty of farcical moments--even pathetic ones--as the Confederate government breathed its last. President Jefferson Davis fled capture but was ultimately apprehended in disguise; he was wearing his wife's clothing. Union soldiers detected his "distinctly unfeminine cavalry boots and spurs" and arrested him. Then there was "the last official act of the Confederate government itself"--Breckinridge giving a commission in jest to a soldier who had already surrendered because the man wanted to outrank one of his fellows. <p> William C. Davis is the perfect author for <i>An Honorable Defeat</i>. He is an accomplished Civil War historian and previously has written excellent biographies of Jefferson Davis and John Breckinridge, the two figures who dominate this book. It also serves as a fitting bookend to <i>A Government of Our Own,</i> an earlier volume on the birth of the Confederate government. <i>An Honorable Defeat</i> is an absorbing story of desperation, as President Davis contemplates waging a guerrilla war against the North and continues to believe the South can prevail even when its mighty armies have been reduced to almost nothing. "A narrow divide separates heroic commitment from sheer fanaticism," writes the author, who nevertheless defends Davis against the charge of fanaticism. He shows, for example, that Davis almost certainly was not aware of any plot on the life of Abraham Lincoln--even though one obviously existed and elements of his secret service probably encouraged it. On the whole, the Confederate president comes off as a man ill-suited to the task that confronted him, which, in time, included graceful surrender. Breckinridge, by contrast, emerges as a hero who made decisions in those last hours that saved lives and fostered national reconciliation. This is a fine book on an overlooked episode, and fans of Jay Winik's masterful <i>April 1865</i> will find that it deepens their understanding of how the Civil War came to a close. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>The author of more than forty books, William C. Davis is Director of Programs at the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies. He is also chief consultant for the A&amp;E television series <i>Civil War Journal </i>and teaches history at Virginia Tech.

Although these first Tennesseans boasted a cultural heritage of thousands of years, only three centuries of contact with the white man elapsed before their population was decimated and the remnants driven out. The Indians were a settled people when de Soto visited, not the savage or exotic woods creatures so often depicted. Tennessee s Indian Peoples, then, is a story of men and women human beings. Author, Ronald N. Satz tells how the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Creeks, Shawnees, and other Indian peoples lived, reared families, farmed and hunted, worshipped, played, fought, and governed themselves. He describes also the eventful destruction of their societies destroyed not only by external pressures for Indian lands, but also by internal change wrought by increasing dependence on the white man s trade goods. <br>Ronald N. Satz is Dean of Graduate Studies and University Research and teaches history at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

B. White was obeying that oft-repeated maxim: &#39;Write what you know.&#39; Helpless pigs, silly geese,clever spiders, greedy rats - White knew all of these characters in the barns and stables where he spent his favourite hours as child and adult. Painfully shy, White once wrote of himself &#39;this boy felt for animals a kinship he never felt for people&#39;. Nonetheless, that tens of millions have been so moved by Charlotte&#39;s Web, and by White&#39;s other classics, testifies to his deep understanding of the human condition. Bringing readers into intimate contact with E. B. White&#39;s world, Michael Sims chronicles his animal-rich youth and dreams of being a writer; the vibrant early years of the New Yorker,where urban nature was White&#39;s ever-present theme; the discovery of the farm in Maine where he and his wife would live; his fascinating scientific research into how spiders spin webs, lay eggs, and live in the world; his friendship with his legendary editor, Ursula Nordstrom; and the luminous creative process that led to publication of his masterpiece. By refining the raw ore of his childhood in Mount Vernon, New York, in the first decade of the twentieth century, White translated his own passions and contradictions, delights and fears, into a book that would be read the world over. The Story of Charlotte&#39;s Web illuminates the life of a literary icon, and will add richness and appreciation for anyone who has loved, or has yet to read, a cherished classic.</p><p>Michael Sims is the author of the acclaimed Apollo&#39;s Fire: A Day on Earth in Nature and Imagination, Adam&#39;s Navel: A Natural and Cultural History of the Human Form, and editor of the recent Dracula&#39;s Guest: A Connoisseur&#39;s Collection of Victorian Vampire Stories and The Penguin Book of Gaslight Crime.

Not only an engaging account of White&#39;s rise to literary prominence, through the New Yorker, but also his shyness, his awkwardness in love, his devotion to his wife, Katharine, and something else, something hard to identify but ever-present in the book, like the chirping of birds high in the trees at evening * Wall Street Journal * The gentle, loving book White deserves ... There is so much to celebrate in Sims&#39;s book. His own descriptions of nature are evocative and subtle, and he probes at White&#39;s psyche without raking him over the coals.

White fans will savour this, as will anyone wondering how an author is made, and how a book comes to life * Scotsman * Sims gives White and his story a bright new light ...

Sims illuminates an era of journalism and essay-writing through the war. His style also sings in tune with White&#39;s lyricism, especially in descriptions of nature and the farm * Sunday Times * A full, engaging account ...

Best of all, this book is likely to encourage readers to experience the pleasures of White&#39;s novel all over again * Los Angeles Times * Immensely charming * Boston Globe * A fascinating insight into the writing process and crushing refutation of any claim that writing for children is easy.

From West Point to the daring military actions that propelled him to the rank of general at age twenty-three to his unlikely romance with Libbie Bacon, Custer's exploits are the stuff of legend.</p><p>Always leading his men from the front with a personal courage seldom seen before or since, he was a key part of nearly every major engagement in the east. Not only did Custer capture the first battle flag taken by the Union Army and receive the white flag of surrender at Appomattox, but his field generalship at Gettysburg against Confederate cavalry General Jeb Stuart had historic implications in changing the course of that pivotal battle.</p><p>For decades, historians have looked at Custer strictly through the lens of his death on the frontier, his last stand, casting him as a failure. While some may say that the events that took place at the Little Big Horn are illustrative of America's bloody westward expansion, they have in the process unjustly eclipsed Custer's otherwise extraordinarily life and outstanding career and fall far short of encompassing his incredible service to his country. This biography of thundering cannons, pounding hooves, and stunning successes tells the true story of the origins of one of history's most dynamic and misunderstood figures. Award-winning historian Thom Hatch reexamines Custer's early career to rebalance the scales and show why Custer's epic fall could never have happened without the spectacular rise that made him an American legend.</p></p><p>THOM HATCH is the author of eight books, including <i>The Last Outlaws: The Lives and Legends of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> and <i>The Custer Companion: A Comprehensive Guide to the Life of George Armstrong Custer and the Plains Indians Wars</i>.

The Creek Indians of Alabama, escaped black slaves, and Muskogee-speaking natives of Florida together made up the tribe which took its name from the Spanish word for fugitives or wild men. They were united by a fierce independence and were led by a man of great natural gifts, as varied in his background as the tribe he led -- named Billy Powell at birth, known to history as Osceola. His story, stirring and sad in equal measure, is now told by Thom Hatch in his new history of the Seminole ordeal.&#x201d; &#x2015;Thomas Powers, Los Angeles Times Book Prize Winner and National Book Critics Circle Finalist for The Killing of Crazy Horse on Osceoloa and the Great Seminole War</p></p><h2>Industrial Revolutionaries: The Making of the Modern World 1776-1914</h2><p>In this vivid, sweeping history of the industrial revolution, Gavin Weightman shows how, in less than one hundred and fifty years, an unlikely band of scientists, spies, entrepreneurs, and political refugees took a world made of wood, powered by animals, wind, and water, and made it into something entirely new, forged of steel and iron, and powered by steam and fossil fuels. Weightman weaves together the dramatic stories of giants such as Edison, Watt, Wedgwood, and Daimler, with lesser-known or entirely forgotten characters, including a group of Japanese samurai who risked their lives to learn the secrets of the West, and John Iron Mad&#x201d; Wilkinson, who didn&#x2019;t let war between England and France stop him from plumbing Paris. Distilling complex technical achievements, outlandish figures, and daring adventures into an accessible narrative that spans the globe as industrialism spreads, <i>The Industrial Revolutionaries</i> is a remarkable work of original, engaging history.</p><p>Gavin Weightman is a social historian whose books focus on the origins of modern society. He is the author of the best-selling London&#39;s Thames, The Frozen Water Trade, and Signor Marconi&#39;s Magic Box.<b>Entertaining and informative</b>.&#x201d; John Steele Gordon, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br> Abraham Gesner is hardly a household name today, but this country-doctor-turned-geologist in Nova Scotia was the first person to transform the raw sludge of fossil remains into kerosene and other fuels. Gesner is but one of the fascinating characters Gavin Weightman brings to life in <i>The Industrial Revolutionaries</i>, his <b>engaging</b> survey of the countless men and women who wedded technological innovation to capitalist profit or nationalist agenda, and in the process helped usher in the modern era. Weightman believes the industrial revolution was an incremental process in which credit for any innovation or invention rightly belongs to innumerable individuals scattered throughout the world. He is remarkably successful at capturing this process, skillfully stitching together thumbnail sketches of a large number of inventors, architects, engineers, and visionaries. <b>Weightman expertly marshals his cast of characters across continents and centuries, forging a genuinely global history that brings the collaborative, if competitive, business of industrial innovation to life.</b>&#x201d; Stephen Mihm, The New York Times Book Review<br><br> Refreshingly old-fashioned . . . In this lively study, there is little room for the dry academic prose that so often makes economic histories a painful reading experience. Instead we have a wealth of vivid portraits of figures from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. . . . Weightman is excellent at demolishing some of the myths of the industrial revolution.&#x201d; Leo McKinstry, Literary Review<br><br> The author of some fine business histories, Weightman elevates his game in this work. ... Integrating lively biography with technological clarity, Weightman converts the Industrial Revolution into an enjoyably readable period of history." <i>Booklist</i><br><br> [Weightman&#x2019;s] enthusiasm for his subjects, and his insistence that the Industrial Revolution was the doing of more than a handful of Great Men, propels the book forward. It's one that anyone with a passing interest in economic history will thoroughly enjoy.&#x201d; <i>The Seattle Times</i><br><br> It is one of the pleasures of Weightman&#x2019;s book to see how technology rose above nationality. . . .

This is classic McCall Smith-clever, witty and entertaining- and beautifully illustrated.

Or Is He? <br><br></b>Pat saw Bruce at ten o&#x2019;clock on a Saturday morning, or at least that is when she thought she saw him. An element of doubt there certainly was. This centred not on the time of the sighting, but on the identity of the person sighted; for this was one of those occasions when one wonders whether the eye, or even the memory, has played a trick. And such tricks can be extraordinary, as when one is convinced that one has seen the late General de Gaulle coming out of a cinema, or when, against all reasonable probability, one thinks one has spotted Luciano Pavarotti on a train between Glasgow and Paisley; risible events, of course, but ones which underline the proposition that one&#x2019;s eyes are not always to be believed. <br><br>She saw Bruce while she was travelling on a bus from one side of Edinburgh &#x2013; the South Side, where she now lived &#x2013; to the New Town, on the north side of the city, where she worked three days a week in the gallery owned by her boyfriend, Matthew. The bus had descended with lumbering stateliness down the Mound, past the National Gallery of Scotland, and had turned into Hanover Street, narrowly missing an insouciant pedestrian at the corner. Pat had seen the near-miss &#x2013; it was by the merest whisker, she thought &#x2013; and had winced, but it was just at that moment, as the bus laboured up Hanover Street towards the statue of George IV, that she saw a young man walking in the opposite direction, a tall figure with Bruce&#x2019;s characteristic en brosse hairstyle and wearing precisely the sort of clothes that Bruce liked to wear on a Saturday: a rugby jersey celebrating Scotland&#x2019;s increasingly ancient Triple Crown victory and a pair of stone-coloured trousers. <br><br>Her eye being caught by the rugby jersey and the stone-coloured trousers, she turned her head sharply. Bruce! But now she could see only the back of his head, and after a moment she could not see even that; Bruce, or his double, had merged into a knot of people standing on the corner of Princes Street and Pat lost sight of him. She looked ahead. The bus would stop in a few yards; she could disembark and make her way down to Princes Street to see if it really was him. But then she reminded herself that if she did that she would arrive late at the gallery, and Matthew needed her to be there on time; he had stressed that. He had an appointment, he said, with a client who was proposing to place several important Colourist pictures on the market. She did not want to hold him up, and quite apart from that there was the question of whether she would want to see Bruce, even if it proved to be him. She thought on balance that she did not. <br><br>Bruce had been her flatmate when she had first moved into 44 Scotland Street. At first, she had been rather in awe of him &#x2013; after all, he was so confident in his manner, so self-assured &#x2013; and she at the time had been so much more diffident. Then things had changed. Bruce was undoubtedly good-looking &#x2013; a fact of which he was fully aware and of which he was very willing to take advantage; he knew very well that women found him attractive, and he assumed that Pat would prove no exception. Unfortunately, it transpired that he was right, and Pat found herself drawn to Bruce in a way which she did not altogether like. All this could have become very messy, but at the last moment, before her longing had been translated into anything beyond mere looking, she had come to her senses and decided that Bruce was an impossible narcissist. She fought to free herself of his spell, and she did. And then, having lost his job at the firm of surveyors (after being seen enjoying an intimate lunch in the Caf� St Honor� with the wife of the firm&#x2019;s senior partner), Bruce decided that Edinburgh was too small for him and had moved to London. People who do that often then discover that London is too big for them, much to the amusement of those who stayed behind in Edinburgh in the belief that it was just the right size. This sometimes leads to the comment that the only sensible reason for leaving Scotland for London was to take up the job of prime minister, a remark that might have been made by Samuel Johnson, had he not been so prejudiced on this particular matter and thought quite the opposite. <br><br>Pat had been relieved that Bruce had gone to London, and it had not occurred to her that he might return. It did not matter much to her, of course, as she moved in different circles from those frequented by Bruce, and she would not have to mix with him even if he did return. But at the same time she felt slightly unsettled by the possible sighting, especially as the experience made her feel an indefinable excitement, an increase in heart rate, that was not altogether welcome. Was it just the feeling one gets on meeting with an old lover, years afterwards? Try as one might to treat such occasions as ordinary events, there is a thrill which marks them out from the quotidian. And that is what Pat felt now. <br><br>She completed the rest of the bus journey down to Dundas Street in a thoughtful state. She imagined what she might say if she were to meet him and what he in turn might say to her. Would he have been improved by living in London, or would he have become even worse? It was difficult to tell. There must be those for whom living in London is an enriching experience, and there must be those who are quite unchanged by it. Pat had a feeling that Bruce would not have learned anything, as he had never shown any signs of learning anything when he was in Edinburgh. He would just be Bruce. <br><br>She got off her bus a few steps from Matthew&#x2019;s gallery. Through the window, she saw Matthew at his desk, immersed in paperwork. She looked at him fondly from a distance: dear Matthew, she thought; dear Matthew, in your distressed-oatmeal sweater, so ordinary, so safe; fond thoughts, certainly, but unaccompanied by any quickening of the pulse.</p><h2>Mr. Piper and His Cubs</h2><p>Updated with a new chapter by Bill Piper, Jr. who looks back and then updates us with a review of events since the original publication.

He has lectured widely in Europe, Africa, and the United States on his <i>Black Indians, Black Women of the Old West,</i> and <i>The Black West.</i>Grade 7-9-In a clear, straightforward style, Katz describes the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys (covering Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri) by African Americans seeking freedom, including biographical sketches of men and women who formed churches, started schools, or were politically active in their region. Some of these settlers were fugitive slaves; several set up stations on the Underground Railroad with the aid of the Quakers; others were farmers, poets, and soldiers. In several states, they helped form black regiments in the Civil War. Chronologically arranged, the book introduces many lesser-known personages not found in most collective biographies and places them in a broader context of U.S. history as a whole. Students or teachers might want to use this title as a starting point for further research.

Kolarich blames himself not only for the deaths of his wife and child, but for the informant's murder as well. He can't bring back his family, but he can find out who killed Ramirez and bring the killer to justice. <br><br> Unfortunately, Kolarich's guns-blazing approach to justice lands him smack in the middle of an FBI probe of a deeply corrupt governor and his cronies. To avoid jail, Kolarich must enter a world of wiretaps, double-dealing, and kickbacks, where he soon discovers that the murder of his informant was only the tip of the iceberg. <br><br> This breach of trust runs up to the highest levels of power, and exposing it may drag Kolarich into the fight of his life.</p><p>David Ellis is the author of seven novels, including <i>Line of Vision</i> for which he won the Edgar Award.

Ellis, the prosecutor who convicted former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, routinely turns these real-life dramas into compelling fiction. In his sixth novel, the Edgar winner gives us young criminal lawyer Jason Kolarich, about to settle into a career defending awful people with money. Then something horrible happens to his family. Trying to learn more, he takes a job on the governor&#x2019;s staff. Now he&#x2019;s surrounded by reptiles who rattle on about downstate poll numbers so they can keep the posts that let them steal the state blind.

There&#x2019;s sex, suspense, and blood here, but it&#x2019;s Ellis&#x2019; insider knowledge of this corrupt-wheels-within-corrupt-wheels world that sparks his narrative. He knows that power often goes to the wrong people because they&#x2019;re the ones who want it, and he turns that knowledge into penetrating legal fiction reminiscent of George V.

The ensign was dead. Skin blue-white. Body locked in a final contortion of pain. </p><p> Kirk faltered. He was twenty-four years old, a lieutenant three years out of the Academy. Ensign Galt had been only nineteen. On his first mission. He had looked up to Kirk, and Kirk hadn't protected him. </p><p> The communicator at Kirk's side chirped and reflexes took over, freeing him to act. He snapped it open. </p><p> "Kirk here." </p><p> "Where are those coordinates?" </p><p> It was Garrovick. Kirk's captain hadn't beamed back to the <i>Farragut</i> when he had had the chance, before the transporter coils had overloaded. He had stayed with the wounded. Waiting for the shuttlecraft. Still ten minutes away. </p><p> "Scanning now," Kirk said. He forced himself to his feet, exposing himself to whatever lay beyond the boulder. Whatever had attacked the <i>Farragut.</i> Whatever dwelt among the ashes of Tycho IV and was now picking off the <i>Farragut</i>'s crew, one by one. </p><p> Kirk held his bulky tricorder before him like a shield. His eyes darted from the readout to the surrounding terrain and back again. Tycho Prime was setting. The horizon blazed with the color of blood. But there were no readings. </p><p> "Captain, there's nothing out there!" Kirk's voice betrayed the tension he felt. </p><p> But the voice on the communicator remained calm. "Stay put and keep scanning, Lieutenant. You've got forward fire control till the main sensors are back in operation." </p><p> "Aye, sir," Kirk acknowledged. In standard orbit above him, the <i>Farragut</i>'s weapons were at his command. With no sensors to guide them, Kirk was now their targeting system. Somehow, the weight of that responsibility felt good. </p><p> A distant scream cut through the dusk, ending too abruptly. High-pitched. A woman. </p><p> Kirk held his position, heart hammering. He fought the urge to throw down his communicator and draw the laser pistol at his side. Garrovick had given him his orders, and there was nothing Kirk wouldn't do for his captain. </p><p> Garrovick was that kind of commander. That kind of man. </p><p> A figure ran for Kirk's boulder. It was nothing more than a red-tinged silhouette against the sunset. Kirk quickly checked his tricorder. The figure was human. </p><p> Androvar Drake. </p><p> The young lieutenant slid into position beside Kirk, out of breath, laser drawn. His short, bristle-cut blond hair was streaked with black volcanic ash. He glanced at Galt's body, but he showed no more reaction to it than a Vulcan might. </p><p> "That scream," Drake said, "it was Morgan." </p><p> Even as Kirk felt the shock twist through his chest, he saw the flicker of a smile on Drake's face. Faith Morgan was the <i>Farragut</i>'s weapons officer. For the last three months she had shared Kirk's quarters. As his lover. </p><p> Kirk wanted to grind Drake's smirk into the rocks of this place. </p><p> But he had his orders. Garrovick's orders. Starfleet orders. There was nothing more he could do for Faith Morgan, but the crew of the <i>Farragut</i> numbered four hundred. At least it <i>had,</i> when the ship had first entered this system. </p><p> Kirk waved his tricorder into the gloom. Still no readings. He felt angry tears sting his eyes, but he fought them back. </p><p> Before anything else, he was on duty. </p><p> Drake clicked through the power levels on his weapon, twisting the stubby barrel completely around to its highest setting. </p><p> Kirk reached out to stop him. "Lasers don't work on it." One of the sentries had managed to gasp that into her communicator before whatever it was had snuffed out her life. </p><p> "The creature can change its molecular form," Drake argued. "Maybe lasers can work on one form but not another." </p><p> Kirk rapidly changed the settings on his tricorder, scanned again, looking for a target. "Garrovick says <i>phasers</i> will do it." Phasers were the newest weapons in Starfleet's arsenal. </p><p> Drake gestured dismissively with his laser. "What does Garrovick know?" </p><p> Kirk slapped his communicator to his side, grabbed Drake by his collar, shoved him hard against the boulder. "He's the <i>captain,</i>" Kirk hissed. "He'll know how to get us out of this." As far as Kirk was concerned, that was what starship captains did. They were invincible. They had to be. </p><p> Drake looked amused by Kirk's emotional outburst. He smoothed his tunic where Kirk had crushed it. "He didn't do so well in orbit, did he?" </p><p> Kirk flipped open his communicator again, to keep his fist off Drake's jaw. Drake wasn't worth it. Kirk had found that out at Starfleet Academy. Their final after-class fight in the antigrav gym had cost Kirk two demerits. Kirk had won, barely. But the greater satisfaction had come when Kirk had edged out Drake by two percentiles and drawn first star duty in their class. </p><p> "Something caused a temporal shift in the sensor grid," Kirk said. It was the only explanation for how Garrovick had been taken by surprise. </p><p> Kirk had been on duty on the <i>Farragut</i>'s bridge when it had happened. The sensor boards had lit up as the ship had been invaded by...something -- a gas cloud, a creature? At the time there had been no way to be certain. </p><p> Garrovick had ordered shields to full strength. The creature responded by somehow vanishing from the sensors' sensitivity range. At the same time, an impossible temporal phase shift overloaded every key circuit in the <i>Farragut.</i> It might even have been a defensive move on the creature's part. But whatever had caused it, for a breathless hour it had seemed the ship might not be able to hold her orbit. </p><p> Garrovick had ordered the evacuation of all but a skeleton flight crew. Then he had saved the ship. Invincible. </p><p> But by then the creature had found the evacuation camp on the surface of Tycho IV. And it <i>was</i> a creature, there could be no doubt about that now. A creature that fed on the red blood cells of humanoid life-forms. Like Galt. And Faith. And all the others already cut down. </p><p> On the surface, the creature methodically probed their defenses. It overpowered their emergency forcefields. Withstood whatever the laser cannons could send into it. Enveloped everything with a sickly sweet smell -- the smell of death on an already dying world. </p><p> Immediately, Garrovick had beamed down to the heart of the action, organizing the withdrawal of his crew. Fighting at their side. </p><p> Then, suddenly, halfway through the boarding process, the ship's transporters had stopped functioning. Too strained by the temporal overload and the first evacuation. </p><p> Garrovick had called down the shuttlecraft. </p><p> No one believed they would make it in time. </p><p> But Kirk never doubted that Garrovick would save them. Somehow. </p><p> He was the <i>captain.</i> </p><p> Something spiked on the tricorder's display. </p><p> Kirk fine-tuned the reading. Di-kironium. It meant nothing to him. </p><p> But then an unwelcome fragrance reached out to him. Too sweet. Overpowering. </p><p> "It's coming back..." Kirk said. </p><p> "Lieutenant!" Garrovick transmitted. "Where are those readings?" </p><p> Something moved out by the distant rocks. </p><p> No -- not <i>moved</i> -- <i>billowed.</i> Roiled forward against the scarlet sunset like a storm front from hell. </p><p> "Kirk?!" Garrovick repeated. </p><p> It was at this moment, in another time, another life, that Lieutenant Kirk froze. Faced with certain death, weighed down by the responsibility of his duty, he hesitated. </p><p> But not this time. </p><p> "Kirk to <i>Farragut!</i>" he shouted. "Target bearing thirty meters due west this location! All phaser banks <i>FIRE!</i>" </p><p> Instinctively Kirk charged Drake, forcing him down to cover as well. A heartbeat later, the heavens of Tycho IV were ripped open by twin lances of blue fire. </p><p> Kirk felt the ground shake as the eerie harmonics of phased energy tore apart the atoms of everything in its beam. He smelled burnt dust, heat, the tang of ozone released by atmospheric ionization. </p><p> The barrage ended. </p><p> Kirk peered past the edge of the boulder. A cloud of dust was lit from within by the glow of superheated rocks. </p><p> The creature was gone. </p><p> "We did it," Kirk exulted. He brought his communicator closer. "Captain Garrovick -- we..." </p><p> A wispy tendril of white vapor twisted from the dust cloud like a tornado forming in reverse. </p><p> Kirk stopped talking. </p><p> The vapor stretched up from the ground, spinning faster, rising along the ionization trail left by the phaser beams. </p><p> Rising up to the <i>Farragut</i>. </p><p> "Dear God..." Kirk whispered. </p><p> He looked at Drake. Drake's eyes gleamed in the final trace of light from the sunset. His expression was unreadable. </p><p> "Kirk to <i>Farragut!</i> The creature is on an intercept course! Get out of there!" </p><p> Garrovick broke in on the transmission. "<i>Farragut!</i> Break orbit! Maximum warp! <i>Now!</i>" </p><p> The <i>Farragut</i>'s science officer responded, her voice breaking up in static. </p><p> "...shields down...coming in through...antimatter containment is..." </p><p> A new star blossomed directly overhead. </p><p> Garrovick said. "<i>Farragut,</i> come in..." </p><p> Nothing. Not even static. </p><p> Kirk stared up at the flickering pinpoint of light. Two hundred crew. A Constitution-class starship. Reduced to one dying star among so many. </p><p> Now obscured by a slender coil of white vapor. Spiraling down from the heavens. </p><p> Coming back to claim them all. </p><p> Drake laughed beside Kirk. "Great instincts, Jimbo. See you in hell." </p><p> The descending cloud creature was almost on them. Kirk had run out of options. There was only one thing left to do. </p><p> "End program," he said. </p><p> Then the creature and Drake and Tycho IV dissolved into a holographic haze, back to the past where they belonged... </p><p> ...and Kirk no longer did. </p><p> * * * </p><p> "Was the suit too heavy, sir?" The young Stafleet technician waited respectfully for Kirk's answer as Kirk slipped off the bulky encounter helmet he had worn during the simulation. </p><p> In the cavernous room in the subbasement of the Cochrane Physics Hall of Starfleet Academy, massive banks of machinery hummed. The unpainted, generic blocks and platform, that had recreated the rocky terrain of Tycho IV dutifully reset themselves into yellow-gridded walls. </p><p> Kirk's eyes ached where the visual input encoders had pressed against them. His back ached from the weight of the servo drivers that controlled the feedback web enclosing his body. The entire holoenvironment encounter rig <i>was</i> too heavy. </p><p> But Kirk wasn't going to be the one who complained about it. </p><p> He made a conscious effort to stand straighter, move his arms more quickly. He flashed a smile at the technician. "Felt fine," he said lightly. "Almost as if I were back in my old uniform." </p><p> The technician grinned, impressed. As if all he ever heard were complaints. He started disconnecting the feedback web. </p><p> "You know," the technician said as if Kirk were a familiar friend of his, "someday it should be possible to do away with the suit entirely. Use focused tractor beams. Microgravity control. Maybe even build some props with transporter matter replication." </p><p> Kirk groaned inwardly as he kept a patient smile on his face. In addition to its weight, the suit chafed in places he didn't want to rub with an audience around. </p><p> He let the technician babble on happily about the wondrous abilities of his gizmos and gadgets an the future of holographic simulations. </p><p> He hoped the technician would think the sweat streaming off his subject's forehead was the result of the encounter suit's skintight fit, and not the exertion that had left Kirk close to exhaustion. Or the pain in his shoulder not letting him forget the way he had hit the simulated ground and rolled behind the simulated boulder. </p><p> He thought it was too bad Starfleet engineers couldn't simulate the feeling of indestructibility he had had in his youth, when he could hit the real ground on a roll five times a day and never feel the consequences. </p><p> "Think of it," the technician continued with innocent enthusiasm. "Just walk into an empty room in your ordinary uniform and <i>zap!</i> Instantly you're surrounded by a holoenvironment so realistic you can't tell the difference between it and reality." </p><p> Kirk flexed his hands, remembering the weight of the old-fashioned tricorder he had carried during the simulation. The way the fabric around Drake's neck had compressed in his fist. All of it an illusion. </p><p> "Trust me. It's very realistic now," Kirk said. He meant it. </p><p> "So you can be sure that's what would have happened." </p><p> Kirk didn't understand. "What would have happened?" </p><p> "If you had fired at the cloud creature right away, instead of hesitating the way you really did." </p><p> Now Kirk understood. But he didn't want to talk about it. He hadn't thought about Faith Morgan in years. But he had never forgotten her. He would never forget any of them. </p><p> "You see, by not firing the phasers right away," the technician persisted, "the creature only attacked those crew members on the ground. The <i>Farragut</i> and everyone on her were safe. But if you had fired right away -- based on the computer's reconstruction of the cloud creature's abilities, it would have returned to the <i>Farragut,</i> destroyed her, <i>then</i> finished off everyone else on the ground as well. So you did the right thing the first time round." </p><p> And Garrovick had died because of it, Kirk thought grimly. He changed the subject. "It should make for a wonderful training device." </p><p> The technician gave him a bewildered look. "Training? I guess. But how about for entertainment? The gaming possibilities alone are endless." </p><p> Kirk kicked off the heavy feedback boots that had made him feel as if he had crunched across volcanic soil. "You programmed all this for 'entertainment' purposes?" he asked. </p><p> The technician retained his puzzled expression as he retrieved Kirk's feedback boots, balancing the entire suit in an awkward position across his arms. "Sir, we've programmed almost all your early exploits into the system." </p><p> "My exploits?" </p><p> The technician nodded ardently. "This encounter with the cloud creature of Tycho IV, and your destruction of it eleven years later on stardate 3619.2. And stardate 3045.6 -- remember? Your encounter with the Metrons and hand-to-hand battle with the Gorn. And 3468.1 -- when you escaped from the alien on Pollux IV who claimed to be the Greek god Adonais. We've almost got them all, sir. More coming online each day." </p><p> Kirk felt rattled. He couldn't recall a single stardate from his first five-year mission on the <i>Enterprise</i> if his pension depended on it. "But why?" </p><p> The technician stared blankly at Kirk, as if he couldn't understand why the question had been asked. "Sir...you're a hero." </p><p> "Oh." <i>That again,</i> Kirk tho...</p></p><h2>Tales of Manhattan</h2><p>Tales of Manhattan is divided into three parts with each story about a well-heeled resident of Manhattan-entrenched in power through family and money, these are the type of people that Louis Auchincloss understood, and chose to write penetrating stories about.

They lived a paradox--unwanted by a repressive Stalinist state, yet forbidden to leave. <i>When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone</i> is the astonishing and inspiring story of their rescue. <p></p> Journalist Gal Beckerman draws on newly released Soviet government documents as well as hundreds of oral interviews with refuseniks, activists, Zionist "hooligans," and Congressional staffers. He shows not only how the movement led to a mass exodus in 1989, but also how it shaped the American Jewish community, giving it a renewed sense of spiritual purpose and teaching it to flex its political muscle. He also makes a convincing case that the movement put human rights at the center of American foreign policy for the very first time, helping to end the Cold War. <p></p> In cinematic detail, the book introduces us to all the major players, from the flamboyant Meir Kahane, head of the paramilitary Jewish Defense League, to Soviet refusenik Natan Sharansky, who labored in a Siberian prison camp for over a decade, to Lynn Singer, the small, fiery Long Island housewife who went from organizing local rallies to strong-arming Soviet diplomats. This multi-generational saga, filled with suspense and packed with revelations, provides an essential missing piece of Cold War and Jewish history. <br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive Essay from Gal Beckerman, Author of <i>When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone</i></b> </p> <p>In the summer of 2006, I traveled to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Riga. I needed to see the places I was writing about in the book, even though no activists or refuseniks lived there any more. All my characters were long gone--the story itself was about their fight to leave. So besides talking with a few former dissidents and some Russian Jews who had stayed, it was mostly just a chance to get a better feel for the lost world in which my book takes place.</p> <p>And so I found myself standing outside the refusenik Volodya Slepak's apartment on what was once Gorky Street, now Tsverskaya. I stared up at the balcony where he and his wife Masha defiantly and illegally unfurled a banner in June 1978, demanding that they be allowed to join their son in Israel (he was one of the few who had managed to leave). Hundreds of people clogged Gorky Street and jeered at them. Eventually they were arrested and sentenced to three years of Siberian exile. The street had obviously changed. There were now flashing lights, expensive stores, and half-naked women on billboards. But it didn&#x2019;t take too much of a leap to picture the stately slate-gray building and the wide boulevard as it once was.</p> <p>Many times on that trip, I realized that all I had to do was mentally remove two or three elements from whatever landscape I was looking at, and I could imagine the place as it was. Occasionally, I would call refuseniks now living in Israel and ask them to describe over the phone some episode from their life and where it had taken place--a square where a protest was held or the government office where they were finally handed an exit visa after a dozen years of being denied. Except for a few changed street names, they could usually describe everything about a given location. The past, I understood, was still fresh. Somehow it made the history that much more powerful--to think that not so long ago these things happened here, that good people were arrested for nothing.</p> <p>One place that definitely hadn't changed was Rumbuli, where the book begins. It was here, in 1963, that a group of Jews from Riga organized themselves to clean up and consecrate the ground where a massacre of tens of thousands had taken place during World War II. This act--of coming together as a community to remember--signaled the start of the Soviet Jewry movement. Underneath a canopy of tall birch trees, the place was solemn and felt sacred. It was not hard to imagine how those Jews could have been moved to action by the knowledge of all those buried beneath them. You couldn't help but be affected by it. This was the kind of emotional motivation that was simply impossible to understand from a distance. I needed to stand on that earth, too.</p> <i>-Gal Beckerman</i> <p>(Photo � Nina Subin)</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Photographs from <i>When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone</i></b><br> <b>(Click on images to enlarge)</b> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>June 1964, a week-long interfaith fast takes place in front of the Soviet mission in Manhattan.</td> <td>The movement inspired some striking poster art, including this 1969 design by Israeli artist Dan Reisinger.</td> <td>An iconic photo of the most famous refusenik activists, taken in 1976.</td> <td>1978 gathering--Leonid Volvovsky, who was later imprisoned for his activities, is at the microphone.</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1981--Yuli Kosharovsky with his wife and baby.

What made Soviet Jews so much worse off than other people living in the totalitarian state?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I get this question a lot and it's important to answer. First, Jews have always occupied a strange place in the Russian psyche, often perceived as parasites or fifth columnists, the constant outsiders. They were never allowed to completely assimilate and at times of upheaval became convenient scapegoats--a situation that did not change even after the Bolsheviks created a socialist "paradise." But the other, more crucial distinction is that unlike Ukrainians or Latvians or any other "national" group in the Soviet Union, Jews had no indigenous land they could go to where they could speak their language and express their identity. Israel was the only option. Once a new self-awareness among Jews started to catch on in the early 1960s, they tried at first to imagine opening up a space of cultural and religious life for themselves within the Soviet Union. When it was clear that even this threatened the authorities, they turned their sights toward emigration. Thus, a movement.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Is there any relevance today to this story? Any modern parallels?<p></p> <b>A:</b> The story is still very relevant, and not only because Russia is behaving more and more like the old Soviet state in its suppression of dissent. One of the big questions the book poses is how a country like the United States balances its national security interests with moral imperatives. Soviet Jewry very much introduced this tension into the Cold War, turning it into a conflict that was about more than just who had how many missiles. This balance still poses incredible challenges for the United States. Take the case of China. On the one hand, the expansion of relations since the 1970s has had great economic benefits, but it has been accompanied by a deep undercurrent of discomfort about the censorship and repression that allows China&#x2019;s nominally Communist authorities to stay in power. Iran is an even more dramatic example. The issue of how much and how publicly to support the growing democracy movement while also trying to stop their nuclear program strongly echoes debates from the 1970s surrounding Soviet Jews. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> What kind of research did you have to do?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Since there really wasn't much primary material on the Soviet side of the story, I had to conduct many interviews. I spoke to over two hundred people for the book, mostly in Israel, the United States, and Russia, sometimes for hours, sitting in their living rooms over cups of tea or--often--glasses of vodka and plates of pickled mushrooms. Many of these people felt like they had been forgotten. When I arrived in their homes with my tape recorder, they were only too happy to share the part they felt they had played in history. Also crucial for telling the Soviet side were documents uncovered by an Israeli researcher that gave a view into how the Kremlin saw their "Jewish problem." It was quite an experience to read the transcript of a politburo meeting in which Leonid Brezhnev suddenly says, "Zionism is making us stupid..." For the American side, it was much more straightforward: huge and largely untouched archives exist for the two largest organizations dealing with Soviet Jewry.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What was the most dramatic part of the story?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Just in terms of heart-racing plot, nothing can really beat the episode of the Leningrad hijacking. This was the story of a group of Soviet Jews who tried to hijack a plane and fly it out of the Soviet Union. At some point they were sure they would get caught but continued anyway with the hope that even if they were arrested or killed, this was the best way to reveal their cause to the rest of the world. I interviewed most of the plotters and even spent the thirty-fifth anniversary of the hijacking with them at a BBQ cookout in Israel. This allowed me to describe in great detail the tick-tock leading up to the moment, on the tarmac, when they were tackled to the ground and taken into custody. What happened afterward was pretty remarkable as well. The Soviets put on a show trial and sentenced the two leaders to death. But there was such a world outcry in response that the death sentences were commuted.<p></p> <br> <br>GAL BECKERMAN, a reporter at the<i> Forward,</i> was a longtime editor and staff writer at the <i>Columbia Journalism Review</i> and has also written for the <i>New York Times,</i> the <i>Wall Street Journal, </i>and the <i>Washington Post. <p></p></i></p><h2>I Loved You More</h2><p>Tom Spanbauer&#x2019;s first novel in seven years is a love story triangle akin to <i>The Marriage Plot</i> and <i>Freedom</i>, only with a gay main character who charms gays and straights alike. <i>I Loved You More</i> is a rich, expansive tale of love, sex, and heartbreak, covering twenty-five years in the life of a striving, emotionally wounded writer.

The scope and emotional range of this poignant story are surprisingly narrow, as though O'Nan locked himself in a narrative box, tied one hand behind his back and then dared himself to make it engaging. The fact that he pulls it off is a testament to his precision and empathy."<br> <i><b>--The Washington Post Book World</b></i><br><br> "In prose as wondrously spare as the lives of the characters, O'Nan exposes their pathos, a stripped-down fragility made all the more poignant by their fledgling efforts at resilience.

Contact Marie at marie@marieforce.com."I'll bet there was less red at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre," Lt. Sam Holland said as she stood in the doorway to the Fraternal Order of Police Hall and surveyed the scene before her.<br><br>"Wow." Senator Nick Cappuano took a long look around the big room. <em>"Wow"</em><br><br>Sam's sister Tracy joined them. "Oh. My. God. Celia and her friends went freaking <em>nuts</em> with the hearts and flowers."<br><br>Every square inch of the large room was decorated with red flowers, balloons and streamers.<br><br>"I've seen murders that were less bloody than this reception," Sam said.<br><br>"It is her first wedding," Nick reminded them. "She has the right to go all out."<br><br>Sam wondered if he'd expect his first wedding to be as elaborate. She'd been there, done that and had no desire to do it again. But for him... Well, for him she'd do just about anything. However, she was drawing the line at hearts and flowers. She had a reputation to uphold.<br><br>"Holy shit," Sam's sister Angela said when she joined them. "Check out the ice sculpture. Jesus."<br><br>"Cupid, not Jesus," Nick said, smiling at the horror on the sisters' faces. "Be nice, you guys. Celia is so excited."<br><br>"I had no idea she had this in her." Sam battled her way through the streamers and balloon ribbons to get to the bar. She needed a drink, and she needed it now.<br><br>"You'd be well advised to keep her far, <em>far</em> away from your wedding," Tracy said.<br><br>"No kidding." Sam downed a glass of pinot grigio and gestured for another. "How much of this do you suppose Dad knew about?"<br><br>"None of it," Angela said, smirking.<br><br>"He's a smart man," Nick said, "so I'm sure he told her to do whatever she wanted."<br><br>"Is that what a smart man does?" Sam asked, raising an eyebrow.<br><br>"Not <em>this</em> smart man. If I did that, we'd end up with beer and peanuts at O'Leary's."<br><br>"And that would be bad how exactly?"<br><br>Nick bent to kiss her. "We can do better."<br><br>Before Sam could tell him she didn't want to do better than O'Leary's, they were interrupted by the arrival of the bride and groom. Sam couldn't deny that her father and his new wife radiated happiness. How could Sam begrudge the woman who had married her paralyzed father the reception of her dreams? Her own wedding, Sam vowed silently, would be as low-key as she could possibly make it. In fact, eloping was starting to look <em>really</em> good to her.<br><br>Dressed in red satin bridesmaid gowns, Celia's new stepdaughters stood faithfully by her side while she cut the heart-shaped red velvet cake and fed a piece to her groom. They endured the speeches and the toasts and smiled for no fewer than a thousand photographs. The ultimate insult, however, still awaited them.<br><br>"She can't make us," Tracy said when the DJ asked the sisters, their husbands and fianc� to come to the dance floor.<br><br>"Dad can make us," Angela said. "He still has that <em>look.</em> You know the one I mean."<br><br>"I've never wanted to be called to a murder scene more than I do right now," Sam said through gritted teeth.<br><br>"Ladies," Nick said with that charming smile he'd been using all day to manage them, "it's one dance, and then you're done."<br><br>"I know I speak for my sisters when I tell you to shut up and stop defending Valentine's Day Bridezilla," Sam said.<br><br>Nick laughed at the dismay on their faces as the first notes of Bette Midler's "The Rose" filled the room.<br><br>"I'm going to puke in my shoes," Angela muttered. Three-and-a-half months pregnant with her second child, she'd been green for weeks.<br><br>"Those are <em>my</em> Jimmy Choos," Sam reminded her, "and if you puke on them, I'll kill you."<br><br>Angela scowled at her. "Would you rather I puked on those?" She nodded to the Manolos that Nick had bought Sam to wear the night they got engaged.<br><br>Sam glanced down at the precious shoes. "Don't even think about it."<br><br>"Mine are from Payless," Tracy said. "Puke away."<br><br>Nick took Sam's hand as Angela's husband Spencer and Tracy's husband Mike did the same with their reluctant wives. The guys made for a dashing trio in the tuxedos they'd worn as Skip's groomsmen.<br><br>Across the room, Sam's partner, Detective Freddie Cruz, Detective Tommy "Gonzo" Gonzales and some of her other detectives were sharing a laugh that was&#x2014;no doubt&#x2014;at her expense. She'd think of some way to punish them on their next shift. It didn't escape her notice that Freddie had brought his girlfriend Elin Svend-sen or that Gonzo was there with Nick's chief of staff Christina Billings. Sam didn't approve of either relationship, but no one had bothered to ask her opinion.<br><br>When she realized Nick wasn't going to let her escape the mandatory dance, Sam gave up the fight. Besides, being pressed against his muscular chest was one of her favorite places to be, so she may as well enjoy this obligatory moment.<br><br>At six foot four, he was one of the few people in her life who towered over her. Those broad shoulders, the chocolate brown hair that curled at the ends, amazing hazel eyes, smooth olive-toned skin... Sam had never known a sexier guy. And that mouth, <em>whoa.</em> Speaking of sexy.<br><br>"There," Nick said, apparently sensing her capitulation. "Isn't that better?"<br><br>"I'm still mad at you."<br><br>"You can punish me later." Bringing his lips in close to her ear, he added, "All night long."<br><br>Sam smiled at his softly spoken words. She didn't want to because he was making her dance to the cheesi-est, most cliched song her stepmother could've possibly chosen. But let's face it, she was slow dancing with Nick, and that definitely went a long way toward making things all better.<br><br>Nick's lovely chest ruined the moment by vibrating against her cheek.<br><br>"Ignore it," he said of the phone he'd stashed in his chest pocket. "No phones today."<br><br>"You won't hear me arguing." They still hadn't managed a full day off together in the nearly two months since they'd reconnected after U.S. Senator John O'Connor's murder just before Christmas. Six years after a memorable one-night stand, they'd picked up right where they'd left off. Nick had since been tapped to complete the last year of John's term in the Senate and was now in the midst of the campaign to win the seat on his own in November. They'd looked forward to this day off for weeks and had big plans for a romantic early Valentine's Day celebration after the wedding.<br><br>Nick's phone buzzed again. "Ignore," he said more forcefully this time.<br><br>"What if it's your dad or there's some sort of disaster in Virginia? You can't just ignore it."<br><br>"Yes, I can." With all the campaigning he'd been doing lately, she knew he needed the day off even more than she did but if there was one thing Sam couldn't stand, it was a ringing phone.<br><br><em>"Nick."</em><br><br><em>"Sam"</em><br><br>She worked her hand into his jacket to retrieve the buzzing phone. "Henry Lightfeather," she read off the screen. Even she recognized the name of the senior senator from Arizona.<br><br>"Work." Nick tightened his arms around her. "He can wait until Monday."<br><br>"He's called twice."<br><br>"He can <em>wait."</em><br><br>"There's a voice mail message. Aren't you curious?"<br><br>"Okay, it's official&#x2014;you're an even bigger workaholic than I am."<br><br>"Not possible. Hey, he sent a text&#x2014;'Call me, Nick. 911.'"<br><br>Nick stopped dancing and took the phone from her. "Now you've gone and done it," he said with a scowl.<br><br>"Done what?"<br><br>"If you had ignored it, I never would've seen that text. Now I have no choice but to call him."<br><br>She grinned at him. "At least we can escape this nightmare dance before the seed becomes a rose."<br><br>Phone pressed to his ear, Nick stalked off the dance floor. Halfway across the room, he stopped, turned and signaled to Sam.<br><br>Curious, she walked over to join him.<br><br>"He's actually looking for you, Lieutenant." Nick handed the phone to Sam and went to have a word with Skip and Celia.<br><br>"Senator," Sam said. "This is Sam Holland. What can I do for you?"<br><br>"I need you to come here," Lightfeather said. He sounded rattled and undone. "Right now. I think she might be dead. I need you. Just you. No other cops."<br><br>"Who's dead?"<br><br>"Regina." His voice broke. "Beautiful Regina."<br><br>"How can you tell she's dead?"<br><br>"There's so much blood, and she's cold."<br><br>"Where are you, Senator?"<br><br>He rattled off an address in Columbia Heights, a culturally diverse neighborhood located in the city's northwestern corner.<br><br>"I'm on my way. Don't touch her. Don't touch anything. Do you understand?"<br><br>"Yes," he said, his voice breaking. "Hurry."<br><br>After a quick trip to Nick's house so Sam could exchange the red satin bridesmaid monstrosity for jeans, Nick drove her from Capitol Hill to Columbia Heights. As he dodged the black BMW through traffic, Sam wondered when he'd started driving like a cop and how she'd failed to notice.<br><br>"What do you know about him?" she asked.<br><br>"He's a friend&#x2014;one of the first to welcome me to the Senate, the first to tell me what I really needed to know, the first to offer his help."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"And what?"<br><br>"What else do you know that you're not sure you should tell me in light of current events?"<br><br>"There are times when it's terribly annoying that you know me so well."<br><br>"Likewise. Now start talking."<br><br>He glanced over at her. "I think he might be living in his office."<br><br>"Why do you say that?"<br><br>"I've seen him there at odd hours in sweats and T-shirts. He showers in the gym, but I've never seen him work out."<br><br>"If you're there at odd hours, why can't he be?"<br><br>"It doesn't seem like he's actually working, you know? I hadn't really given it all that much thought, to be honest, until right now."<br><br>"Why would he be living in his office?"<br><br>"A lot of people in Congress struggle to support two places&#x2014;one in their home state and another here. As we both know, it's not cheap to live around here, and despite what people think, not everyone in politics is independently wealthy."<br><br>"Does he have a family?"<br><br>"A wife back in Sedona and five children, all adopted, a few of them special-needs."<br><br>"That could be why he doesn't have the money for an apartment in Washington."<br><br>"Wouldn't surprise me."<br><br>"He sounds like a nice guy."<br><br>"He is."<br><br>"So what's he doing with a dead woman in Columbia Heights?"<br><br>"I have no idea."<br><br>Covered in blood, Henry waited for them on the landing outside Regina's third-floor apartment. Sam took a quick inventory of the senator: medium build, dark complexion, jet-black hair and eyes. He was younger than he appeared on television&#x2014;late forties, early fifties at most.<br><br>"Hurry," he said when he saw them coming. "This way." Henry grabbed Sam's arm and all but dragged her into a shabby apartment. She let him lead her only because he was Nick's friend. Anyone else would have a broken hand by now. "In the bedroom."<br><br>Regina lay naked on the floor in two pools of blood, one by her head, and the other between her legs. Her throat had been slit from ear to ear. She had long dark hair, a slender build, small but firm breasts and smooth skin that was marred only by a few stretch marks on her belly, indication that she'd probably birthed at least one child or lost a tremendous amount of weight. Based on her slender body, Sam was betting on the baby. She judged the victim to be in her mid-thirties and was able to see past all the blood to determine she'd been quite beautiful.<br><br>When Nick saw the bloody scene, he gasped but at least he didn't seem faint as he had at previous crime scenes. The more time he spent with her, the more used to such things he seemed to become. Sam wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing.<br><br>Next to Sam, Henry broke down as he stared at the dead woman.<br><br>"How do you know her, Senator?" Sam asked Henry.<br><br>He was crying so hard he couldn't reply.<br><br>"She works for the company that cleans the Capitol," Nick said, his tone flat with shock. Sam had heard that tone far too often after the murders of Nick's friends John O'Connor and Julian Sinclair.<br><br>"Did you know her?" Sam asked Nick.<br><br>"I've seen her around."<br><br>She sensed there was more to it than that, but she decided to wait until they were alone to grill him further. To Henry, she said, "Senator, I need to call this in."<br><br>"I have to go," he said, panicked. "I can't be here when the police come."<br><br>"I'm afraid you'll have to stay, sir. You're a material witness at the very least." She glanced at his blood-covered dress shirt and then up at his dark eyes.<br><br>"At the very least? What does that mean?"<br><br>Well aware of the power this man yielded on Capitol Hill, Sam swallowed hard. "I have no way to know whether or not you're responsible for this without investigating further."<br><br>Outrage mixed with grief as Henry stared at her. "I called you because I thought you could help me! We have to find the person who did this to her!" He looked imploringly at Nick. "Tell her. You know me, Nick. You know I couldn't have done something like this!"<br><br>To his credit, Nick said nothing.<br><br>"I can't believe this! <em>You actually think I could've done this to her?"</em> He swiped ferociously at the tears cascading down his face.<br><br>She fixed her eyes on his bloodstained shirt. "I need to rule you out as a suspect. You can either help or hinder that process, but either way, you're not going anywhere, Senator. Do you understand?"<br><br>"Yeah," he said bitterly. "I get it."<br><br>"I'd like you both to move to the hallway." After they stepped out of the room, Sam reached for her cell phone. "This is Lieutenant Holland. I need to report a homicide in Columbia Heights."</p><h2>Film Art: An Introduction</h2><p>Known for its outstanding scholarship and comprehensive coverage, Bordwell and Thompson&#39;s Film Art provides a firm foundation for introductory film courses. It explains the techniques specific to film as a medium, discusses the principles by which entire films are constructed, and explores how these techniques and formal principles have changed over the history of moviemaking. The authors seek to fully apprise students of the rich array of choices available to filmmakers while sharpening their analytical skills as viewers.</p><p><i>Film Art</i> is often assigned to college students taking their first film class. Authors David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson do not follow the traditional method of teaching film art through a close analysis of individual films. Instead, they provide an overview of the major issues students confront when they watch movies. In clear, straightforward prose, the authors describe and dissect the complexities of filmmaking, film narrative, film form, and film technique. This book serves as a fine introduction not only to the field of film studies, but also to the theories and concerns of two of the most important scholars in that field.David Bordwell is Jacques Ledoux Professor Emeritus of Film Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Despite having a population of only seven, Snowbound has a cafe, a grocery, an airstrip and, as 31-year-old Los Angeles native Jenna Campbell soon learns, several bighearted bachelors. Having spent six years mooning after her workaholic boss, Brad Fulton, who barely knows she's alive, executive assistant Jenna is now ready to seek snowier pastures. She quits her job and heads to Beesley, Ala., to meet Dalton Gray, a poetic outdoorsman who has been corresponding with her via e-mail. But when Dalton doesn't arrive at the airport to greet her, she hires Reid Jamison, her annoying seatmate, to fly her to Beesley. Reid knows Dalton and has good reason to despise him, so he changes directions and whisks Jenna away to his home in Snowbound. Meanwhile, Brad decides he can't function without Jenna and vows to do anything (even offer marriage) to get her back, and Dalton frantically searches for her in the local bars. Add Jenna's flighty, five-times-married-and-divorced mother, Chloe, to the mix, and the madcap race is on for who will win Jenna's heart. Macomber's characters never evolve beyond their stock roles, and the romance between Reid and the exasperatingly prissy Jenna is superficial. Dialogue-heavy and virtually devoid of the kind of descriptive details that would wrap readers up in the book's snowy setting, this tall tale has all the intensity and substance of a fall flurry. Still, it's a fast, frothy fantasy for those looking to add some romance to their holidays. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Jenna is used to taking care of everyone, including her filthy-rich boss, Brad, so when she meets a man online who wants to take care of her, she abruptly quits her job and sets off for Alaska. But when she arrives, Dalton isn't anywhere to be found, so resourceful Jenna hires a pilot named Reid to fly her to him. But Reid knows that Dalton is a womanizer, so he brings Jenna to his home in Snowbound instead. Jenna is beyond angry at being kidnapped, but when a snowstorm forces her to spend days on end with Reid, she realizes that for some reason she likes his caveman ways and passive plays (he seems to be attracted to her but won't act on it). But just as the two are on the verge of expressing their feelings, Dalton and Brad arrive. This is an amusing and promising setup, but Macomber fails to make the most of it, which may not deter her many followers. <i>Megan Kalan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Not just a SOPRANOS fan book, not just your typical Italian cookbook, THE SOPRANOS FAMILY COOKBOOK makes it easy to cook ziti as good as Carmela&#39;s and satisfy your SOPRANOS cravings at the same time. THE SOPRANOS FAMILY COOKBOOK contains over one hundred recipes created with the character in mind, luscious pictures of the prepared dishes and photographs of Tony, his family, and all the wiseguys eating and cooking big, beautiful Italian meals. We&#39;ve got Uncle Junior waxing nostalgic about Newark&#39;s Little Italy, Tony&#39;s grilling tips, Janice&#39;s stroll down dysfunctional memory lane, Artie&#39;s signature specialties a la Bucco, Livia&#39;s handwritten recipe for biscotti from 1967 and Carmela&#39;s favor-inducing ricotta pie with pineapple. Salted with SOPRANOS flavour, peppered with little known background and references, get behind the scenes - and into the kitchen - with these family dishes. The way to the heart of the SOPRANOS is through the stomach, and the way to create traditional Neapolitan feasts is with THE SOPRANOS FAMILY COOKBOOK.</p><p>Allen Rucker is a writer and television journalist. He is the author of THE SOPRANOS: A FAMILY HISTORY, and has also written numerous award-winning TV specials and documentaries. Michele Scicolone is the author of six Italian cookbooks, and has been nominated for both the Julia Child and James Beard Foundation Awards.In what is quite possibly the most fun of all the Sopranos-themed titles being published in time for the show's September return, this tongue-in-cheek cookbook brings homestyle Soprano family cooking to the table. Artie Bucco, the character (played by John Ventimiglia) who is the chef at the show's Vesuvio restaurant, sets the tone of this book of insider "family" secrets by explaining his family's move from Campania, Italy, to New Jersey, then turns to various Soprano characters. (A brief chapter on Neapolitan cooking is explained by the Newark Public Library's Natalie del Greco, who offers recipes for a simple Marinara Sauce as well as a Sunday Gravy.) In a chapter entitled "The Soprano Family Tradition," Bucco listens as Corrado Soprano Jr., or Uncle Jun', reminisces about Newark's Little Italy (which at one time felt like an "Italian Disneyland") while whetting his appetite with thoughts of Pasta Fagiole and Panzerotti (Neapolitan Potato Croquettes). While the book's conceit is playfully written by Rucker (The Sopranos: A Family History) in the voice of each character, the recipes, by Scicolone (Italian Holiday Cooking), are solid and honest-to-goodness Italian-American dishes. In a conversation with Bucco, Carmela Soprano reveals her Sicilian upbringing through such recipes as `Shcarole and Garlic (sauteed escarole), while scale-tipping Bobby Bacala pontificates on the importance of sweets and offers his own way to make Cannoli. Even the godfather himself, Tony Soprano, lectures on the art of the grill (fans will remember his BBQ panic attack). In the end, readers are left with a book-filled with stills from Soprano episodes-that is alternately enticing and wonderfully tacky, just like the Soprano family members themselves.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eternity of Eagles: The Human History Of The Most Fascinating Bird In The World</h2><p><i>The Eagle&#x2019;s Shadow</i> is a profusely illustrated celebration of all things eagle, by a naturalist who has kept eagles himself and ridden with the eagle tribes of Central Asia.&#x201d;</p><p>From one of the foremost authors and naturalists in the country comes a compulsively readable natural and social history of the most fascinating bird in the world&#x2014;the eagle&#x2014;with an introduction by Annie Proulx.

Reissue.</p><p>The lights are on in Snowfield, California, a cozy ski village nestled in the Sierra Madres, but nobody seems to be home. When Dr. Jenny Paige returns to the small town, she finds tables set for dinner, meals being prepared, and music playing in living rooms, but there's no trace of the people who put the water on to boil or set an extra place for company at the dinner table. As she explores the town, Paige finds friends and neighbors felled by a mysterious force--the bodies show no visible signs of violence or disease, and no known plague kills victims before the ice in their dinner drinks has time to melt. But the deep quiet that surrounds her offers few clues about the fate of the town's inhabitants. Dean Koontz's <i>Phantoms</i> strikes fear in readers from the very beginning. The mystery deepens, paving the way for a chilling journey toward the truth. If you plan to catch the film version, starring Ben Affleck and Peter O'Toole, remember that you'll be experiencing this terrifying story in a dark theater.

As a teenager on New York's Lower East Side, Arlyne Weiss dressed provocatively, flirted brazenly, and had sex with anyone who struck her as enticingly dangerous. Although her family was Jewish and she had affairs with cronies of her father (like Nate, whom she found one night with a bullet in his head), she preferred Italians, usually small-time gangsters, who lived from one shady deal to the next. Weiss married furrier Norman Brickman and became pregnant, but they parted before the baby was born. After a stint as a call girl that led to a violent gang rape, she met and became obsessed with a minor-league hood associated with the Genovese family. Weiss got involved in his numbers operation, and when they were busted, she accepted the cops' invitation to inform. Early on, she spilled just random wise-guy gossip, but soon lots of law- enforcement agencies (the FBI, the DEA) got in on the act. Weiss began wearing a wire, going after loan sharks and drug-dealers, cleverly inducing them to implicate themselves on tape, feeling no qualms about betraying her former friends. She never was able to get anything on John Gotti, but she testified at the racketeering trial of godfather Carmine Persico, and although she was humiliated on the stand, he and his codefendants were convicted. There's a voyeuristic charge to peering into this sordid world as Weiss careens from teenage sex sprees to haphazard crime schemes to her ultimate isolation, her only child, a heroine addict, having died of AIDS. Carpenter adeptly lays out a tremendous amount of information, but in the end it's the bleakness of the picture that overwhelms: the sexism, small-mindedness, and addiction to excitement that characterize life in the mob.

Now here's the book he needs. <br> <br> While many books are offered for the CEO who aims to survive the cutthroat competition of the corporate jungle, not a single one offers to help those same CEOs when the law catches up with them. That is, until now. <br> <br> This book offers valuable advice for those executives who have cooked the books, and now find themselves paying the price. Borowitz covers all aspects of prison life, from exit strategies (prison-break tips) to ways of keeping the business acumen sharp (how to make the Warden your most valuable employee) to prison cell feng shui and even self-defense (how to use this book as a deadly weapon). Convicted corporate executives should look at this time spent in prison as an opportunity, rather than a disadvantage. New business contacts can be established, new management strategies tested-time can even be spent working on the golf game so it says sharp for ten, twenty, however many years. <br> Direct from Bernie Madoff's cellmate, <i>Who Moved My Soap? The CEO's Guide to Surviving in Prison</i> is loaded with helpful tips, including: <li>Complete Corporate-Speak/Prison Slang Glossary</li> <li>How to earn $$$ making vanity license plates</li> <li>Trophy wives, and how to avoid becoming one</li> <li>How to avoid getting back-stabbed literally</li> <br> Don't forget, <i>Who Moved My Soap?</i> will be both small enough to fit in the pocket of your prison uniform, but also thick enough to hollow out and hide cigarettes in! <br> <br> <i>Who Moved My Soap?</i> is a must read for any white collar criminal. CEOs headed to the Big House will now have something to read to help them pass the time. It's also a must read for those of us who were fleeced by them.</p><p>Andy Borowitz is a comedian and satirist whose work appears in <i>The New Yorker </i>and at his award-winning website, BorowitzReport.com. He was the first-ever winner of the National Press Club&#x2019;s award for humor.<b>Chapter One: </b><br><br><b>Put Your Hands in the Air and Step Away from the Desk</b><br><br>If you're a convicted CEO who's heading to prison for the first time, let me just say this: You should be totally stoked. A trip to the slammer could be the best career move you ever made, and after a few weeks behind bars, you'll be kicking yourself for not getting convicted sooner.<br><br>Surprised? I thought you might be. You've probably bought into the conventional wisdom that a prison sentence is some kind of "punishment," a fate to be avoided at all costs. Well, you won't see me slicing that brand of baloney. If you follow the simple advice in this book, you'll discover what successful CEO convicts everywhere already know: If time is money, then hard time is hard cash.<br><br>Are you drinking the Kool-Aid yet? If not, perhaps a few facts will change your mind:<br><br>Thanks to the rising tide of corporate scandals, former CEOs are pouring into America's penitentiaries in record numbers, the biggest migration of white-collar criminals into the penal system since the fall of the Nixon administration. Within the next five years, one out of four CEOs in the United States will be convicted and sent to jail, while another one out of four will flee the country in a single-engine plane with gold coins and priceless diamonds sewn into his underpants. Still another one out of four will plea-bargain his way into performing community service, such as teaching inner city youths and the elderly how to destroy incriminating documents and create fictitious off-the-books partnerships.<br><br>But that still leaves a whole lot of CEOs heading up the river -- good news for you, because you'll be far from alone. Once you're in prison, if you look to your right, and then to your left, your chances of recognizing someone from your business school class will be better than 50 percent, and even better than that if you went to Harvard. According to a recent study, prison construction <br>in the United States is lagging well behind the pace of CEO convictions, and by the end of the decade there will be as many as one <i>hundred thousand</i> CEOs behind bars -- roughly ten thousand times the number of people who are looking forward to the next Meg Ryan film.<br><br>Will prison change these chief executive offenders? Based on anecdotal evidence, just the opposite is occurring. With each passing day, these "barbarians at the prison gate" are reinventing prison as we know it, turning up their noses at such outmoded goals of incarceration as "rehabilitation" and "paying one's debt to society." Being thrown in a cell hasn't kept them from thinking outside the box -- far from it. When an incarcerated CEO wakes up in the morning, he doesn't see the concrete walls, the barbed wire, or the ferocious guard dogs -- he sees an ideal place to grow a new business, far from the prying eyes of the SEC and the Department of Justice. The inmate of yesteryear was always looking for a fight; today's convicted CEO is in search of excellence.<br><br>So before you head off to the pokey, get over that shopworn myth about prison being a bad thing. If you're smart enough and savvy enough -- and the fact that you've bought this book is a pretty good sign that you are both -- you'll emerge from your time in the joint more productive, more innovative, and millions of dollars wealthier than you were on the day that the prison guard first checked you for lice.<br><br>Not buying this? I know what you're thinking: I'm just another slick con man, primed to sell you a bill of goods and make out like a bandit.<br><br>Well, guess again: I'm a convicted CEO myself.<br><br>That's right. And I'm not just some run-of-the-mill, caught-with-his-hands-in-the-cookie-jar CEO, either: Just last year, Forbes named me one of "America's Top 100 Convicted CEOs," putting my police mug shot on the cover of that esteemed publication. Yes, Forbes gave me my "props," and in the select fraternity of imprisoned chief executives, it doesn't get any better than that.<br><br>I can tell you still have your doubts. "If he's so important," you say, your words slurred by the cocktail of antidepressants and tranquilizers you've been on ever since your verdict was announced, "why did he even bother to write this book?" A good question that deserves a good answer -- and this time, for a change, I won't take the Fifth.<br><br>Before I took my first fateful ride on the so-called "dog bus" to prison, shackled to a fellow convict who had a picture of the cast of "The Facts of Life" tattooed on his back, I paid a visit to my local bookstore, hoping to find some reference work that might help ease my transition from CEO to CBO (Cell Block Occupant). What did I find there? Cookbooks. Cat books. Book after book of poetry by the pop singer Jewel, all drastically reduced. But nowhere did I find a book preparing the former CEO for his stay in prison, even though convicted CEOs represent the fastest-growing segment of the reading public today. I vowed with all my heart to correct this sad state of affairs, and once I received assurances from my attorney that the thousands of shareholders currently engaged in class-action lawsuits against me could claim no share of my publishing royalties, I buckled down and began to write.<br><br>Writing a book while in prison is not an easy task. When an inmate in the cell next to mine started screaming, "Press the bunk, punk!!!" at the top of his lungs, I could not ask him to keep it down; when I dropped my pen on the floor, I was afraid to pick it up. Yet, somehow, I prevailed, and you are now holding the fruits of my efforts in your sweaty, trembling hands.<br><br>If you're a CEO who's been caught, this is the one book you won't want to be caught without. I hope this book is helpful as you trade your pinstripes for horizontal ones. I hope this book is long enough to answer your most pressing questions, short enough to hold your attention, yet thick enough to hollow out and hide a small weapon in. Read it, study it, learn from it -- and for heaven's sake, don't skim it. After all, you're not going anywhere.<br><br>U.S. Penitentiary Lomax, Cell Block Six<br><br>Lomax, Alabama<br><br>January 2003<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Andy Borowitz</p><h2>Many Mansions: The Edgar Cayce Story of Reincarnation</h2><p>...is recorded fact.

We know the tales of Columbus and Captain Cook, yet much earlier mariners made equally bold and world-changing voyages. From the moment when ancient Polynesians first dared to sail beyond the horizon, Fagan vividly explains how our mastery of the oceans changed the course of human history. </p><p>What drove humans to risk their lives on open water? How did early sailors unlock the secrets of winds, tides, and the stars they steered by? What were the earliest ocean crossings like? With compelling detail, Fagan reveals how seafaring evolved so that the forbidding realms of the sea gods were transformed from barriers into a nexus of commerce and cultural exchange. From bamboo rafts in the Java Sea to triremes in the Aegean, from Norse longboats to sealskin kayaks in Alaska, Fagan crafts a captivating narrative of humanity's urge to challenge the unknown and seek out distant shores. <i>Beyond the Blue Horizon </i>will enthrall readers who enjoyed Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i>, Simon Winchester's <i>Atlantic</i>, and Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel.</i></p></p><p>Brian Fagan is emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

A much-honored teacher and the recipient of a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship, he is in regular demand as a speaker on various topics in American history, politics, and culture.Indiana University historian McGerr (The Decline of Popular Politics: The American North, 1865-1928) examines the social, cultural and political currents of a movement that, through its early successes and ultimate failure, has defined today's "disappointing" political climate. From the late 19th century until the Great Depression, American progressives undertook a vast array of reforms that shook the nation to its core, from class and labor issues to vice, immigration, women's rights and the thorny issues of race. In three parts, McGerr illuminates the origins of Progressive thought, the movement's meteoric ascent in American life and its descent into "the Red scare, race riots, strikes and inflation," positing that the Progressive vision of remaking America in its own middle-class image eventually sparked a backlash that persists to this day. McGerr hits all the usual notes associated with the Progressive era: the political ascensions of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and Progressivism's revered heroes (Jane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois) are well represented. It is McGerr's vivid portrait of turn-of-the-century America, however, that separates this book from the pack. Expertly weaving an array of vignettes and themes throughout his narrative, McGerr pulls into focus a period in American history too often blurred by the rapid pace of social, political and cultural change. He contrasts the values and lives of some of the "upper ten"-America's wealthy, high society families, the Rockefellers and Morgans-with unknown immigrant laborers and farmers the Golubs and Garlands. He discusses the dawn of the automobile as a hallmark in the struggle for women's rights. The plight of African-American boxer Jack Johnson resonates against the backdrop of segregation. And the life and work of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the dawn of flight, and communication breakthroughs are also explored. Simply put, this is history at its best. McGerr's wide-ranging narrative opens our eyes not just to the broad strokes of a widely varying movement but to the true dimensions of an explosive era when the society we know today was forged amid rapid industrialization, cultural assimilation and a volatile international scene. Perhaps most compelling, and the mark of any great work of history, is McGerr's success in connecting the Progressive era to the world of today. The social and economic chaos of the 1960s and '70s and the rebirth of conservatism reinforce "the basic lesson of the Progressive era," McGerr concludes: "reformers should not try too much." In today's trying times, McGerr doubts that today's leaders will undertake "anything as ambitious as the Progressives' Great Reconstruction." That prospect, McGerr concludes, "is at once a disappointment and a relief." This is a truly remarkable effort from one of our nation's finest historians.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Deepest Waters</h2><p>What began as a fairytale honeymoon in 1857 for John and Laura Foster aboard the steamship S.S.

But Kirby is destined to inherit the magical power to freeze time in its tracks. Power like that promises unlimited wealth, wealth that can&#39;t buy love, but does make a down payment on a lot of deadly trouble. In a universe without time, can Kirby stay one step ahead?</p><p><b>John D. MacDonald </b>was an American novelist and short-story writer. His works include the Travis McGee series and the novel <i>The Executioners,</i> which was adapted into the film <i>Cape Fear</i>. In 1962 MacDonald was named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America; in 1980, he won a National Book Award. In print he delighted in smashing the bad guys, deflating the pompous, and exposing the venal. In life, he was a truly empathetic man; his friends, family, and colleagues found him to be loyal, generous, and practical. In business, he was fastidiously ethical. About being a writer, he once expressed with gleeful astonishment, &#x201c;They pay me to do this! They don&#x2019;t realize, I would pay them.&#x201d; He spent the later part of his life in Florida with his wife and son. He died in 1986.One<br><br>Slowly, with a dedicated effort, Kirby tipped the universe back into focus. He heard the after-image of his voice going on and on, a tiresome encyclical of complaint, a pean to the scuffed spirit. The woman across the table from him was in silhouette against the window--a window big as a tennis court on edge--and through the window was an ocean, rosy with dusk or dawn. It made a peach gleam on her bare tanned shoulders and backlighted a creamy weight of blondness.<br><br>Atlantic, he thought. Once he had established the ocean, he found the time relationship simplified. Looking from Florida, it had to be dawn.<br><br>"You are Charla," he said carefully.<br><br>"Of course, dear Kirby," she said, amused, slightly guttural, almost laughing. "Your good new friend, Charla."<br><br>The man sat at Kirby's left, a solid, polished man, tailored, clipped, manicured. He made a soft sound of amusement. "A Spanish verb," he said. "Charlar. To chat. To make meaningless talk. An irony because her great talent is not in talking, but in listening."<br><br>"My great talent, Joseph?" she said with mock astonishment.<br><br>"Your most unusual one, my dear. But we have both enjoyed listening to Kirby."<br><br>Kirby nailed it all to a wall inside his head, like small signs. Charla, Joseph, Atlantic, dawn. He sought other clues. It could be Saturday morning. The burial service had been on Friday at eleven. The conference with the lawyers had been at two in the afternoon. And he had begun drinking at three.<br><br>He turned his head with care and looked at the empty lounge. A barman in white jacket stood under prism lights paled by the dawn, arms folded, chin on his chest.<br><br>"Do they keep these places open all night?" Kirby asked.<br><br>"Hardly ever," Joseph said. "But they respond nicely to any small gift of money. A gesture of friendship. At the official closing time, Kirby, you still had much to say."<br><br>It was brighter in the lounge. They looked at him fondly. They were mature, handsome people. They were the finest two people he had ever met. They had slight accents, an international flavor, and they looked at him with warmth and with love.<br><br>Suddenly he had a horrid suspicion. "Are you--are you some kind of journalists--or anything like that?"<br><br>They both laughed aloud. "Oh no, my sweet," Charla said.<br><br>He felt ashamed of himself. "Uncle Omar is--was--death on any kind of publicity. We always had to be so careful. He paid a firm in New York thirty thousand dollars a year to keep him out of the papers. But people were always prying. They'd get some tiny little rumor about Omar Krepps and make a great big story out of it, and Uncle Omar would be absolutely furious."<br><br>Charla put her hand over his, a warm pressure. "But dear Kirby, it does not matter now, does it?"<br><br>"I guess not."<br><br>"My brother and I are not journalists, of course, but you could speak to journalists, you know. You could let the world know what a vile thing he did to you, what a horrid way he repaid your years of selfless devotion."<br><br>She was so understanding, Kirby wanted to weep. But he felt an uncomfortable twinge of honesty. "Not so selfless. I mean, you have an uncle worth fifty-million dollars, there's an ulterior motive."<br><br>"But you told us how you had quit many times," Joseph said. The warmth of Charla's hand was removed. Kirby missed it.<br><br>"But I always went back," Kirby admitted. "He'd tell me I was his favorite nephew. He'd tell me he needed me. For what? All he ever did was keep me on the run. No chance to have a life of my own. Crazy errands all over the world. Eleven years of it, ever since I got out of college. Even there, he told me the courses to take. That old man ran my whole life."<br><br>"You told us, my dear," Charla said, her voice breaking. "All those years of devotion."<br><br>"And then," Joseph said sternly, "not a penny."<br><br>The brightness of the dawn was beginning to hurt Kirby's eyes. He yawned. When he opened his eyes, Joseph and Charla were standing. Joseph went over to the barman. Charla touched his shoulder. "Come, dear. You're exhausted."<br><br>He went with her without question, out through glass doors, across a vast and unfamiliar lobby. When they were a dozen feet from the elevators he stopped. She looked up at him in question. Her face was so flawless, the eyes huge, gray-green, the parted lips moist, the honeyed skin darker than her hair, that for the moment he forgot what he was going to say.<br><br>"Darling?" she said.<br><br>"I'm not staying here, am I?"<br><br>"Joseph thought it would be better."<br><br>"Where is he?"<br><br>"We said good night to him, Kirby dear."<br><br>"Did we?"<br><br>"Come, dear."<br><br>The elevator climbed through a fragrant silken silence. He drifted down a long corridor. She took a key from a jeweled purse and let them into the suite. She closed the blinds against the dawn sunlight and took him to a bedroom. The bed was turned down. New pyjamas and an assortment of new toilet articles were laid out for him.<br><br>"Joseph thinks of everything," she said. "Once he owned some hotels, but when they began to bore him, he sold them. Kirby, dear, you must have a hot shower. Then you will sleep."<br><br>When he came back to the bedroom in the new pyjamas, she was waiting for him. She had changed to a robe of some soft fabric in a shade of gold. She had brushed her hair. She stood up and seemed very small to him without her high heels. The fitted robe sheathed and revealed a figure to fog the lenses of the little men who take pictures for the centerfolds of the more forthright magazines. It curved and cushioned into all the right dimensions and then, implausibly, curved just a little bit more. Though he felt, with thunderous pulse, as though someone were thumping him lightly on the top of the head with a padded stick, and though he felt appallingly winsome, like a boy groom, he also felt a solemn sense of responsibility. Here was a totally first-class woman, mature, fragrant, expensive, sophisticated, silken and immaculate. And one could not sidle up to her, dragging one foot and saying shucks. Heartening himself with a thousand memories of Cary Grant, he tried to saunter up to the woman, wearing a smile that was tender, knowing and suitably ravenous.<br><br>But he sauntered his bare toes into the cruel narrow leg of a small table. With a whine of anguish he lunged, off balance, at the woman--clutching at her with more the idea of breaking his fall than with any sense of improper purpose. The flailing leap alarmed her and she darted to one side emitting a small hiss of dismay. One frantic hand caught the strong golden fabric at the throat of her fitted robe. For one full half-turn, the durable fabric sustained them in the beginning of a skater's whirl, but then there was a ripping sound, and as he tumbled into a far corner he caught a glimpse of her as she plummeted out of the robe, spinning, struck the edge of the bed, bounced once and disappeared over the far edge with a soft padded thud.<br><br>He sat up, pushed the ruined robe aside, clasped his toes in both hands and made small comforting sounds.<br><br>Her tousled head appeared slowly, warily, looking at him from beyond the bed, her eyes wide. "Darling!" she said. "You are so impulsive!"<br><br>He stared at her with his face of pain. "Kindly shut up. This has been happening ever since I can remember, and I can do without the funny jokes."<br><br>"You always do this!"<br><br>"I always do something. Usually I merely run away. In the summer of 1958 I went with a beautiful woman to her suite on the seventh floor of the Continental Hilton in Mexico City. Three minutes after I closed the door, an earthquake began. Plaster fell. The hotel cracked open. We had to feel our way down the stairs in the dark. The lobby was full of broken glass. So please shut up, Charla."<br><br>"Throw me my robe, dear."<br><br>He balled it up and threw it to her. He got up and hobbled to the bed and sat down. She came around the foot of the bed and sat beside him. The robe, belted in a new way, covered her.<br><br>"Poor Kirby," she said.<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>She patted his arm. She chuckled. "I've never been undressed quite that fast before."<br><br>"Very hilarious," he said.<br><br>She touched his chin, turned his head so that he looked down into her eyes. For the moment she looked very sad. "You do tempt me, dear. Because you are so very sweet and nice. Too many charades these days. And too many men who are not like you in any respect."<br><br>"If they were all like me, the survival of the race would be in doubt."<br><br>She pulled him closer. He kissed her, abashedly at first and then with mounting enthusiasm. When he toppled her back, she wiggled free and shook her head and made a face at him. "No, dear. Joseph and I are very fond of you. And you have had a ghastly time. And Joseph told me to care for you. Now hop into bed like a sweet lamb, and take off the top of the pretty pyjamas and lay face down and I shall make you feel very, very good."<br><br>"But--"<br><br>"Darling, don't be a bore, please. I don't want to change our friendship so soon, do you?"<br><br>"If you're asking me--"<br><br>"Hush. Some day, soon maybe, you will become my lover. Who can tell? Is it not more fun to guess? Be a good boy."<br><br>He stretched out as instructed. She came back after turning out all the lights but one. She poured something cool and aromatic onto his back and began to knead the muscles of his back and shoulders and the nape of his neck with clever fingers.<br><br>"My word, you have lovely muscles, dear," she said.<br><br>"Dynamic tension."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Exercises anyone can do."<br><br>"Oh. Now just let everything fall away. Slide down into the darkness, sweet Kirby. Abandon yourself to pure sensation."<br><br>"Um."<br><br>"Rest, my dear. Rest."<br><br>Her soothing hands stroked the tension out of him. He was so completely exhausted he could have fallen into sleep like falling ten thousand feet into a midnight swamp. But her touch, her gentle teasing voice, the awareness of her fragrant and erotic presence kept him suspended, floating on the surface of sleep. She hummed and the tune seemed familiar, as though he had heard it in a foreign movie.<br><br>He reached back through time to the previous Wednesday, at midnight. Fifty-seven hours ago? That was when the word had reached him at his hotel in Montevideo. The old man was dead. Omar Krepps. Uncle Omar. It was shocking to think that even death itself had the power to reach out and take that strange, invulnerable little man.<br><br>As he thought of the return trip he sank deeper in the pool of sleep and his images became confused, changed by Charla. The breast-nosed jet took off down a pale silken runway of tenderest flesh while the nude and shadowy hostesses gathered close around him, humming to him. In the midst of this half-sleep he was vaguely aware of Charla turning him, helping him into the pyjama top. Her mouth came down upon his, sweet, deft and heavy, and as he tried to lift leaden arms to hold her close, she was gone. He thought he heard her say, "I'm so sorry, dear." He wondered what she felt sorry about. The other light went off. The latch clicked. He fell off the edge of the world.<br>Two<br><br>Kirby was hauled up out of sleep by a rangy young girl he had never seen before. She shook him awake. All the lights in the room were on. He braced himself up on his elbows. She was pacing around the bed so rapidly it was difficult to keep her in focus. She was yelling at him, and the words made no sense. She had a wildly cropped mop of palomino hair, fierce green eyes bulging with fury, a lean face dark with rage. She wore a coral shirt, striped stretch pants, and waved a straw purse the size of a snare drum.<br><br>It took him long dull seconds to realize she was yelling in a language he did not understand.<br><br>When she paused for breath, he said faintly, "No comprendo, Se�orita."<br><br>She switched immediately into a torrent of fluent Spanish. He spoke it reasonably well, but not that well. He caught just enough to realize it was idiomatic, graphic and probably would have sent a Mexico City cab driver running for shelter, his hands clapped over his ears.<br><br>"Mas despacio, por favor," he pleaded when she paused for the next breath.<br><br>She looked at him narrowly. "Will English do?"<br><br>"Do what?"<br><br>"Where is my goddam aunt, and what the hell right does she think she has pulling one of her cute tricks and getting me thrown the hell off the first decent television script I've seen in a year? She can't call me down here like I'm some kind of a slave. Where's that spooky Joseph, buddy? Don't you dare try to cover for either one of them, buster. I've handled her sniveling little secretarial types before. I want the facts, and I want them right now!"<br><br>She put a small nose with abruptly flared nostrils five inches from his and glared directly into his eyes. "Well?" she said.<br><br>"Facts?"<br><br>"Facts, fellow."<br><br>She had an almost imperceptible accent, but there was an illusive familiarity about it.<br><br>"I think you're in the wrong room."<br><br>"I know I'm in the wrong room. The other rooms in the suite are empty. That's why I'm in this room. Don't stall."<br><br>"The suite?"<br><br>She stamped her foot. "The suite! Yes, the suite! My God, start tracking, fellow. Hook up with reality. This big lush suite in the Hotel Elise, eighth floor, Miami Beach, ten o'clock on this gaudy Saturday night in April, in this suite registered in the name of Charla Maria Markopoulo O'Rourke, buster, my unsainted aunt, this suite it cost me a twenty-buck bribe to get into after steaming all the way from the Coast on a jet."<br><br>"Charla!" he said. And knew where he was, and why the girl's accent, though less than Charla's, had seemed familiar. Up until that moment he had thought himself in Montevideo. "Uncle Omar is dead," he said.<br><br>"Don't waste those sick codes on me, buster. I unjoined Charla's wolf pack ages ago. Little Filiatra changed her name and her outlook and her habits because she got sick up to here of all the cute, dirty, sick little tricks.

Though a little longer in the tooth, Colonel Flashman, V.C., has lost none of his dash, cunning, amorous propensity or cowardice. His adventures begin when he accompanies a consignment of "opium" (actually guns) to Canton on behalf of a British missionary. Thereafter, as Ambassador Elgin's chief intelligence officer, he gets into a succession of dire scrapes which include being attacked by pirates and falling into the hands first of the ferocious but disciplined Taipings, then of the equally ferocious but decadent Manchu imperialists. At one point he comes within a hair's breadth of having his poltroonery exposed; at other points he finds himself the sexual partner of a Chinese Amazon and, more plaything than partner, of the formidable Imperial Concubine Yi, later empress, to whose treacherous court intrigues he becomes privy. He winds up witnessing Elgin's destruction of Peking's Summer Palace, an act of vengeance described with horrifying vividness. There's a deal of shrewd observation in Flashman, and a deal of solid history in his flamboyant memoirs, factors that add weight to their dazzle. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bluebeard Room (Nancy Drew #77)</h2><p>The young sleuth travels to Cornwall, England to uncover a mysterious coven of witches plaguing an old friend.</p><p></p><h2>Out Of The Comfort Zone</h2><p>At times, this fast-moving and true-life drama will make your hair stand on end as you enter the dark side of the supernatural.

A former international trade consultant and CBC writer/broadcaster, Shaben was 22, living and working as a journalist in the Middle East, when the crash occurred. She learned of the event, and her father's survival, reading a local newspaper.<br><b><br><br></b></p>In October 1984, a commuter plane crashed in northern Alberta. Of the 10 people aboard, there were 4 survivors: the pilot, an RCMP constable, the prisoner he was �transporting, and the author&#x2019;s father, the late Larry Shaben, Alberta&#x2019;s housing minister. Journalist Shaben relies heavily on the memories of the survivors, who formed an improbable bond as they waited, desperately, to be rescued from almost certain death from their injuries and from the freezing temperature. The rescue comes about halfway through the book. The rest of it explores the crash&#x2019;s aftermath and the lives of the survivors. Paul Archambault&#x2019;s story is the most interesting. A prisoner with a long rap sheet (car theft, breaking and entering), he became a hero after the crash, saving the RCMP constable&#x2019;s life and helping to keep his fellow survivors warm and safe until the rescuers came. For him, the crash was a life-changing event, but ultimately his life ended tragically. Although author Shaben&#x2019;s father was one of the survivors, she divides the limelight among all four of them. --David Pitt</p><h2>100 Great Breads: The Original Bestseller</h2><p>Paul Hollywood presents all the know-how you need to bake delicious and unusual breads.

One surf music superstar unwittingly subsidized the kidnapping of Frank Sinatra Jr. The transplanted Texas singer Bobby Fuller might have been murdered by the Mob in what is still an unsolved case.

Albert's poetry ultimately meets with modest acclaim but only after decades of striving. Romance and friendship are likewise elusive, despite an impulsive marriage to a stranger. His outsider status&#x2014;black, gay, and a poet&#x2014;compounds his struggles to create art, to find a readership, and to lead a meaningful existence.<br>Beautifully written in reverse chronological order, the story opens with Albert's lonely old age and ventures back in time to his arrival in New York City of the 1950s.

Suspicious of the current idea that all creative work is &#x201c;intellectual property,&#x201d; Lewis Hyde turns to America&#x2019;s founding fathers&#x2014;men like John Adams, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson&#x2014;in search of other ways to value the fruits of human wit and imagination. What he discovers is a rich tradition in which knowledge was assumed to be a commonwealth, not a private preserve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the founding fathers, democratic self-governance itself demanded open and easy access to ideas. So did the growth of creative communities, such as that of eighteenth-century science. And so did the flourishing of public persons, the very actors whose &#x201c;civic virtue&#x201d; brought the nation into being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this lively, carefully argued, and well-documented book, Hyde brings the past to bear on present matters, shedding fresh light on everything from the Human Genome Project to Bob Dylan&#x2019;s musical roots. <i>Common as Air </i>allows us to stand on the shoulders of America&#x2019;s revolutionary giants and to see beyond today&#x2019;s narrow debates over cultural ownership. What it reveals is nothing less than an inspiring vision of how to reclaim the commonwealth of art and ideas that we were meant to inherit.</p></p><p><p>Lewis Hyde is the author of <i>The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property</i>, <i>This Error Is the Sign of Love</i>, and <i>Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art </i>(FSG, 1998).

In response, the pharmaceutical industry called the move illegal and ill conceived, claiming it undermined the incentive to conduct the very research that produces AIDS drugs in the first place.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Fox News insisted that you tube remove from its site a John McCain commercial that used unauthorized video from a Fox-moderated debate. When the McCain campaign complained about suppression of political speech, you tube replied that copyright law gave them no choice, though they &#x201c;look[ed] forward to working with Senator (or President) McCain&#x201d; to improve the law.In 2000, a British scholar published a 1, 300-page anthology of modern Irish writing, twenty-four pages of which were devoted to James Joyce. Asked for permission, the Joyce estate insisted on a fee of �7,000. When the editor wrote saying he couldn&#x2019;t afford such a steep fee, the estate raised the price to �7,500, then changed its mind and refused permission outright. Ten years later, this anthology still lists Joyce&#x2019;s work in the table of contents, but pages 323 through 346 are cut from the volume.Each of these stories revolves around what we now call &#x201c;intellectual property,&#x201d; and as modern as these cases are, the question behind them is very old: in what sense can someone own, and therefore control other people&#x2019;s access to, a work of fiction or a public speech or the ideas behind a drug? The literary part of this puzzle has, by itself, a long history. Three hundred years ago in England, writers and publishers engaged in a spirited, fifty-year debate over whether or not there could even exist such a thing as &#x201c;literary property.&#x201d;Publishers in Scotland, for example, thought it made no sense for their competitors in London to claim exclusive ownership of, say, a book on oratory by Cicero or a popular poem like James Thomson&#x2019;s The Seasons. As one aggrieved Scot tried to explain, if a writer were to &#x201c;keep his Lucubrations to himself,&#x201d; then perhaps &#x201c;he may be said to have a Property in his Noddle.&#x201d; But once &#x201c;he prints . . . these Lucubrations,&#x201d; and once someone else pays for the book and reads it, &#x201c;the Person who buys has just the same Property that the Author had.&#x201d;&#x201c;To lucubrate&#x201d;: surely this is a key forgotten verb of the European Enlightenment, the root (&#x201c;lux&#x201d;) being light itself and the action indicated being the labor of studying long into the night by the flame of a lamp. Lucubrations are the mental harvest of midnight oil, and the only way to make them &#x201c;property&#x201d; in the usual sense (&#x201c;this is mine; you keep out&#x201d;) would be to keep them locked inside the skull, or so this Scottish publisher believed against the protestations of his London rivals.Centuries have passed since arguments of this sort first appeared, but the years have neither laid them to rest nor brought much clarity to the terms of engagement. &#x201c;Intellectual property&#x201d; is the phrase now used to denote ownership of art and ideas, but what exactly does it mean? Does it make sense, to begin with, to say that &#x201c;intellect&#x201d; is the source of the &#x201c;properties&#x201d; in question? A novel like Ulysses, the know-how for making antiviral drugs, Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x2019;s &#x201c;Dream&#x201d; speech, the poems of Rimbaud, Andy Warhol screen prints, Mississippi Delta blues, the source code for electronic voting machines: who could name the range of human powers and historical conditions that attends such creations? All that we make and do is shaped by the communities and traditions that contain us, not to mention by money, power, politics, and luck. And even should the artist or scientist think she has extracted herself from the world to stand alone in the studio, a tremendous array of faculties and mind-states may well attend her creativity.There is intellect, of course, but also imagination, intuition, sagacity, persistence, prudence, fantasy, lust, humor, sympathy, serendipity, will, prayer, grief, courage, visual acuity, ambition, guesswork, mother wit, memory, delight, vitality, venality, kindness, generosity, fortitude, fear, awe, compassion, surrender, sincerity, humility, and the ability to integrate diametrically opposed states of mind into harmonious wholes . . . We would need quite a few new categories to fully map this territory&#x2014;&#x201c;dream property,&#x201d; &#x201c;courage property,&#x201d; &#x201c;grief property&#x201d;&#x2014;and even if we had that list, only half the problem would have been addressed.For what exactly is &#x201c;property&#x201d;? The oil in a lamp, the light it sheds, the midnight scholar&#x2019;s flash of insight: can each of these be &#x201c;property&#x201d; and, if so, by what ample definition of the term?I will have more to say about these questions in the chapter that follows; here I&#x2019;ll simply acknowledge that my own position is not as extreme as that of the Scottish publisher. I believe there can be property in all sorts of lucubrations and, in a rightly limited form, usefully so. The very first copyright law (Britain&#x2019;s 1710 Statute of Anne) gave &#x201c;the Authors and Proprietors&#x201d; of books exclusive rights to their works for as long as twenty-eight years, provided that they paid a sixpenny fee and listed their works &#x201c;in the Register-Book of the Company of Stationers.&#x201d; For most of the twentieth century, the law in the United States was much the same: rights lasted twenty-eight years (and could be renewed once, if the owner cared) provided that works were duly registered with the copyright office. Both of these seem to me to offer sensible ways to manage the &#x201c;intellectual property&#x201d; found in books.That said, part of the task of this book is to show the degree to which a phrase like &#x201c;intellectual property&#x201d; serves simply to obscure a long history of philosophical, legal, and ethical argument about what sort of property lies under that heading and, once that&#x2019;s decided, what &#x201c;rightly limited&#x201d; should mean and why a limit to ownership might arise in the first place. Knowing the history of that debate not just well enough to follow the argument but well enough to engage with it, to take an informed position in the debate, is to my mind one of the prerequisites of cultural citizenship in the twenty-first century.But here we come to another topic that informs this book, for cultural citizenship is itself now highly contested, sufficiently so that I take it to be the site of a new culture war. For a quick overview of the terms under which that war is being waged, one could do worse than begin with a look at the public relations campaigns that the U.S. entertainment industries have been funding, especially the antipiracy curricula that they have developed and distributed to public schools.One such campaign, produced by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), has now reached hundreds of thousands of children in classrooms from New York to Los Angeles. In most schools, teachers have been free to use the offered lesson plans or not, as they see fit, though not in California, where a 2006 law mandates that all public schools must develop an &#x201c;education technology&#x201d; plan in which, for example, &#x201c;the implications of illegal peer-to-peer network file sharing&#x201d; must be taught. (The law never mentions teaching the more interesting and revolutionary implications of legal file sharing.) The year 2006 was also when the industry persuaded the Boy Scouts in Los Angeles to offer a &#x201c;Respect Copyright&#x201d; merit badge; the MPAA wrote the curriculum for that, too.Many of the assignments in these programs depend on role-playing exercises. The merit badge curriculum suggests, for example, that each Boy Scout &#x201c;write and perform a skit about why copyright protection is important.&#x201d; Elementary school children get to create greeting cards and posters and hold a &#x201c;publication party,&#x201d; at the culmination of which each child writes his or her name on a sticker that says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re part of the � TEAM!&#x201d; and then affixes this notice to the back of the work. The sticker bears a stock &#x201c;All rights reserved&#x201d; copyright declaration.In an even more elaborate exercise called &#x201c;Living in a Fishbowl,&#x201d; the teacher gives the students cards assigning each of them to one of six roles, five of which pertain directly to conventional motion picture production: actor, set carpenter, singer, director, and producer. The sixth role is a &#x201c;computer user.&#x201d; The movie people all have jobs and a clear story to tell: they work hard to make movies; copyright law rewards and protects that work, piracy threatens and destroys it. Online file-swapping, a typical character says, &#x201c;is costing me big bucks . . . [It] just isn&#x2019;t fair.&#x201d; The computer user, on the other hand&#x2014;pictured with the top of his head missing and stars shooting out of it&#x2014;offers an incoherent ramble that mixes rhetorical questions (&#x201c;How could it possibly be illegal . . . ?&#x201d;) with dismissive remarks (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really no big deal!&#x201d;). He seems to have no job.The students break into groups to talk about how to present each of these characters to the class; then one by one each student must sit in a circle of chairs&#x2014;the &#x8;...</p><h2>The Other Side of Deception: A Rogue Agent Exposes the Mossad&#39;s Secret Agenda</h2><p>Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky reveals such alarming cover-up stories as the near-assassination of George Bush and the truth behind Robert Maxwell&#39;s death.

He lives with his family in San Diego, California where he practices homeopathy.<i>Homeopathy: Beyond Flat Earth Medicine</i> by Timothy R. Dooley, is a gem of a book. Dooley's writing style is informal, conversational, and easy to read. Amazingly, it is mostly jargon-free with the history and philosophy woven throughout in colorful threads rather than delivered in dry, dusty chunks. The explanations are succinct and beautifully digestible. Dooley answers every question I have ever been asked about homeopathy--and many more--while describing virtually every aspect of homeopathic treatment. The chapters are sprinkled with memorable stories, anecdotes, and case histories that are invariably vivid, interesting, humourous, or entertaining--sometimes all at once.

It is for those moments when you are thrust into the spotlight as the token Catholic whether the spotlight is simply at the office water cooler or whether it is front and center at the in-laws Thanksgiving celebration. How to Defend the Faith without Raising Your Voice gives Catholics a fresh way of explaining the Church's teaching on contentious issues humanly, compellingly, and succinctly.<br><br>But this book does not pretend to suggest it is as simple as memorizing a speech.

But the phone&#x2019;d rung twenty-five<br>times. Normal people give up after ten or eleven, unless it&#x2019;s a matter of<br>life or death. Don&#x2019;t they? Dad&#x2019;s got an answering machine like James Garner&#x2019;s<br>in <i>The Rockford Files </i>with big reels of tape. But he&#x2019;s stopped leaving it<br>switched on recently. Thirty rings, the phone got to. Julia couldn&#x2019;t hear it up<br>in her converted attic &#x2019;cause &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t You Want Me?&#x201d; by Human League was<br>thumping out dead loud. <i>Forty </i>rings. Mum couldn&#x2019;t hear &#x2019;cause the washing<br>machine was on berserk cycle <i>and </i>she was hoovering the living room. <i>Fifty<br></i>rings. That&#x2019;s just not normal. S&#x2019;pose Dad&#x2019;d been mangled by a juggernaut on<br>the M5 and the police only had this office number &#x2019;cause all his other I.D.&#x2019;d<br>got incinerated? We could lose our final chance to see our charred father in<br>the terminal ward.<br>So I went in, thinking of a bride going into Bluebeard&#x2019;s chamber after<br>being told not to. (Bluebeard, mind, was waiting for that to happen.) Dad&#x2019;s office<br>smells of pound notes, papery but metallic too. The blinds were down so<br>it felt like evening, not ten in the morning. There&#x2019;s a serious clock on the<br>wall, exactly the same make as the serious clocks on the walls at school.<br>There&#x2019;s a photo of Dad shaking hands with Craig Salt when Dad got made regional<br>sales director for Greenland. (Greenland the supermarket chain, not<br>Greenland the country.) Dad&#x2019;s IBM computer sits on the steel desk. <i>Thousands<br></i>of pounds, IBMs cost. The office phone&#x2019;s red like a nuclear hotline and<br>it&#x2019;s got buttons you push, not the dial you get on normal phones.<br>So anyway, I took a deep breath, picked up the receiver, and said our<br>number. I can say that without stammering, at least. Usually.<br>But the person on the other end didn&#x2019;t answer.<br>"Hello?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br>They breathed in like they&#x2019;d cut themselves on paper.<br>&#x201c;Can you hear me? I can&#x2019;t hear you.&#x201d;<br><i>Very </i>faint, I recognized the <i>Sesame Street </i>music.<br>&#x201c;If you can hear me&#x201d;&#x2014;I remembered a Children&#x2019;s Film Foundation film<br>where this happened&#x2014;&#x201c;tap the phone, once.&#x201d;<br>There was no tap, just more <i>Sesame Street.<br></i>&#x201c;You might have the wrong number,&#x201d; I said, wondering.<br>A baby began wailing and the receiver was slammed down.<br>When people listen they make a listening noise.<br>I&#x2019;d heard <i>it, </i>so they&#x2019;d heard <i>me.<br><br></i>&#x201c;May as well be hanged for a sheep as hanged for a handkerchief.&#x201d; Miss<br>Throckmorton taught us that <i>aeons </i>ago. &#x2019;Cause I&#x2019;d sort of had a reason to<br>have come into the forbidden chamber, I peered through Dad&#x2019;s razor-sharp<br>blind, over the glebe, past the cockerel tree, over more fields, up to the<br>Malvern Hills. Pale morning, icy sky, frosted crusts on the hills, but no sign of<br>sticking snow, worse luck. Dad&#x2019;s swivelly chair&#x2019;s a lot like the Millennium<br>Falcon&#x2019;s laser tower. I blasted away at the skyful of Russian MiGs streaming<br>over the Malverns. Soon tens of thousands of people between here and<br>Cardiff owed me their lives. The glebe was littered with mangled fusilages<br>and blackened wings. I&#x2019;d shoot the Soviet airmen with tranquilizer darts as<br>they pressed their ejector seats. Our marines&#x2019;ll mop them up. I&#x2019;d refuse all<br>medals. &#x201c;Thanks, but no thanks,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d tell Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan<br>when Mum invited them in, &#x201c;I was just doing my job.&#x201d;<br>Dad&#x2019;s got this fab pencil sharpener clamped to his desk. It makes pencils<br>sharp enough to puncture body armor. H pencils&#x2019;re sharpest, they&#x2019;re Dad&#x2019;s<br>faves. I prefer 2Bs.<br>The doorbell went. I put the blind back to how it was, checked I&#x2019;d left no<br>other traces of my incursion, slipped out, and flew downstairs to see who it<br>was. The last six steps I took in one death-defying bound.<br>Moron, grinny-zitty as ever. His bumfluff&#x2019;s getting thicker, mind. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll<br><i>never </i>guess what!&#x201d;<br>"What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know the lake in the woods?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only&#x201d;&#x2014;Moron checked that we weren&#x2019;t being overheard&#x2014;&#x201c;gone and<br>froze <i>solid</i>! Half the kids in the village&#x2019;re there, right now. <i>Ace </i>doss or what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jason!&#x201d; Mum appeared from the kitchen. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re letting the cold in!<br>Either invite Dean in<i>side&#x2014;</i>hel<i>lo </i>Dean&#x2014;or shut the door.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Um . . . just going out for a bit, Mum.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Um . . . </i>where?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just for some healthy fresh air.&#x201d;<br>That was a strategic mistake. &#x201c;What are you up to?&#x201d;<br>I wanted to say &#x201c;Nothing&#x201d; but Hangman decided not to let me. &#x201c;Why<br>would I be up to anything?&#x201d; I avoided her stare as I put on my navy duffel<br>coat.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your new black parka done to offend you, may I ask?&#x201d;<br>I still couldn&#x2019;t say &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; (Truth is, black means you fancy yourself as<br>a hard-knock. Adults can&#x2019;t be expected to understand.) &#x201c;My duffel&#x2019;s a bit<br>warmer, that&#x2019;s all. It&#x2019;s parky out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lunch is one o&#x2019;clock <i>sharp.</i>&#x201d; Mum went back to changing the Hoover<br>bag. &#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s coming home to eat. Put on a woolly hat or your head&#x2019;ll freeze.&#x201d;<br>Woolly hats&#x2019;re gay but I could stuff it in my pocket later.<br>&#x201c;Good-bye then, Mrs. Taylor,&#x201d; said Moron.<br>&#x201c;Good-bye, Dean,&#x201d; said Mum.<br>Mum&#x2019;s never liked Moron.<br><br>Moron&#x2019;s my height and he&#x2019;s okay but <i>Jesus </i>he pongs of gravy. Moron wears<br>ankle-flappers from charity shops and lives down Druggers End in a brick cottage<br>that pongs of gravy too. His real name&#x2019;s Dean Moran (rhymes with &#x201c;warren&#x201d;)<br>but our P.E. teacher Mr. Carver started calling him &#x201c;Moron&#x201d; in our first<br>week and it&#x2019;s stuck. I call him &#x201c;Dean&#x201d; if we&#x2019;re on our own but name&#x2019;s aren&#x2019;t<br>just names. Kids who&#x2019;re really popular get called by their first names, so Nick<br>Yew&#x2019;s always just &#x201c;Nick.&#x201d; Kids who&#x2019;re a bit popular like Gilbert Swinyard have<br>sort of respectful nicknames like &#x201c;Yardy.&#x201d; Next down are kids like me who call<br>each other by our surnames. Below us are kids with piss-take nicknames like<br>Moran Moron or Nicholas Briar, who&#x2019;s Knickerless Bra. It&#x2019;s all ranks, being a<br>boy, like the army. If I called Gilbert Swinyard just &#x201c;Swinyard,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d kick my<br>face in. Or if I called Moron &#x201c;Dean&#x201d; in front of everyone, it&#x2019;d damage my<br>own standing. So you&#x2019;ve got to watch out.<br>Girls don&#x2019;t do this so much, &#x2019;cept for Dawn Madden, who&#x2019;s a boy gone<br>wrong in some experiment. Girls don&#x2019;t scrap so much as boys either. (That said,<br>just before school broke up for Christmas, Dawn Madden and Andrea Bozard<br>started yelling &#x201c;Bitch!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Slag!&#x201d; in the bus queues after school. Punching<br>tits and pulling hair and everything, they were.) Wish I&#x2019;d been born a girl,<br>sometimes. They&#x2019;re generally loads more civilized. But if I ever admitted that<br>out loud I&#x2019;d get bumhole plummer scrawled on my locker. That happened to<br>Floyd Chaceley for admitting he liked Johann Sebastian Bach. Mind you, if<br>they knew Eliot Bolivar, who gets poems published in <i>Black Swan Green Parish<br>Magazine, </i>was <i>me, </i>they&#x2019;d gouge me to death behind the tennis courts with<br>blunt woodwork tools and spray the Sex Pistols logo on my gravestone.<br>So anyway, as Moron and I walked to the lake he told me about the<br>Scalectrix he&#x2019;d got for Christmas. On Boxing Day its transformer blew up and<br>nearly wiped out his entire family. &#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; I said. But Moron swore it on<br>his nan&#x2019;s grave. So I told him he should write to <i>That&#x2019;s Life </i>on BBC and get<br>Esther Rantzen to make the manufacturer pay compensation. Moron<br>thought that might be difficult &#x2019;cause his dad&#x2019;d bought it off a Brummie at<br>Tewkesbury Market on Christmas Eve. I didn&#x2019;t dare ask what a &#x201c;Brummie&#x201d;<br>was in case it&#x2019;s the same as &#x201c;bummer&#x201d; or &#x201c;bumboy,&#x201d; which means homo.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;see what you mean.&#x201d; Moron asked me what I&#x2019;d got for Christmas.<br>I&#x2019;d actually got �13.50 in book tokens and a poster of Middle-earth, but<br>books&#x2019;re gay so I talked about the Game of Life, which I&#x2019;d got from Uncle<br>Brian and Aunt Alice. It&#x2019;s a board game you win by getting your little car to<br>the end of the road of life first, and with the most money. We crossed the<br>crossroads by the Black Swan and went into the woods. Wished I&#x2019;d rubbed<br>ointment into my lips &#x2019;cause they get chapped when it&#x2019;s this cold.<br>Soon we heard kids through the trees, shouting and screaming. &#x201c;Last one<br>to the lake&#x2019;s a <i>spaz</i>!&#x201d; yelled Moron, haring off before I was ready. Straight off<br>he tripped over a frozen tire rut, went flying, and landed on his arse. Trust<br>Moran. &#x201c;I think I might&#x2019;ve got a concussion,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Concussion&#x2019;s if you hit your head. Unless your brain&#x2019;s up your arse.&#x201d;<br>What a line. Pity nobody who matters was around to hear it.<br><br>The lake in the woods was <i>epic. </i>Tiny bubbles were trapped in the ice like in<br>Fox&#x2019;s Glacier Mints. Neal Brose had proper Olympic ice skates he hired out<br>for 5p a go, though Pete Redmarley was allowed to use them for free so other<br>kids&#x2019;d see him speed-skating around and want a go too. Just staying up on the<br>ice is hard enough. I fell over loads before I got the knack of sliding in my<br>trainers. Ross Wilcox turned up with his cousin Gary Drake <i>and </i>Dawn Mad-<br>den. All three&#x2019;re pretty good skaters. Drake and Wilcox&#x2019;re taller than me too<br>now. (They&#x2019;d cut the fingers off of their gloves to show the scars they&#x2019;d got<br>playing Scabby Queen. Mum&#x2019;d <i>murder </i>me.) Squelch sat on the humpy island<br>in the middle of the lake where the ducks normally live, shouting, &#x201c;<i>Arse<br>over tit! Arse over tit!</i>&#x201d; at whoever fell over. Squelch&#x2019;s funny in the head &#x2019;cause<br>he was born too early, so nobody ever thumps him one. Not hard, anyway.<br>Grant Burch rode his servant Philip Phelps&#x2019;s Raleigh Chopper actually on<br>the ice. He kept his balance for a few seconds, but when he pulled a wheelie<br>the bike went flying. After it landed it looked like Uri Geller&#x2019;d tortured it to<br>death. Phelps grinned sickly. Bet he was wondering what he&#x2019;d tell his dad.<br>Then Pete Redmarley and Grant Burch decided the frozen lake&#x2019;d be perfect<br>for British Bulldogs. Nick Yew said, &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m on for that,&#x201d; so it was decided.<br>I <i>hate </i>British Bulldogs. When Miss Throckmorton banned it at our primary<br>school after Lee Biggs lost three teeth playing it, I was <i>dead </i>relieved. But this<br>morning any kid who denied loving British Bulldogs&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve looked a total<br>ponce. Specially kids from up Kingfisher Meadows like me.<br>About twenty or twenty-five of us boys, plus Dawn Madden, stood in a<br>bunch to be picked like slaves in a slave market. Grant Burch and Nick Yew<br>were joint captains of one team. Pete Redmarley and Gilbert Swinyard were<br>the captains of the other. Ross Wilcox and Gary Drake both got picked before<br>me by Pete Redmarley, but I got picked by Grant Burch on the sixth pass,<br>which wasn&#x2019;t embarrassingly late. Moron and Squelch were the last two left.<br>Grant Burch and Pete Redmarley joked, &#x201c;No, you can have &#x2019;em both, we<br>want to <i>win</i>!&#x201d; and Moron and Squelch had to laugh like they thought it was<br>funny too. Maybe Squelch really did. (Moron didn&#x2019;t. When everyone looked<br>away, he had the same face as that time after we all told him we were playing<br>Hide-and-Seek and sent him off to hide. It took an hour for him to work out<br>nobody was looking for him.) Nick Yew won the toss so us lot were the Runners<br>first and Pete Redmarley&#x2019;s team were the Bulldogs. Unimportant kids&#x2019;<br>coats were put at either end of the lake as goalmouths to reach through and<br>to defend. Girls, apart from Dawn Madden, and the littl&#x2019;uns were cleared off<br>the ice. Redmarley&#x2019;s Bulldogs formed a pack in the middle and us Runners<br>slid to our starting goal. My heart was drumming now. Bulldogs and Runners<br>crouched like sprinters. The captains led the chant.<br>&#x201c;British Bulldogs! One two <i>three</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>Screaming like kamikazes, we charged. I slipped over (accidentally on purpose)<br>just before the front wave of Runners smashed into the Bulldogs. This&#x2019;d<br>tie up most of the hardest Bulldogs in fights with our front Runners. (Bulldogs<br>have to pin down both shoulders of Runners onto the ice for long<br>enough to shout &#x201c;British Bulldogs one two three.&#x201d;) With luck, my strategy&#x2019;d<br>clear some spaces to dodge through and on to our home goalposts. My plan<br>worked pretty well at first. The Tookey brothers and Gary Drake all crashed<br>into Nick Yew. A flying leg kicked my shin but I got past them without coming<br>a cropper. But then Ross Wilcox came homing in on me. I tried to wriggle<br>past but Wilcox got a firm grip on my wrist and tried to pull me down. But<br>instead of trying to struggle free I got a firmer grip on <i>his </i>wrist and flung him<br>off me, straight into Ant Little and Darren Croome. Ace in the <i>face </i>or what?<br>Games and sports aren&#x2019;t about taking part or even about winning. Games and<br>sports&#x2019;re really about humiliating your enemies. Lee Biggs tried a poxy rugby<br>tackle on me but I shook him free <i>no </i>sweat. He&#x2019;s too worried about the teeth<br>he&#x2019;s got left to be a decent Bulldog. I was the fourth Runner home. Grant<br>Burch shouted, &#x201c;Nice work <i>Jacey-</i>boy!&#x201d; Nick Yew&#x2019;d fought free of the Tookeys<br>and Gary Drake and got home too. About a third of the Runners got captured<br>and turned into Bulldogs for the next pass. I hate that about British Bulldogs.<br>It forces you to be a traitor.<br>So anyway, we all chanted, &#x201c;British Bulldogs one two THREE!&#x201d; and<br>charged like last time but this time I had no chance. Ross Wilcox <i>and </i>Gary<br>Drake <i>and </i>Dawn Madden targeted me from the start. No matter how I tried<br>to dodge through the fray it was hopeless. I hadn&#x2019;t got halfway across the lake<br>before they got me. Ross Wilcox went for my legs, Gary Drake toppled me,<br>and Dawn Madden sat on my chest and pinned my shoulders down with her<br>knees. I just lay there and let them convert me into a Bulldog. In my heart I&#x2019;d<br>always be a Runner. Gary Drake gave me a dead leg, which might or might<br>not&#x2019;ve been on purpose. Dawn Madden&#x2019;s got cruel eyes like a Chinese empress<br>and sometimes one glimpse at school makes me think about her all day.<br>Ross Wilcox jumped up and punched the air like he&#x2019;d scored at Old Trafford.<br>The spazzo. &#x201c;Yeah, yeah, Wilcox,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;three against one, well done.&#x201d;<br>Wilcox flashed me a V-sign and slid off for another battle. Grant Burch and<br>Nick Yew came windmilling at a thick pocket of Bulldogs and half of them<br>went flying.<br>Then Gilbert Swinyard yelled at the top of his lungs, &#x201c;<i>PIIIIIILEONNNNNN!</i>&#x201d;<br>That was the signal for every Runner and every Bulldog on<br>the lake to throw themselves onto a wriggling, groaning, growing pyramid of<br>kids. The game itself was sort of forgotten. I held back, pretending to limp a<br>bit from my dead leg. Then we heard the sound of a chain saw in the woods,<br>flying down the track, straight toward us.<br><br>The chain saw wasn&#x2019;t a chain saw. It was Tom Yew on his purple Suzuki<br>150cc scrambler. Pluto Noak was clinging to the back, without a helmet.<br>British Bulldogs was aborted &#x2019;cause Tom Yew&#x2019;s a minor legend in Black<br>Swan Green. Tom Yew serves in the Royal Navy on a frigate called HMS<br><i>Coventry. </i>Tom Yew&#x2019;s got every Led Zep album ever made <i>and </i>can play the<br>guitar introduction to &#x201c;Stairway to Heaven.&#x201d; Tom Yew&#x2019;s actually shaken<br>hands with Peter Shilton, the England goalkeeper. Pluto Noak&#x2019;s a less shiny<br>legend. He left school without even taking his CSEs last year. Now he<br>works in the Pork Scratchings factory in Upton-on-Severn. (There&#x2019;s rumors<br>Pluto Noak&#x2019;s smoked cannabis but obviously it wasn&#x2019;t the type that cauliflowerizes<br>your brain and makes you jump off roofs onto railings.)

Lee and Ulysses S. Grant. </p><p>The fighting climaxed in the decisive breakthrough by the Union Sixth Corps on April 2, just six miles southwest of Petersburg. This Federal victory forced Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond that night, and to surrender his army just one week later. </p><p>Will Greene, executive director of Pamplin Historical Park, which preserves the Breakthrough Battlefield, places these long-neglected battles in strategic context while providing the first tactically-detailed account of the combat on April 2, 1865. A. Wilson Greene is also the author of Whatever You Resolve to Be, a collection of essays on Stonewall Jackson.</p></p><p></p><h2>Atonement</h2><p>The novel opens on a sweltering summer day in 1935 at the Tallis family&#x2019;s mansion in the Surrey countryside. Thirteen-year-old Briony has written a play in honor of the visit of her adored older brother Leon; other guests include her three young cousins -- refugees from their parent&#x2019;s marital breakup -- Leon&#x2019;s friend Paul Marshall, the manufacturer of a chocolate bar called &#x201c;Amo&#x201d; that soldiers will be able to carry into war, and Robbie Turner, the son of the family charlady whose brilliantly successful college career has been funded by Mr. Tallis. Jack Tallis is absent from the gathering; he spends most of his time in London at the War Ministry and with his mistress. His wife Emily is a semi-invalid, nursing chronic migraine headaches. Their elder daughter Cecilia is also present; she has just graduated from Cambridge and is at home for the summer, restless and yearning for her life to really begin. Rehearsals for Briony&#x2019;s play aren&#x2019;t going well; her cousin Lola has stolen the starring role, the twin boys can&#x2019;t speak the lines properly, and Briony suddenly realizes that her destiny is to be a novelist, not a dramatist.<br><br>In the midst of the long hot afternoon, Briony happens to be watching from a window when Cecilia strips off her clothes and plunges into the fountain on the lawn as Robbie looks on. Later that evening, Briony thinks she sees Robbie attacking Cecilia in the library, she reads a note meant for Cecilia, her cousin Lola is sexually assaulted, and she makes an accusation that she will repent for the rest of her life.<br><br>The next two parts of <b>Atonement</b> shift to the spring of 1940 as Hitler&#x2019;s forces are sweeping across the Low Countries and into France. Robbie Turner, wounded, joins the disastrous British retreat to Dunkirk. Instead of going up to Cambridge to begin her studies, Briony has become a nurse in one of London&#x2019;s military hospitals. The fourth and final section takes place in 1999, as Briony celebrates her 77th birthday with the completion of a book about the events of 1935 and 1940, a novel called <b>Atonement</b>.<br><br>In its<i> </i>broad historical framework <b>Atonement</b><i> </i>is a departure from McEwan&#x2019;s earlier work, and he loads the story with an emotional intensity and a gripping plot reminiscent of the best nineteenth-century fiction. Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war, England and class, the novel is a profoundly moving exploration of shame and forgiveness and the difficulty of absolution.</p><p>Ian McEwan's Booker Prize-nominated <i>Atonement</i> is his first novel since <i>Amsterdam</i> took home the prize in 1998. But while <i>Amsterdam</i> was a slim, sleek piece, <i>Atonement</i> is a more sturdy, more ambitious work, allowing McEwan more room to play, think, and experiment.<p> We meet 13-year-old Briony Tallis in the summer of 1935, as she attempts to stage a production of her new drama "The Trials of Arabella" to welcome home her older, idolized brother Leon. But she soon discovers that her cousins, the glamorous Lola and the twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, aren't up to the task, and directorial ambitions are abandoned as more interesting prospects of preoccupation come onto the scene. The charlady's son, Robbie Turner, appears to be forcing Briony's sister Cecilia to strip in the fountain and sends her obscene letters; Leon has brought home a dim chocolate magnate keen for a war to promote his new "Army Ammo" chocolate bar; and upstairs, Briony's migraine-stricken mother Emily keeps tabs on the house from her bed. Soon, secrets emerge that change the lives of everyone present....</p><p> The interwar, upper-middle-class setting of the book's long, masterfully sustained opening section might recall Virginia Woolf or Henry Green, but as we move forward--eventually to the turn of the 21st century--the novel's central concerns emerge, and McEwan's voice becomes clear, even personal. For at heart, <i>Atonement</i> is about the pleasures, pains, and dangers of writing, and perhaps even more, about the challenge of controlling what readers make of your writing. McEwan shouldn't have any doubts about readers of <i>Atonement</i>: this is a thoughtful, provocative, and at times moving book that will have readers applauding. <i>--Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her older sister Cecilia strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching Cecilia is their housekeeper's son Robbie Turner, a childhood friend who, along with Briony's sister, has recently graduated from Cambridge. <br>By the end of that day the lives of all three will have been changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had never before dared to approach and will have become victims of the younger girl's scheming imagination. And Briony will have committed a dreadful crime, the guilt for which will color her entire life. <br>In each of his novels Ian McEwan has brilliantly drawn his reader into the intimate lives and situations of his characters. But never before has he worked with so large a canvas: In "Atonement he takes the reader from a manor house in England in 1935 to the retreat from Dunkirk in 1941; from the London's World War II military hospitals to a reunion of the Tallis clan in 1999. <br>"Atonement is Ian McEwan's finest achievement. Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war, England and class, the novel is at its center a profound-and profoundly moving-exploration of shame and forgiveness and the difficulty of absolution.</p><h2>German English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)</h2><p>Newly revised and updated, the <i>German-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> is a quick and intuitive way to learn and recall everyday words in German. <p>The <i>German-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> introduces a range of useful current vocabulary in thematic order, using full-color photographs and artworks to display and label all the elements of everyday life &#x2014; from the home and office to sport, music, nature, and the countries of the world &#x2014; with panel features on key nouns, verbs, and useful phrases.</p> <p>The <i>German-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> features:</p> <ul> <li>A quick and intuitive way to learn and remember thousands of words.</li> <li>A complete range of illustrated objects and scenes from everyday life.</li> <li>Fast and effective learning for any situation, from home and office to shopping and dining out.</li> <li>Detailed index for instant reference.</li> <li>Handy size ideal for travel.</li> </ul> <p>The illustrations in the <i>German-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> provide a quick and intuitive route to learning a language, defining the words visually so it is easier to remember them and creating a colorful and stimulating learning resource for the foreign-language and EFL/ESL student.</p></p><p>DK was founded in London in 1974 and is now the world's leading illustrated reference publisher and part of Penguin Random House, formed on July 1, 2013.

Rowling is today: author of a series of children&#39;s books which shaped the imagination of a generation. Rooted in the heyday of the British Empire, Swallows and Amazons and its sequels described a nostalgic Utopia.Yet before that, Arthur Ransome was famous for different reasons. Between 1917 and 1924, as Russian correspondent for the Daily News and Manchester Guardian, he was an uncritical apologist for the Bolshevik regime, with unique access to the revolutionary leaders. As the Red Army engaged with an Allied invasion of Russia, Ransome was conducting a love affair with Evgenia Shelepina, private secretary to Leon Trotsky, then Soviet Commissar for War. As the intimate friend of Karl Radek, the Bolshevik Chief of Propaganda, he denied the Red Terror and compared Lenin to Oliver Cromwell. No English journalist was considered more controversial, or more damaging to British security. At Whitehall, he was accused of being the paid agent of a hostile power and only narrowly escaped prosecution for treason. This is a fascinating, often chilling revision of an English icon through the most formative decade of the twentieth century.</p><p>Roland Chambers is a biographer and children&#39;s book author. He divides his time between London and Connecticut.This sturdy biography contains some surprises for those readers who know Ransome (1884&#x2013;1967) as the author of the Swallows and Amazons series of children&#x2019;s books. As it turns out, Ransome was also a political journalist, a spy for the British SIS, and an outspoken defender of the Russian Revolution&#x2014;all of this before he wrote the gentle children&#x2019;s stories with which he is most closely associated. This is one of those biographies that succeeds on the strength of its story rather than on the liveliness of its writing, which is staid and scholarly. But the life itself is so compelling, and so unexpectedly full of intrigue, that we are kept, if not spellbound, at least too interested to put the book down. Ransome scholars and fans of the children&#x2019;s series will be drawn to the book, of course, but it will also prove satisfying to readers with an interest in the period surrounding the Russian Revolution. Like American journalist John Reed, Ransome witnessed the upheaval from the inside, not merely as an observer of events but as an involved participant. --David Pitt</p><h2>Spirit of Fire--Millennial Quest</h2><p>The Millennial Quest Series chronicles a family&#x2019;s journey from our time to the Second Coming of Christ, into the Millennium, and finally back through their pre-mortal lives to discover the startling reasons things occur in mortality as they do. This series is unlike any other, in that it tenderly follows their existence through four separate very real world--earth life, millennial life, after-life, and pre-mortality. <p>This bok is the first installment in this sweeping drama. Through heart-warming events and real-life tragedies, their lives are traced through the struggles and triumphs which bring them the great blessings sought by the faithful of every age. This is a timeless romance of lives forever intertwined, of vast blessings gained at incredible cost. It is an immensely engaging story for all who have pondered the sweeping drama of existence, or who have gazed upn the battlefields of life, and wondered why.</p></p><p></p><h2>Needlework Framing (Library of Professional Picture Framing, Vol. 3)</h2><p>Step-by-step instructions!

With a thorough roundup of basic tools and techniques (including many variations) and a 20-page section charting dozens of easy motifs, the volume is an ideal crash course for the beginner or novice. But there's far more here--24 projects, all accompanied by complete step-by-step instructions, materials lists, line drawings, and color photos that offer ample temptation for the more experienced stitcher. In addition to a slew of projects featuring traditional cross-stitch, there are also full directions and projects for other counted thread techniques: pattern darning, blackwork, pulled work, hardanger, and drawn thread work. Projects include pictures, pillows, towels, curtains, a tote bag, and a lampshade. The pieces have a lovely old-fashioned look that wisely avoids the cutesiness often prevalent in the medium. <i>--Amy Handy</i>Cross-stitch is just one of a variety of counted thread techniques worked primarily on even weave fabric. These books are good examples of two different approaches to writing a cross-stitch project book: the process-oriented approach and the project-oriented approach. Van Zandt (Christmas Stockings in Cross-Stich, Meredith, 1992) assumes that the reader is a beginner interested in learning various counted thread techniques (cross-stitch, blackwork, pattern darning, pulled work, hardanger, and drawn thread work) and then expanding upon what has been learned to create original designs. She includes an assortment of attractive and challenging projects, but clearly the process of learning and creating is as important as the projects in this book. In contrast, Kooler assumes that the reader is already proficient at cross-stitch and wishes to make attractive projects for the home. An artisan with her own studio, she presents 40 designs in pleasing room-by-room groupings, including full directions, materials, step-by-step instructions, and oversized graphs for each. Both volumes avoid trendy designs that might quickly date the projects and both are sturdily bound, with clear color illustrations and photos. Both are recommended for public libraries, but if you can only purchase one, Van Zandt's is the better choice because it goes beyond projects, which are readily available in needlework magazines.

But would her dreams last past the stroke of midnight?<br> <br><i>They never have before.</i><br> <br>Normally an optimist, Charlotte Adams didn&#x2019;t usually worry about the future or think about the past. She&#x2019;d deliberately lived in the present for more than a decade. But the past few weeks of hectic holidays, family changes, and now the flipping of the calendar made her feel . . . restless. She glanced around the crowded room, wondering if she could make an escape.<br> <br>The mayor, Robert Monroe, and his wife, Theresa, had invited half the town to their New Year&#x2019;s Eve party so they could show off their new home, the stately Sandstone Manor. Sitting on a bluff on the north end of Angel&#x2019;s Bay, the grand old estate had fallen into disrepair over the past thirty years at the hands of a wealthy, eccentric recluse. The hundred-year-old, seven-bedroom, five-bath house with the castlelike turrets, dramatic bay windows, and alleged ghosts had always fascinated the town, and when it had come up for sale two months ago, the Monroes had snapped it up. Everyone who&#x2019;d been lucky enough to get an invitation to tonight&#x2019;s party had accepted, dying to get a look inside.<br> <br>Charlotte made her way through the living room, past the dining-room buffet tables laden with shrimp and crab, and into the kitchen, where a busy catering staff didn&#x2019;t give her a second look. She slipped out a side door onto a patio overlooking the sea and reveled in the blessed quiet.<br> <br>It was a dark night, the moon and stars hidden behind the fog that had rolled in after dusk. The cold, misty breeze felt good against her face. Maybe she could stay out here until the party died down. There would be questions if she tried to ditch before midnight. Most of her friends were inside, and they wanted her to be as happy as they were.<br> <br>Sighing, she rested her arms on the wood railing, thinking about how many changes they&#x2019;d all gone through in the last year. Colin had recovered from his shooting, and he and Kara were a family now, their baby getting bigger each day. Jason and Brianna were about to start the new year no longer enemies but lovers. And Lauren and Shane were getting married in two weeks.<br> <br>Everyone was settling down, and this party was making her wonder what the hell she was doing with her own life. She had a good career and loved being an ob/gyn, but her personal life was another story. She&#x2019;d always had great friendships with men, but relationships . . . She had trouble letting anyone get too close to her heart. She never wanted to get hurt again.<br> <br>The door opened behind her, followed by Kara&#x2019;s cheerful voice. &#x201c;Charlotte, I&#x2019;ve been looking all over for you. It&#x2019;s almost midnight. What are you doing out here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Getting some air,&#x201d; she said with a smile, hoping her friend wouldn&#x2019;t see past it.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s freezing,&#x201d; Kara said with a shiver as she wrapped her arms around herself, her dark red hair blowing in the breeze.<br> <br>&#x201c;It feels good,&#x201d; Charlotte replied, although her short black party dress was no better defense against the winter wind than Kara&#x2019;s turquoise mini.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Kara asked, giving her a speculative look.<br> <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like New Year&#x2019;s Eve. Everyone makes such a big deal about it, and the night never lives up to its hype. I&#x2019;d just as soon skip the whole thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would your cynical mood have something to do with a man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kara raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Really? Because I thought you were coming with Andrew, and he&#x2019;s nowhere in sight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Something came up. He said he&#x2019;d try to get here before midnight, but who knows?&#x201d; Having grown up with a minister for a father, she knew the demands of Andrew&#x2019;s job. Her father had missed many important occasions in her life. She&#x2019;d learned early on to lower her expectations.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Andrew won&#x2019;t miss a chance to kiss you at midnight,&#x201d; Kara said.<br> <br>Charlotte smiled, Kara&#x2019;s words triggering an old memory. &#x201c;Actually, he missed a New Year&#x2019;s Eve kiss once before. Senior year in high school, I was so excited to finally have a boyfriend on New Year&#x2019;s that I spent all my money on an incredibly hot dress. But Andrew got the flu and spent the night hurling his guts, and I wound up sitting home alone. Just another example of New Year&#x2019;s Eve not living up to its promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kara&#x2019;s eyes sparkled with amusement. &#x201c;That is a sad story, but you were never a loser.&#x201d; She paused, her expression growing more concerned. &#x201c;I hope someone isn&#x2019;t in trouble and that&#x2019;s why Andrew isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t give me any details when he called.&#x201d; When he&#x2019;d suggested meeting here tonight, she&#x2019;d been relieved. Coming to the party together in front of the entire town would have been quite a statement, and she wasn&#x2019;t ready for that yet. Andrew Schilling was a big part of her past, but their future was still to be decided.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to freeze out here,&#x201d; Kara said. &#x201c;You should have picked somewhere warmer to hide out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s invigorating&#x2014;the cold wind, the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks below. It gets your blood pumping.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The fog is frizzing my hair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So go inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not without you. I&#x2019;m worried about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll be fine tomorrow,&#x201d; Charlotte reassured her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you be? Or will you just have your guard back up?&#x201d;<br> <br>They&#x2019;d known each other since they were kids, and Kara was very good at reading between the lines and seeing the truth behind a lie.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t go back in, your husband will send out a search party,&#x201d; she teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d need one in this huge place. It&#x2019;s even more spectacular than I imagined,&#x201d; Kara said. &#x201c;Theresa certainly got everything she ever wanted.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte nodded. &#x201c;I knew Robert came from money, but I didn&#x2019;t realize the Monroes were this wealthy. This house must have cost a fortune.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One of Robert&#x2019;s uncles recently passed away and left him a bundle. Did you see the diamond necklace Theresa&#x2019;s wearing? It originally belonged to Edward Worthington&#x2019;s wife; it was still around her neck when she washed up dead onshore after the shipwreck.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte made a face. &#x201c;Thanks for the visual.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kara grinned. &#x201c;Sorry. But I just think it&#x2019;s interesting that Theresa bought herself a link to the shipwreck. She always hated that her family wasn&#x2019;t connected to the survivors who founded Angel&#x2019;s Bay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever it takes, I guess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d feel happier for her good fortune if she&#x2019;d been a little nicer to us in high school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte nodded in agreement. Theresa and her beautiful band of cheerleaders had been a year older than Charlotte, and they&#x2019;d ruled the school with their own brand of meanness. But Theresa&#x2019;s younger sister, Pamela, had been Charlotte&#x2019;s personal nemesis.<br> <br>&#x201c;So can we go in now?&#x201d; Kara pleaded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m going to leave. If anyone asks, just say I had a patient to check on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kara sighed. &#x201c;Fine, but I wish you would wait. You could miss out on an awesome kiss.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my chances.&#x201d;<br> <br>When they returned to the party, Kara was swept into conversation with Colin and another couple, so Charlotte slipped through the crowd.<br> <br>As she turned into the hallway, the front door opened, and Andrew walked in wearing gray slacks and a white button-down shirt under a dark sports coat. Her heart skipped a beat as she took in the tall, lean, golden man with bright blue eyes and an irresistible smile. The first time she&#x2019;d talked to him, she was sixteen; he&#x2019;d asked her for a pencil in math class. From that moment on, she&#x2019;d spent hours doodling their names together and trying to run into him accidentally on purpose.<br> <br>Andrew had been one of the most popular guys in high school, and dating him had seemed like an impossible dream. She wasn&#x2019;t one of the cheerleaders or the wild girls who seemed to surround him. But somehow, on one of those &#x201c;accidental&#x201d; meetings, they&#x2019;d started talking, and he&#x2019;d asked her to hang out after a football game. From there, they&#x2019;d become inseparable. With Andrew, she&#x2019;d felt prettier, smarter, more self-confident, and wildly in love. Then the rug had been pulled out from under her. Sixteen and on top of the world turned into eighteen and as sad as could be.<br> <br>She watched as Andrew made his way down the hall, hampered by the effusive Kelleher sisters, who smothered him with hugs and kisses and high-pitched conversation. The sisters were both divorced, in their late thirties, and they hung out in the local bars on Saturday nights trolling for eligible men. Apparently, they had Andrew in their sights.<br> <br>Before she could make a move to rescue him, the front door opened again. Joe Silveira entered with a purposeful step, dressed in black slacks, a dark gray shirt, and a black leather jacket. The sexy chief of police was night to Andrew&#x2019;s day. Joe had thick dark brown hair, olive skin, intense eyes, and a rough edge that had been sharpened by his career as a cop. He was more rugged and less polished than Andrew. And where Andrew was talkative and outgoing, Joe kept most of his thoughts to himself.<br> <br>Living in Angel&#x2019;s Bay almost a year now, Joe was well respected but kept most people at a distance. He rarely let down his guard, but on occasion she had seen the simmering passion just beneath the surface and wondered what he&#x2019;d be like if he ever let go of the tight control he exercised over his life and his emotions.<br> <br>It had been weeks since she&#x2019;d seen him. He&#x2019;d gone to L.A. just after Thanksgiving, when his father suffered a stroke. She&#x2019;d almost forgotten how attractive he was, how her stomach flipped every time she saw him, how his smoking-hot body made her face flush and her heart race. Definite heartbreaking potential.<br> <br>She should have left the party sooner&#x2014;both men&#x2019;s gazes were in search of someone, and she knew that someone was her.<br> <br>A man in the crowd suddenly shouted, &#x201c;One minute to midnight.&#x201d;<br> <br>She felt an overwhelming desire to run for her life.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thirty seconds!&#x201d;<br> <br>Andrew and Joe were moving down the hall, drawing closer. What was she going to do? Kiss one, then the other? She&#x2019;d been caught between the two men before, and it was not a happy place to be.<br> <br>She turned and fled. The grand staircase was the only open path, so she ran up the stairs, ignoring the surprised look of a passing maid. She could find refuge in some bathroom, she hoped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten, nine, eight . . .&#x201d; The chant from the crowd grew louder.<br> <br>She turned one corner, then another. The huge house was perfect for hiding out. She moved farther down the hall, stopping abruptly as the lights went out.<br> <br>Surprised cries and nervous screams echoed through the house, along with shouts of &#x201c;Happy New Year.&#x201d; What the hell happened?<br> <br>Someone brushed against her shoulder, knocking her slightly off balance, then the shadowy figure was gone. How could they move so quickly through the darkness?<br> <br>Turning around, she put her hand on the wall to find her way back to the staircase. A chorus of &#x201c;Auld Lang Syne&#x201d; rang out from below. The blackout hadn&#x2019;t dimmed the party&#x2019;s champagne-fueled spirits. She followed the noise, glad when small flickering lights appeared. Someone had lit some candles. She reached the staircase with relief, her hand hitting the banister as the lights came back on. She blinked, then moved quickly down the stairs.<br> <br>She had just reached the bottom step when she heard shrill screams from above. It took a moment for them to register over the party chatter, but as the screams continued, the crowd hushed.<br> <br>Then the housekeeper appeared at the top of the staircase. &#x201c;Mrs. Monroe!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s dead!&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe Silveira pushed through the shocked hush of the crowded hallway. He&#x2019;d had a bad feeling when the lights went out, and now he knew why. Charlotte gave him a shocked look as he passed her, and she started to follow, but he waved her back. He needed to find out what was going on first. One of his officers, Colin Lynch, jogged up the stairs behind him.<br> <br>When they reached the landing, the housekeeper burst into an agitated mix of Spanish and English as she led them down the hallway and waved them toward an open door.<br> <br>The master bedroom was a picture of luxury: thick carpet, a huge king-size bed with an ornately carved frame, and a sitting area with a fireplace and a big-screen television. He registered the details with efficiency. The room was too messy for a party night; the drawers in the dresser were half open, and there was a scent of perfume in the air. As he moved further inside, his pulse jumped at the sight of the beautiful, skinny blonde sprawled on the floor between the bedroom and the bathroom.<br> <br>Theresa Monroe was on her back, her skin pale against her bright red cocktail dress. Her short blond hair was streaked with blood, a pool appearing under the back of her head, which rested on the marble floor.<br> <br>He squatted down next to her and put a hand to her neck. Her pulse was faint but present, and he could hear the whisper of her breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s alive,&#x201d; he told Colin, who was already calling for an ambulance.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Charlotte.&#x201d; Colin jogged out of the room.<br> <br>Joe grabbed two thick towels off the rack and covered Theresa. The mayor rushed into the room a moment later. He was a tall, balding man with a bit of gut stretching the buttons on his white silk shirt. His eyes widened in shock when he saw his wife. His mouth opened, but no words came. It was the first time Joe had ever seen him speechless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; Monroe finally got out, dropping to his knees.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s breathing,&#x201d; Joe quickly reassured him. &#x201c;Paramedics are on the way. Colin went downstairs to find a doctor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert touched his wife&#x2019;s bare shoulder. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s so cold.&#x201d; His gaze moved to the pool of blood, and he drew in a shaky breath. &#x201c;What&#x2014;what happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know yet. Your housekeeper found her like this a few minutes ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just outside checking the lights. Do you think she slipped in the dark?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; he replied, his mind racing through a few other scenarios. He glanced down at Theresa, noting the red scratch marks on her neck. &#x201c;Was your wife wearing a necklace?&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert&#x2019;s jaw dropped. &#x201c;Yes. Oh, my God! It was a diamond necklace dating back to the shipwreck. It&#x2019;s quite valuable.&#x201d; His gaze dropped to his wife&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Her wedding ring is gone, too.&#x201d; He stared at Joe in confusion and disbelief. &#x201c;Someone robbed her, right here in our home, in the middle of a party. Who would do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then, Colin returned with Charlotte and Ray Bennington, an ER doctor at the clinic. Joe stood up and moved out of the doorway, allowing the doctors a closer look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jason just arrived,&#x201d; Colin informed him. &#x201c;Davidson is on his way to handle forensics.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. Because it looks like Mrs. Monroe&#x2019;s diamonds are missing&#x2014;at least, the ones she was wearing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn. The blackout was planned?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never believed in coincidences. Get Sheila over here, too. We&#x2019;re going to need her to search the female guests while Davidson takes prints.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on it.&#x201d; Colin passed the paramedics on his way out of the room.<br> <br>Charlotte stepped out of the bathroom as the paramedics joined Dr. Bennington. Her blue eyes were worried as her gaze met Joe&#x2019;s. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in b...</p><h2>Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art</h2><p><p><i>Background Noise</i> follows the development of sound as an artistic medium and illustrates how sound is put to use within modes of composition, installation, and performance. While chronological in its structure, Brandon LaBelle's book is informed by spatial thinking - weaving architecture, environments, and the specifics of location into the work of sound, with the aim of formulating an expansive history and understanding of sound art. </p><p>At its center the book presupposes an intrinsic relation between sound and its location, galvanizing acoustics, sound phenomena, and the environmental with the tensions inherent in what LaBelle identifies as sound's <i>relational </i>dynamic. For the author, this is embedded within sound's tendency to <i>become public</i> expressed in its ability to travel distances, foster cultural expression, and define spaces while being radically flexible.</p><p>How does sound embed us within local environments while connecting us to a broader circumference? What consequence does sound art have for notions of spatiality and site-specific practice? Can we engage questions of identity and subjective experience in relation to listening and the resonance of place? Such questions are addressed through consideration of the work of a range of artists, musicians, performers, and composers, including Vito Acconci, Maryanne Amacher, Michael Asher, John Cage, Bill Fontana, Christof Migone, Max Neuhaus, Yasunao Tone, Achim Wollscheid, and Iannis Xenakis. </p><p>Intersecting material analysis with theoretical frameworks spanning art and architectural theory, performance studies, and media theory, <i>Background Noise</i> makes the case that sound art should be at the core of contemporary culture. </p><p>America's First Women Philosophers is indexed in H.W.

Described by her friend Dolly Bantry as &#x201c;the typical old maid of fiction,&#x201d; Miss Marple has lived almost her entire life in the sleepy hamlet of St. Mary Mead. Yet, by observing village life she has gained an unparalleled insight into human nature&#x2014;and used it to devastating effect. As her friend Sir Henry Clithering, the ex-Commissioner of Scotland Yard, has been heard to say: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just the finest detective God ever made&#x201d;&#x2014;and many Agatha Christie fans would agree.</p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, the most popular detective since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime and her works have sold over two billion copies -- 80 crime books, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.</p><h2>Jade</h2><p>Covers all the major and lesser-known areas for jade production.</p><p>This survey of jade use around the world is actually an anthology of essays by prominent scholars. First, a gemologist explains the minerology of jade. Then a series of essays on jade use in China, from prehistory to the present, takes up about half of the book. Finally, shorter essays address jade use in Japan, the South Pacific, Europe, Burma, India, and the Americas. Excellent photographs throughout the volume capture the visual qualities that make jade so appealing. The ambitiousness of its scope makes this survey a valuable addition to the jade literature, but the contributions of the authors vary so widely in method and tone that the volume lacks unity. Suitable for general readers, interested laypersons, and students, though scholarly readers may find some sections of interest.<br><i>- Kathryn W.

He and his wife, Anna, and their family went to Los Angeles in December 1904. Shortly thereafter, their oldest daughter, Esther, who was just three years old, died. This heartbreaking loss made a deep impact on Bartleman and led him to rededicate his life to God's service. He was a participant in the Azusa revival and other early Pentecostal meetings in the Los Angeles area. Bartleman was an itinerant evangelist for 43 years, eventually preaching across the United States and all over the world. He wrote more than 500 articles, 100 tracts, and six books. He is remembered for his passion for increased unity and spiritual renewal among Pentecostals.</p><h2>East Meets West: Global Design for Contemporary Interiors</h2><p>Travelers have long returned from the East to their homes in the West, bringing back beautiful objects and knowledge of the unique philosophy and aesthetic of Eastern culture. Now global travel is a major influence on interior design, and there is new momentum in the melding of Eastern and Western styles as barriers and restrictions between cultures dissolve.<br><br><i>East Meets West </i>offers inspiration for comfortable, harmonious interiors where differences in the age and origin of objects are unimportant. With her contemporary sense of color, texture, and simplicity, Kelly Hoppen creates rooms in which Tibetan heads are face to face with classical busts on a mantelpiece, and Balinese baskets and Chinese lacquerware complement French furniture and English country fabrics. Textiles, wall and window treatments, and upholstery are key elements in this simple yet exotic style, allowing passage from one century to another without any sense of discord. Kelly Hoppen also reveals secrets of palette and texture that tie diverse influences together.<br><br>Over 200 color photographs show Kelly Hoppen's clean-lined and contemporary signature style in spaces constructed with an eye to the function and necessities of everyday life. Whether you are an adventurer or collector, a designer or a home decorator,<i> East Meets West </i>is the new word on easy, sophisticated interiors combining world-wide influences in an utterly personal style.<br></p><p><b>Kelly Hoppen </b>is a British interior designer whose commissions have taken her from Manhattan and Long Island to London, and have included the homes of prestigious fashion designers and collectors. Her work has been featured in international magazines including<i> Elle Decoration</i>, and in 1996 she was awarded the first British Interior Designer of the Year award.<br><br><b>Bill Batten </b>specializes in interior photography and is renowned for his sensitive lighting techniques.

She currently writes for <i>The Independent Magazine</i>.<br>These profusely illustrated books explore the design styles of two internationally renowned British interior designers. Hoppen shows her personal design style of taking North African and Asian designs and items and incorporating them into contemporary interiors. The layout of the photographs provides a nice juxtaposition of images, such as a green rice paddy or an Algerian wrought iron gate with an interpretation of how that color, shape, or texture is used in residential decor. Stefanidis allows us to visit his home, which he created from cow sheds in Dorset, England. The book proceeds room by room and through the gardens, with the chatty text explaining his approach to interior design and landscaping; it even includes recipes to make the reader feel a welcome guest.

By the medieval period the Grail was to be found at the centre of the Christian church, within its liturgy and art. This superb book tells the history of the Grail from its origins in romance literature to its role as a central object of the Christian faith, its decline during the Reformation and its resurgance in recent years, devoid of its religious connotations. The intricacies and complexities of its meaning throughout history are explored in detail, especially its links with Joseph of Arimathea, with Christ&#39;s blood and the Last Supper, its power as a restorer and sustainer of life, and its mysticism in general. Whether a dish, bowl, vessel or chalice, the Grail became an exciting topic for later writers and theologians to explore and utilise, and Richard Barber suggests why this was the case. Well written, detailed and thoroughly absorbing, this is an excellent book.</p><p><b>Richard Barber</b> is one of Britain's leading authorities on medieval history and the author of <i>The Penguin Guide to Medieval Europe</i> and <i>The Knight and Chivalry</i>.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/BARHOL_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm</h2><p>Traces the history of the American aptitude for invention and technology, from the development of the incandescent light and the radio through to the Manhattan Project and the space program</p><p>The book that helped earn Thomas P.

"Sweet relationships are dead."<br>But now Lillian herself is dead. Found among the bleeding hearts and lilacs of Clara Morrow's garden in Three Pines, shattering the celebrations of Clara's solo show at the famed Musee in Montreal. Chief Inspector Gamache, the head of homicide at the Surete du Quebec, is called to the tiny Quebec village and there he finds the art world gathered, and with it a world of shading and nuance, a world of shadow and light. Where nothing is as it seems. Behind every smile there lurks a sneer. Inside every sweet relationship there hides a broken heart. And even when facts are slowly exposed, it is no longer clear to Gamache and his team if what they've found is the truth, or simply a trick of the light.</p><p>LOUISE PENNY is the #1 &#34;New York Times &#34;and &#34;Globe and Mail &#34;bestselling author of more than ten Chief Inspector Armand Gamache novels.

She lives in a small village south of Montreal.A TRICK OF THE LIGHT (Chapter 1)<p></p><p>Oh, no, no, no, thought Clara Morrow as she walked toward the closed doors.</p><p>She could see shadows, shapes, like wraiths moving back and forth, back and forth across the frosted glass. Appearing and disappearing. Distorted, but still human.</p><p>Still the dead one lay moaning.</p><p>The words had been going through her head all day, appearing and disappearing. A poem, half remembered. Words floating to the surface, then going under. The body of the poem beyond her grasp.</p><p>What was the rest of it?</p><p>It seemed important.</p><p>Oh, no no no.</p><p>The blurred figures at the far end of the long corridor seemed almost liquid, or smoke. There, but insubstantial. Fleeting. Fleeing.</p><p>As she wished she could.</p><p>This was it. The end of the journey. Not just that day&#x2019;s journey as she and her husband, Peter, had driven from their little Qu�bec village into the Mus�e d&#x2019;Art Contemporain in Montr�al, a place they knew well. Intimately. How often had they come to the MAC to marvel at some new exhibition? To support a friend, a fellow artist? Or to just sit quietly in the middle of the sleek gallery, in the middle of a weekday, when the rest of the city was at work?</p><p>Art was their work. But it was more than that. It had to be. Otherwise, why put up with all those years of solitude? Of failure? Of silence from a baffled and even bemused art world?</p><p>She and Peter had worked away, every day, in their small studios in their small village, leading their tiny lives. Happy. But still yearning for more.</p><p>Clara took a few more steps down the long, long, white marble hallway.</p><p>This was the &#x201c;more.&#x201d; Through those doors. Finally. The end point of everything she&#x2019;d worked toward, walked toward, all her life.</p><p>Her first dream as a child, her last dream that morning, almost fifty years later, was at the far end of the hard white hallway.</p><p>They&#x2019;d both expected Peter would be the first through those doors. He was by far the more successful artist, with his exquisite studies of life in close-up. So detailed, and so close that a piece of the natural world appeared distorted and abstract. Unrecognizable. Peter took what was natural and made it appear unnatural.</p><p>People ate it up. Thank God. It kept food on the table and the wolves, while constantly circling their little home in Three Pines, were kept from the door. Thanks to Peter and his art.</p><p>Clara glanced at him walking slightly ahead of her, a smile on his handsome face. She knew most people, on first meeting them, never took her for his wife. Instead they assumed some slim executive with a white wine in her elegant hand was his mate. An example of natural selection. Of like moving to like.</p><p>The distinguished artist with the head of graying hair and noble features could not possibly have chosen the woman with the beer in her boxing glove hands. And the p�t� in her frizzy hair. And the studio full of sculptures made out of old tractor parts and paintings of cabbages with wings.</p><p>No. Peter Morrow could not have chosen her. That would have been unnatural.</p><p>And yet he had.</p><p>And she had chosen him.</p><p>Clara would have smiled had she not been fairly certain she was about to throw up.</p><p>Oh, no no no, she thought again as she watched Peter march purposefully toward the closed door and the art wraiths waiting to pass judgment. On her.</p><p>Clara&#x2019;s hands grew cold and numb as she moved slowly forward, propelled by an undeniable force, a rude mix of excitement and terror. She wanted to rush toward the doors, yank them open and yell, &#x201c;Here I am!&#x201d;</p><p>But mostly she wanted to turn and flee, to hide.</p><p>To stumble back down the long, long, light-filled, art-filled, marble-filled hallway. To admit she&#x2019;d made a mistake. Given the wrong answer when asked if she&#x2019;d like a solo show. At the Mus�e. When asked if she&#x2019;d like all her dreams to come true.</p><p>She&#x2019;d given the wrong answer. She&#x2019;d said yes. And this is where it led.</p><p>Someone had lied. Or hadn&#x2019;t told the whole truth. In her dream, her only dream, played over and over since childhood, she had a solo show at the Mus�e d&#x2019;Art Contemporain. She walked down this corridor. Composed and collected. Beautiful and slim. Witty and popular.</p><p>Into the waiting arms of an adoring world.</p><p>There was no terror. No nausea. No creatures glimpsed through the frosted glass, waiting to devour her. Dissect her. Diminish her, and her creations.</p><p>Someone had lied. Had not told her something else might be waiting.</p><p>Failure.</p><p>Oh, no no no, thought Clara. Still the dead one lay moaning.</p><p>What was the rest of the poem? Why did it elude her?</p><p>Now, within feet of the end of her journey all she wanted to do was run away home to Three Pines. To open the wooden gate. To race up the path lined with apple trees in spring bloom. To slam their front door shut behind her. To lean against it. To lock it. To press her body against it, and keep the world out.</p><p>Now, too late, she knew who&#x2019;d lied to her.</p><p>She had.</p><p>Clara&#x2019;s heart threw itself against her ribs, like something caged and terrified and desperate to escape. She realized she was holding her breath and wondered for how long. To make up for it she started breathing rapidly.</p><p>Peter was talking but his voice was muffled, far away. Drowned out by the shrieking in her head, and the pounding in her chest.</p><p>And the noise building behind the doors. As they got closer.</p><p>&#x201c;This&#x2019;s going to be fun,&#x201d; said Peter, with a reassuring smile.</p><p>Clara opened her hand and dropped her purse. It fell with a plop to the floor, since it was all but empty, containing simply a breath mint and the tiny paint brush from the first paint-by-number set her grandmother had given her.</p><p>Clara dropped to her knees, pretending to gather up invisible items and stuff them into her clutch. She lowered her head, trying to catch her breath, and wondered if she was about to pass out.</p><p>&#x201c;Deep breath in,&#x201d; she heard. &#x201c;Deep breath out.&#x201d;</p><p>Clara stared from the purse on the gleaming marble floor to the man crouched across from her.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t Peter.</p><p>Instead, she saw her friend and neighbor from Three Pines, Olivier Brul�. He was kneeling beside her, watching, his kind eyes life preservers thrown to a drowning woman. She held them.</p><p>&#x201c;Deep breath in,&#x201d; he whispered. His voice was calm. This was their own private crisis. Their own private rescue.</p><p>She took a deep breath in.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can do it.&#x201d; Clara leaned forward, feeling faint. She could feel the walls closing in, and see Peter&#x2019;s polished black leather shoes on the floor ahead. Where he&#x2019;d finally stopped. Not missing her right away. Not noticing his wife was kneeling on the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; whispered Olivier. &#x201c;But I also know you. Whether it&#x2019;s on your knees or on your feet, you&#x2019;re going through that door.&#x201d; He nodded toward the end of the hall, his eyes never leaving hers. &#x201c;It might as well be on your feet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not too late.&#x201d; Clara searched his face. Seeing his silky blond hair, and the lines only visible very close up. More lines than a thirty-eight-year-old man should have. &#x201c;I could leave. Go back home.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivier&#x2019;s kindly face disappeared and she saw again her garden, as she&#x2019;d seen it that morning, the mist not yet burned off. The dew heavy under her rubber boots. The early roses and late peonies damp and fragrant. She&#x2019;d sat on the wooden bench in their backyard, with her morning coffee, and she&#x2019;d thought about the day ahead.</p><p>Not once had she imagined herself collapsed on the floor. In terror. Longing to leave. To go back to the garden.</p><p>But Olivier was right. She wouldn&#x2019;t return. Not yet.</p><p>Oh, no no no. She&#x2019;d have to go through those doors. They were the only way home now.</p><p>&#x201c;Deep breath out,&#x201d; Olivier whispered, with a smile.</p><p>Clara laughed, and exhaled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d make a good midwife.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you two doing down there?&#x201d; Gabri asked as he watched Clara and his partner. &#x201c;I know what Olivier usually does in that position and I hope that isn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d; He turned to Peter. &#x201c;Though that might explain the laughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; Olivier handed Clara her purse and they got to their feet.</p><p>Gabri, never far from Olivier&#x2019;s side, gave Clara a bear hug. &#x201c;You OK?&#x201d; He examined her closely. He was big, though Gabri preferred to call himself &#x201c;burly,&#x201d; his face unscored by the worry lines of his partner.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; said Clara.</p><p>&#x201c;Fucked up, insecure, neurotic and egotistical?&#x201d; asked Gabri.</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great. So&#x2019;m I. And so&#x2019;s everyone through there.&#x201d; Gabri gestured toward the door. &#x201c;What they aren&#x2019;t is the fabulous artist with the solo show. So you&#x2019;re both fine and famous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coming?&#x201d; asked Peter, waving toward Clara and smiling.</p><p>She hesitated, then taking Peter&#x2019;s hand, they walked together down the corridor, the sharp echoes of their feet not quite masking the merriment on the other side.</p><p>They&#x2019;re laughing, thought Clara. They&#x2019;re laughing at my art.</p><p>And in that instant the body of the poem surfaced. The rest of it was revealed.</p><p>Oh, no no no, thought Clara. Still the dead one lay moaning.</p><p>I was much too far out all my life</p><p>And not waving but drowning.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>From far off Armand Gamache could hear the sound of children playing.

After fifteen months of covering steroid use in sports, in December 2004 they reported in the <i>Chronicle</i> on the secret grand jury testimony of pro baseball players Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds, making headlines around the world. Fainaru- Wada and Williams won the Dick Schaap Excellence in Sports Journalism Award, the George Polk Award, and the White House Correspondents�&#x2019; Association�&#x2019;s Edgar A. Poe Award for their reporting.The abridged version of this book gets right to the point: Barry Bonds and other elite athletes used steroids because that was the only way they could succeed and used other substances to mask this use when they were tested. Some people might not find this surprising, but hearing the actual evidence is jarring to anyone who relishes true competition. Narrator Arnie Mazer's voice is nasally, reedy, combative, and somewhat annoying. In other words, he's the perfect person to read a sports book in which the athletes try to dupe unwitting fans. It's as if Mazer, speaking for the public, is outraged that our baseball, football, and Olympic heroes would sell their souls for one more victory.

David Reynolds writes superbly and his analysis is compelling and original." -Anne Chisolm, Chair of the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize Committee, and Chair of the Royal Society of Literature.</strong></p> One of the most violent conflicts in the history of civilization, World War I has been strangely forgotten in American culture. It has become a ghostly war fought in a haze of memory, often seen merely as a distant preamble to World War II. In <em>The Long Shadow</em> critically acclaimed historian David Reynolds seeks to broaden our vision by assessing the impact of the Great War across the twentieth century. He shows how events in that turbulent century&#x2015;particularly World War II, the Cold War, and the collapse of Communism&#x2015;shaped and reshaped attitudes to 1914&#x2013;18. <p>By exploring big themes such as democracy and empire, nationalism and capitalism, as well as art and poetry, <em>The Long Shadow</em> is stunningly broad in its historical perspective. Reynolds throws light on the vast expanse of the last century and explains why 1914&#x2013;18 is a conflict that America is still struggling to comprehend. Forging connections between people, places, and ideas, The Long Shadow ventures across the traditional subcultures of historical scholarship to offer a rich and layered examination not only of politics, diplomacy, and security but also of economics, art, and literature. The result is a magisterial reinterpretation of the place of the Great War in modern history.</p> 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>David Reynolds is a professor of international history at Cambridge University. He is the author of books including The Long Shadow and In Command of History: Churchill Fighting and Writing the Second World War, which won the Wolfson Prize.&#x201c;Brilliant...the most challenging and intelligent book on the Great War and our perceptions of it that any of us will read this, or any other year.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Charmley, <em>The Times (UK)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[World War I has] been analyzed before, but never with such depth of perception or range of understanding.

Recommended for most public-library health collections <i>Donna Seaman</i>The people depicted in the photographs used throughout this effective, easy-to-follow guide are neither super-skinny nor overly muscled; one has gray hair, one is pregnant, one's tummy bulges over his waistband. Clearly addressing ordinary folk, Christensen breaks down each of her 20-minute practices into two minutes of breathing, two minutes of slow warm-up and eight minutes each of exercise and meditation. All the routines provide full-body toning. Some are very gentle. Several are quite challenging. Christensen suggests that meditation enhances one's ability to be in the moment and to concentrate. Her well-designed approach, explained in lucid, focused prose, allows readers to refer easily to what they need. Readers seeking help with certain positions, those interested in the philosophical basis of yoga or those seeking friendly support and advice will find that information here. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trial by Fire: A People&#39;s History of the Civil War and Reconstruction</h2><p>The fifth volume of the noted historian&#39;s acclaimed history of the United States covers all main events and personalities of the Civil War and Reconstruction and describes the wartime lives of Americans, north and south</p><p></p><h2>The Aspern Papers and Other Stories (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>An American editor with an enthusiasm for the works of Jeffrey Aspern, a romantic poet of the early 19th century, goes to Venice to acquire the letters that Aspern wrote to his mistress, a Miss Bordereau, whom he called "Juliana."

Kingsbury reside en el estado de Washington con Don, su esposo, y sus seis hijos, tres de los cuales los adotatron en Haiti.Prolific evangelical Christian fiction author Kingsbury (<i>Between Sundays</i>) revisits characters from her previously well-received 9/11 series in this stand-alone focusing on sheriff's deputy Alex Brady, who lost his fireman father in the twin towers attack. Now 25 years old, Brady, whose faith once ran sure and strong, turned from God and family after his father's death. He relocates to California and spends all his time trying to find the bad guys and put them away with the aid of his K-9 partner, Bo. Bent on preventing arsonists from setting more fires, Brady is stunned to discover that others have endured similar loss but have made peace and moved on. Despite his anger, Brady's heart begins to thaw when unexpected memories and people re-enter his life, forcing him to choose between bitterness or hope. In typical Kingsbury style, by book's end the troubles are tidily wrapped up, which is clearly not so in real life. But the novelist's ability to accurately express life's sorrows and grief through her characters' inner dialogue rings true time and again. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There was no reply from the other residents at number 2, Buckingham Avenue. He paused on the half-landing, looking out of the little window. He saw the roof of his garage, and his neighbour's garden. "Well, who?" he muttered. There was nothing in view but a scudding 8:00 A.M. sky, a promise of weak sunshine, a vista of close, green, dripping trees. Midsummer. Colin went down, twitching his tie.</p><p>Behind him, the three younger children were preparing for their day. He heard shrieks and curses, the kicking and slamming of doors. The radio was on, and they were playing records too; Acid Raine and the Oncogenes were shaking the walls with their current hit single. "Ted Hughes?" Colin asked. "Larkin?"</p><p>There would be perhaps ten minutes' grace before the children erupted down the stairs to fall on their breakfasts and begin their daily round of feuding amongst themselves and insulting their parents. Colin examined himself in the mirror at the bottom of the stairs. He wished that Sylvia would move it, so that he did not have to begin every day with a confrontation. Perhaps he could ask her. He did not think of moving it himself. He had his spheres of action; this was not one of them.</p><p>He saw a man of forty-three, with bright blue eyes, thinning hair, and what he described to himself as faded good looks. But no, he thought; courtesans are faded, schoolmasters are merely worn. He saw a kind of helplessness, in the face of family and wider society; a lack of fibre, both moral and dietary. Listening to the racket above, he solaced himself with a quotation: "They fuck you up, your mum and dad / They may not mean to, but they do."</p><p>Sylvia was in the kitchen already. He thought he could hear her special muesli mix cascading like a rockfall into a dish. But instead he found her in the middle of the room, head tipped back, gazing upwards.</p><p>"What a mess," she said. The entire ceiling and the upper third of the walls were coated with the black smeary deposit from yesterday's fire. Lizzie, the daily, had opened the door from the hall, and there it was, stinking smoke billowing everywhere. Lucky she had presence of mind, or it would have been far more serious.</p><p>"I can't see why it's so greasy," Sylvia said. "It isn't as if we ever fry anything." She gave a little hitch to the pants of her tracksuit. "The whole room'll need repainting. Probably the hall as well."</p><p>"Yes, all right," Colin said, going to the table. He was sick of hearing about the fire. "Can I have an egg?"</p><p>"Well, be it on your own head," Sylvia said. "You've had two this week. You know what the doctor said."</p><p>"I think I'll be reckless for once." Colin opened the fridge. "Was young Alistair at home when this fire started?"</p><p>"If he was, he won't admit it."</p><p>"He's the source of most of the calamities round here, isn't he? And I can tell you now--" He broke off. "Where's a pan for this egg?"</p><p>"Where it always is, Colin."</p><p>"I can tell you now I'm not doing the repainting." He ran the tap. "Either Alistair does it--for a fee, if necessary--or we get somebody in."</p><p>Sylvia picked up an orange from a straw basket on the worktop. "I don't see why you can't do it." She tossed the orange into her left hand, and it slapped against her palm. "It's the end of term soon."</p><p>"True. I have one day's summer holiday and then I start on next year's timetable."</p><p>Sylvia's eyes followed him as he moved about the kitchen. "Are you having bread?" she asked, her tone incredulous.</p><p>Striding about in her bright blue tracksuit, Sylvia would never have been taken for a mother of four. Suzanne, the eldest, was eighteen now; her mother was waiting hopefully for the day when someone would mistake them for sisters. It was mysterious, this matter of Sylvia's age. At twenty, she had looked forty; all the girls on her street wanted to look like their mothers. The Youth Cult passed her by; at thirty she looked forty still, square and deep-bosomed, with her hair bleached and lacquered in the way she had worn it on the day she was married.</p><p>Then at some stage--Colin couldn't pinpoint it--she had stopped getting older. She took herself in hand. She bought a leotard, and went timidly to a class at the church hall; she stood watching, her hands splayed self-consciously to hide her pannier thighs. The next week she bought a tape of disco music, and started dancing. She clumped over the fitted carpets, making the glass shelves tinkle in the china cabinet that had been her mother's. She threw out the china cabinet, and got some pine shelves instead.</p><p>These days she wore her brown hair in a short curly perm, which her hairdresser, Shane, believed would soften her firm, rather harsh features. Her body was lean now, dieted and disciplined, capriciously nourished and not too much: as far as her brain was concerned, she was taking a course at the Open University. Now that she had lost so much weight, she was always in pursuit of new clothes, little tee shirts and cotton skirts which were bright, cheap, and casual; she picked up her ideas on the same plan. It seemed to Colin that she had chosen, among current fads and notions, all those designed to diminish his self-respect and make him most uncomfortable.</p><p>How nice it would be if she had a job, Colin thought. He was a Deputy Head; they scraped along. There were even luxuries, like Lizzie Blank the daily woman (Tuesdays and Thursdays). But the children ate so much, and left the lights on and the taps running; they needed outfits and treats, and dinner money and bus money and more money, they insisted, for day-glo paint and handcuffs and all the other stuff you wore to an Acid Raine concert. They wanted special diets and school trips, and a tent so they could sleep in the garden in summer; they wanted video nasties, and Claire--it was reassuring, he supposed--wanted a new Brownie uniform. Every whim cost cash down. For all he knew, they might be maintaining a heroin habit. It couldn't have cost more. When he opened his bank statements he felt as if he were being eaten away, month by month, from the inside out.</p><p>But unfortunately, there were no jobs; not for anybody really, and certainly not for Sylvia. She was not qualified for anything. She was educated now, but not trained. The old Sylvia showed through too often. She became emotional when their opinions differed. Under pressure, she was always regressing to the received wisdom of the cooked meats factory where she had worked before they were married.</p><p>Colin found a plate for his bread and took it to the table. "So..." he said. "What are you up to today?"</p><p>"Citizens Advice Bureau, ten till twelve." Sylvia peeled her orange. "Then later on there's this committee meeting. We're thinking about setting up a women's refuge."</p><p>There was something bubbling and thwarted in Sylvia that only meddling in other people's business would satisfy. Before the birth of their youngest child Claire, when they had lived on a large housing estate, there had been plenty of time for gossip; some of it idle, some of it manipulative. Buckingham Avenue had repressed her, with its absence of tittle-tattle, its well-kept fences, its elderly residents leading sedate and private lives. Good fences make good neighbours, he used to say, when they moved in, nine years ago. Sylvia didn't agree. In her fortieth year, Sylvia discovered social concern. She discovered community action, and protest, and steering committees. If Alistair's blossoming delinquencies didn't spoil her chances, she'd probably end up a JP. This was a big change; but it was not unaccountable. The children no longer needed her, and the marriage was not worthy of sustained attention. It just ran on, taking care of itself. After twenty years you can't expect passion. It's enough if you're barely civil.</p><p>Colin stood over the cooker and looked down at his egg, bobbing dizzily in a froth of leaking white. As if alive, it flew about and tapped itself against the side of the pan. He picked up a teaspoon and dabbed at it, scalding his fingers in the steam. He could feel Sylvia watching him. By her standards, he had no common sense: he had never laid claim to it. But he was a clever man, and capable in his own line. His face wore a habitual expression of strained tolerance, of goodwill and anxiety, uneasily mixed.</p><p>"We're still marking exams," he said. He dipped for his egg with a tea strainer, which he had found by chance in a drawer. "I've got three hundred reports to sign. And the union blokes are coming in to see me this morning. You'd think they'd let it rest till after the holidays. But no."</p><p>"Strike?"</p><p>"Well, they're talking about it."</p><p>"I've every sympathy."</p><p>"So have I, I want a pay rise too, but it makes it bloody difficult to run a school." He sighed, and went about with his egg.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Sylvia asked. "Why don't you put it in an egg cup and sit down with it? Or are you going to race off with it down Lauderdale Road?"</p><p>Colin sat down with his ovoid ruin and picked up the newspaper. The day had brightened and the pleasant morning sun shone through his double glazing. "I always think of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> when I eat an egg," he told his wife. "You see--" He broke off, gaped, put down his egg spoon, and seized up the newspaper. "Good God, Sylvia. York Minster's burned down. Look at this." He thrust the newspaper at her. The front page bore the headline NIGHT SKY LIT UP BY GOTHIC GLORY ABLAZE and a four-column picture of the Minster's south transept wreathed in smoke and flame.</p><p>"It never rains but it pours," Sylvia remarked, glancing at the kitchen ceiling. She tilted her yoghurt carton and scraped it out delicately with her teaspoon. "Funny, Lizzie was off to York yesterday on a day trip. I wonder if she saw it."</p><p>"It happened at half two in the morning."</p><p>"What a pity. She doesn't like to miss anything."</p><p>"Good God, it's not a tourist attraction," Colin said. "It's a national tragedy. Four million pounds' worth of damage." He groaned.</p><p>"Don't take it so personally."</p><p>"'The fire took almost three hours to contain,'" Colin read out loud. "'Although it was stopped from spreading to the central tower, or from seriously damaging the Minster's famous collection of stained-glass windows, it left the transept's ancient roof beams and plastered vaults a smouldering mass on the floor below.'"</p><p>"Your egg's going cold," Sylvia said. "I'd have thought you'd eat it, after you went to such trouble to get it."</p><p>"I've lost my appetite. You don't seem to appreciate what a loss this is to our heritage."</p><p>"It's no loss to your arteries, anyway." Sylvia tossed her yoghurt carton into the wastebin. She opened one of the kitchen cupboards and began to take down the packets of the stuff the children ate. Amid Colin's disinterested grief he felt a sharp prickle of personal resentment: she still does things for them, but nothing at all for me. "How did it start?" she enquired.</p><p>"Lightning, they think. They quote a priest here who says it was divine intervention."</p><p>"Why should it be that?"</p><p>"Because of the Bishop of Durham. He was consecrated at the Minster last Friday. You know, all about his controversial views on the Resurrection. I thought that now you're so friendly with our vicar you'd be well up in all this."</p><p>"Francis doesn't talk about the Church much, he talks about community projects." Sylvia rummaged in the cutlery drawer. "If God didn't like the Bishop of Durham, why didn't He strike him personally? And do it promptly, on Saturday morning?"</p><p>"Well, I tend to agree with you," Colin said. "It can't be that, can it?" He turned to the back page for more news of the disaster. "'The Lord was on our side as we battled the flames,'" he read. "By the way, how's the vicar's son? Has he come out of Youth Custody yet?"</p><p>"He's not in Youth Custody. He's having Intermediate Treatment. He's doing community service." Sylvia reached out for a piece of toast and picked up her knife. "Do you know what Francis says?"</p><p>"Watch it, that's butter you're eating," Colin said.</p><p>"Oh, so it is!" Looking thoughtful, she put the bread down on her plate. "He says that this business of Austin doing take-and-drive-away, it's a deep compulsion he has, a compulsion to find out his real identity by sampling and testing out various machines."</p><p>"You mean it's the vicar's fault for naming him after a car?"</p><p>"At some level, you see, Francis thinks he does believe that. By dumping the cars, he's trying to jettison the mechanistic fantasies that have taken him over, and affirm his survival as a human being. It's a form of acting out. Francis's real worry is that because he usually leaves the cars in such a wrecked-up condition, it may indicate suicidal tendencies."</p><p>"Lordy, lordy," Colin said. "I didn't know you could kill yourself by sniffing glue."</p><p>"It can damage your brain."</p><p>"How would they know?"</p><p>"Francis is very worried. He can't talk to Hermione. She thinks it's because they didn't send him to boarding school."</p><p>"I don't doubt he'll be boarded out soon enough, and at the taxpayers' expense. How he got off this time beats me."</p><p>"He didn't get off." Sylvia looked offended. "Community service is a very valid option."</p><p>"I'd rather he were in custody. Keep him away from our kids. How does a vicar's son turn out such a thug?"</p><p>There was no time to go into this, because the children rushed in: Karen and Claire in their school uniforms, and the boy in a kind of romper suit of sagging jersey fabric, with holes cut out of it here and there, exposing bits of flesh. The girls flung themselves into their chairs.</p><p>"Brownies tonight," Claire said: a chubby child, putting out her paws for everything edible within reach. "And I haven't got my new uniform yet, Mum."</p><p>"Okay, I'll see about it." She knew that the Brownies were a conformist outfit, pseudo-masculine if not paramilitary, but she suspected that they were more harmless than some of the things her children got up to.</p><p>"You ought to see her," Karen said. "She shouldn't grow so much, it's uncouth. Her skirt's up round her bum. It's child pornography."</p><p>"That will do," Colin said.</p><p>Claire stuffed a piece of toast into her mouth. "It's Brownie Tea-Making Fortnight soon. I have to make at least fifty cups of tea for family and friends. And every cup I make, they give it marks."</p><p>"If you make me any mouldy tea," Alistair said, "I'll pour it down the sink."</p><p>"I have these mark sheets," she went on. "You have to say what my tea is, Excellent, Very Good, or Good."</p><p>"What if it's witches' piss?"

Gu�ra for an intense crime drama that mixes organized crime with current Native American culture. This special low-priced volume collects the first five issues of the riveting Vertigo series SCALPED. Fifteen years ago, Dashiell "Dash" Bad Horse ran away from a life of abject poverty and utter hopelessness on the Prairie Rose Indian Reservation searching for something better. Now he's come back home armed with nothing but a set of nunchucs, a hell-bent-for-leather attitude and one dark secret, to find nothing much has changed on "The Rez" &#x2014; short of a glimmering new casino, and a once-proud people overcome by drugs and organized crime. Is he here to set things right or just get a piece of the action?</p><p><b>Jason Aaron</b> is an Eisner and Harvey Award-nominated comic book writer whose best known work includes the Native American crime series <i>Scalped</i> for Vertigo and stints on series such as&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>,&nbsp;<i>Ghost Rider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Punisher MAX</i>,&nbsp;<i>Wolverine</i>,&nbsp;<i>Incredible Hulk</i>, <i>Wolverine &amp; The X-Men</i>, <i>Thor,</i>&nbsp;and <i>Avengers vs. X-Men</i>, all for Marvel.

He has also illustrated stunning covers for DC Comics titles including <i>Batman, Nightwing, </i>and <i>Catwoman,</i> as well as interior art for <i>Swamp Thing</i> and <i>John Constantine, Hellblazer</i> from Vertigo.<i>Starred Review.</i> Aaron's reservation setting, described by a character in the first chapter as a third world nation in the heart of America, is perfect for a story of crime and family. Dash Bad Horse has come back to the reservation he ran away from at age 13. Now he enforces the law in a land where many have given up hope. Bad Horse is also an undercover FBI agent, put back in his home so federal authorities can take down crime boss and casino owner Lincoln Red Crow. Aaron masterfully depicts Bad Horse's tortured split psychology. The character is tough as nails and switches quickly between displaying likable and unlikable behavior. The family dynamics, which includes Bad Horse's activist mother and Red Crow's wild daughter, could come off as soap opera, but Aaron knows how to use personal relationships to explain character and setting. The world of the Prairie Rose Reservation is full of life thanks to the art of Guera, somewhat in the vein of Eduardo Risso's on <i>100 Bullets</i>. His characters contain a certain amount of grace no matter how ugly the situations get. The second story collected in the book is the flashback-heavy Hoka Hey, which shows that Aaron has a complex history planned for these characters. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"For six days he had offered many kilowatts of prayer, but the static kept him from being heard On High." The gods are a starship crew who subdued a colony world; developed godlike--though often machine-enhanced--powers during successive lifetimes of mind transfer to new, cloned bodies; and now lord it over descendants of the ship's mere passengers. Their tyranny is opposed by retired god Sam, who mocks the Celestial City, introduces Buddhism to subvert Hindu dogma, allies himself with the planet's native "demons" against Heaven, fights pyrotechnic battles with bizarre troops and weapons, plays dirty with politics and poison, and dies horribly but won't stay dead. It's a huge, lumbering, magical story, told largely in flashback, full of wonderfully ornate language (and one unforgivable pun) that builds up the luminous myth of trickster Sam, Lord of Light. Essential SF reading. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i><p>Earth is long since dead. On a colony planet, a band of men has gained control of technology, made themselves immortal, and now rules their world as the gods of the Hindu pantheon.

A single lawyer&#x2019;s lamp spread its yellow hue over the leather-topped desk. The room smelled of linseed oil and musty pages, but to Dr. John Francis it was the scent of knowledge.</p> <p>"Evil is beyond the reach of no man."</p> <p>"But can a man remove himself beyond the reach of evil?" Kevin asked.</p> <p>The dean of academic affairs, Dr. John Francis, gazed over bifocals at the man who sat opposite him and allowed a small smile to nudge his lips. Those blue eyes hid a deep mystery, one that had eluded him since their first meeting three months earlier when Kevin Parson approached him after a philosophy lecture. They&#x2019;d struck up a unique friendship that included numerous discussions such as this one. </p> <p>Kevin sat with his feet flat, hands on knees, eyes piercing and un-moving, hair ruffled despite a compulsive habit of running his fingers through his loose brown curls. Or because of it. The hair was an anomaly; in every other way the man groomed himself perfectly. Clean shaven, fashionably current, pleasantly scented&#x2013;Old Spice, if the professor guessed right. Kevin&#x2019;s ragged hair begged to differ in a bohemian sort of way. Others fiddled with pencils or twirled their fingers or shifted in their seats; Kevin ran his fingers through his hair and tapped his right foot. Not now and then or at appropriate breaks in the conversation, but regularly, to the beat of a hidden drum behind his blue eyes. Some might consider the idiosyncrasies annoying, but Dr. Francis saw them as nothing more than enigmatic clues to Kevin&#x2019;s nature. The truth&#x2013;rarely obvious and almost always found in subtle-ies. In the tapping of feet and the fiddling of fingers and the movement of eyes.</p> <p>Dr. Francis pushed his black leather chair back from the desk, stood slowly to his feet, and walked to a bookcase filled with the works of the ancient scholars. In many ways he identified with these men as much as he did with the modern man. Put a robe on him and he would look rather like a bearded Socrates, Kevin had once told him. He ran a finger over a bound copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p> <p>"Indeed," Dr. Francis said. "Can man step beyond evil&#x2019;s reach? I think not. Not in this lifetime."</p> <p>"Then all men are condemned to a life of evil," Kevin said.</p> <p>Dr. Francis faced him. Kevin watched, unmoving except for his right foot, tapping away. His round blue eyes held steady, stared with the innocence of a child&#x2019;s, probing, magnetic, unabashed. These eyes attracted long stares from the secure and forced the less secure to avert their gaze. Kevin was twenty-eight, but he possessed a strange blend of brilliance and naivet� that Dr. Francis could not understand. The full-grown man thirsted for knowledge like a five-year-old. Something to do with a unique rearing in a bizarre home, but Kevin had never been forthcoming.</p> <p>"A lifetime struggle with evil, not a life of evil," Dr. Francis clarified. </p> <p>"And does man simply choose evil, or does he create it?" Kevin asked, already many thoughts beyond his initial question. "Is evil a force that swims in human blood, struggling to find its way into the heart, or is it an external possibility wanting to be formed?" </p> <p>"I would say man chooses evil rather than creates it. Human nature&#x2019;s saturated with evil as a result of the Fall. We are all evil."</p> <p>"And we are all good," Kevin said, tapping his foot. "The good, the bad, and the beautiful." </p> <p>Dr. Francis nodded at the use of the phrase he&#x2019;d coined, which referred to the man created in God&#x2019;s nature, the beautiful man, struggling between the good and the bad. "The good, the bad, and the beautiful. Indeed." He stepped for the door. "Walk with me, Kevin."</p> <p>Kevin ran both hands past his temples and stood. Dr. Francis led him from the office and up a flight of steps to the world above, as Kevin liked to call it.</p> <p>"How is your paper on the natures progressing?" Dr. Francis asked.</p> <p>"Guaranteed to raise your eyebrows." They stepped into the empty main hall. "I&#x2019;m using a story to illustrate my conclusion. Not conventional, I know, but since Christ preferred to use fiction to communicate truth, I figured you wouldn&#x2019;t mind if I borrowed from him."</p> <p>"As long as it makes the point. I look forward to reading it."</p> <p>III</p> <p>Kevin walked with Dr. John Francis down the hall, thinking that he liked this man beside him. The sound of their shoes striking the hardwood floor echoed through the chamber steeped in tradition. The older man strolled casually, his ready smile hinting at wisdom far beyond his words. Kevin glanced up at the paintings of the divinity school&#x2019;s founders along the wall to his right. Bold, gentle giants, Dr. Francis called them.</p> <p>"Speaking of evil, all men are capable of gossip, don&#x2019;t you think?" Kevin asked.</p> <p>"Undoubtedly."</p> <p>"Even the bishop is capable of gossip."</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"Do you think the bishop does gossip? Sometimes?"</p> <p>The dean&#x2019;s answer waited three steps. "We are all human."</p> <p>They came to the large door that opened to the central campus and Dr. Francis pushed it open. Despite the ocean breezes, Long Beach could not escape periodic stretches of oppressive heat. Kevin stepped out into the bright midday sunlight, and for a moment their philosophical bantering felt trivial in light of the world before him. A dozen seminary students walked across the manicured park, heads bent in thought or tilted back with smiles. Two dozen poplars formed an avenue through the expansive lawn. The chapel&#x2019;s steeple towered over the trees beyond the park. To his right, the Augustine Memorial Library glistened in the sun. The Divinity School of the Pacific, South, was at a glance statelier and more modern than its parent, the Episcopal seminary in Berkeley.</p> <p>Here was the real world, made up of normal people with sensible histories and ordinary families pursuing an admirable profession. He, on the other hand, was a twenty-eight-year-old convert who really had no business attending seminary at all, much less leading a flock one day. Not because he didn&#x2019;t have honorable intent, but because of who he was. Because he was Kevin Parson, who had really only discovered his spiritual side for the first time three years ago. In spite of his wholehearted embrace of the church, he still felt no holier&#x2013;and maybe less&#x2013;than any drunk on the street might. Not even the dean knew his whole story, and Kevin wasn&#x2019;t sure the man would be so supportive if he did. </p> <p>"You have a brilliant mind, Kevin," the dean said, gazing out at the grounds. "I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of people come and go, and few of them have your same tenacity for the truth. But believe me, the deepest questions can drive a man mad. The problem of evil is one of those questions. You&#x2019;d be wise to court it slowly." </p> <p>Kevin looked into the graying man&#x2019;s eyes, and for a moment neither spoke. The dean winked and Kevin offered a slight smile. Kevin liked this man as much as he might like a father.</p> <p>"You&#x2019;re a wise man, Dr. Francis. Thanks. I&#x2019;ll see you in class next week." </p> <p>"Don&#x2019;t forget your paper."</p> <p>"Never."</p> <p>The dean dipped his head.</p> <p>Kevin took one step down to the concrete landing and turned back. "Just one last thought. In absolute terms, gossip isn&#x2019;t so different from murder, right?"</p> <p>"Ultimately, no."</p> <p>"Then the bishop is ultimately capable of murder, isn&#x2019;t he?"</p> <p>The dean lifted his right eyebrow. "That&#x2019;s a bit of a stretch."</p> <p>Kevin smiled. "Not really. Neither is more evil."</p> <p>"You&#x2019;ve made your point, Kevin. I&#x2019;ll be sure to warn the bishop against any sudden urges to kill his fellowman."</p> <p>Kevin chuckled. He turned and walked down the steps. Behind him the door closed with a soft thump. He turned back. The steps were empty.</p> <p>He was alone. A stranger in a strange world. How many grown men would stare at a flight of steps just vacated by a professor of philosophy and feel utterly alone? He scratched his head and ruffled his hair.</p> <p>Kevin headed for the parking lot. The sense of solitude left him before he reached his car, which was good. He was changing, wasn&#x2019;t he? The hope of change was why he&#x2019;d chosen to become a priest in the first place. He&#x2019;d escaped the demons of his past and begun a new life as a new creature. He had put his old self in the grave and, despite the lingering memories, he was coming to life, like an aspen in the spring. </p> <p>So much change in so little time. God willing, the past would remain buried.</p> <p>He swung his beige Sable out of the lot and merged with the steady flow of traffic on Long Beach Boulevard. Evil. The problem of evil. Like traffic&#x2013;never ending. </p> <p>On the other hand, grace and love weren&#x2019;t exactly running scared, were they? He had more to be thankful for than he ever imagined possible. Grace, for starters. A fine school with fine teachers. His own home. He might not have a rack of friends to call on at his every whim, but he did have a few. One at least. Dr. John Francis liked him. </p> <p>He humphed. Okay, so he had a ways to go on the social front. Samantha had called him, though. They&#x2019;d talked twice in the last two weeks. And Sam was no slouch. Now there was a friend. Maybe more than a&#x2013;</p> <p>His cell phone chirped loudly from the cup holder. He&#x2019;d gotten the thing a week ago and had used it once, placed a call to his home phone to see if it worked. It had, but only after he&#x2019;d activated the voice mail, which had required a call to the salesman.</p> <p>The cell rang again and he picked it up. The thing was small enough to swallow if you got hungry enough. He pushed the red button and immediately knew it was the wrong one. Ignore "Send" above the green button. Green is go and red is stop, the salesman had said. </p> <p>Kevin lifted the phone to his ear, heard silence, and tossed it on the passenger seat, feeling foolish. It was probably the salesman, calling to see if he was enjoying his new phone. Then again, why would a salesman bother to check on a nineteen-dollar purchase?</p> <p>The phone chirped again. Behind him, a horn honked. A blue Mercedes crowded his bumper. Kevin punched the accelerator and picked up the phone. Red brake lights cut across all three lanes ahead. He slowed down&#x2013;the Mercedes would have to chill. He pressed the green button.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hello, Kevin."</p> <p>Male voice. Low and breathy. Drawn out to accentuate each syllable. </p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"How are you doing, my old friend? Quite well from what I can gather. How nice."</p> <p>The world around Kevin faded. He brought the car to a halt behind the sea of red taillights, felt the pressure of the brakes as a distant abstraction. His mind focused on this voice on the phone. </p> <p>"I . . . I&#x2019;m sorry. I don&#x2019;t think&#x2013;"</p> <p>"It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you know me." Pause. "I know you. In fact, if you really think you&#x2019;re cut out for this seminary foolishness, I must say I know you better than you know yourself."</p> <p>"I don&#x2019;t know who you think you are, but I don&#x2019;t have a clue what you&#x2019;re talking&#x2013;"</p> <p>"Don&#x2019;t be stupid!" the voice yelled into his ear. The man took a deep, scratchy breath. He spoke calmly again. "Forgive me, I really don&#x2019;t mean to yell, but you&#x2019;re not listening to me. It&#x2019;s time to quit pretending, Kevin. You think you have the whole world fooled, but you don&#x2019;t have me fooled. It&#x2019;s time to let the cat out of the bag. And I&#x2019;m going to help you do it."</p> <p>Kevin could hardly comprehend what he was hearing. Was this for real? It had to be a practical joke. Peter? Did Peter from Intro to Psych know him well enough to pull a stunt like this? </p> <p>"Who . . . who is this?"</p> <p>"You like games, don&#x2019;t you, Kevin?"</p> <p>There was no way Peter could sound so condescending. </p> <p>"Okay," Kevin said. "Enough. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2013;" </p> <p>"Enough? Enough? No, I don&#x2019;t think so. The game is just starting. Only this one is not like the games you play with everyone else, Kevin. This one&#x2019;s for real. Will the real Kevin Parson please stand up? I thought about killing you, but I&#x2019;ve decided this will be much better." The man paused, made a soft sound that sounded like a moan. "This . . . this will destroy you."</p> <p>Kevin stared ahead, dumbfounded. </p> <p>"You may call me Richard Slater. Ring any bells? Actually, I prefer Slater. And here&#x2019;s the game Slater would like to play. I will give you exactly three minutes to call the newspaper and confess your sin, or I will blow that silly Sable you call a car sky-high."</p> <p>"Sin? What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"That&#x2019;s the question, isn&#x2019;t it? I knew you&#x2019;d forget, you stupid brick." Another pause. "Do you like riddles? Here&#x2019;s a riddle to jog your mind: What falls but never breaks? What breaks but never falls?"</p> <p>"What? What&#x2019;s&#x2013;"</p> <p>"Three minutes, Kevin. Starting . . . now. Let the games begin."</p> <p>The phone went dead.</p> <p>For a moment, Kevin stared ahead, phone still plastered to his ear.</p> <p>A horn blared.</p> <p>The cars ahead were moving. The Mercedes was impatient again. Kevin pressed the accelerator, and the Sable surged forward. He set the phone down on the passenger seat and swallowed, throat dry. He glanced at the clock. 12:03. </p> <p>Okay, process. Stay calm and process. Did this really just happen? Of course it just happened! Some madman who called himself Slater just called my cell phone and threatened to blow up my car. Kevin grabbed the cell phone and stared at its face: "Unavailable, 00:39."</p> <p>But was the threat real? Who would really blow up a car in the middle of a busy street over a riddle? Someone was trying to scare the snot out of him for some maniacal reason. Or some sicko had randomly chosen him as his next victim, someone who hated seminary students instead of prostitutes and really intended to kill him. </p> <p>His thoughts spun crazily. What sin? He had committed his sins, of course, but none that stood out immediately. What falls but never breaks? What breaks but never falls?</p> <p>His pulse pounded in his ears. Maybe he should get off the road. Of course he should get off the road! If there was even a remote chance that Slater meant to carry out his threat . . . </p> <p>For the first time, Kevin imagined the car actually filling with a blast of fire. A shaft of panic ripped down his spine. He had to get out! He had to call the police! </p> <p>Not now. Now he had to get out. Out!</p> <p>Kevin jerked his foot off the accelerator and slammed it down on the brake. The Sable&#x2019;s tires squealed. A horn shrieked.

Here in full color are exquisite engravings, gold, silver and platinum inlays, intricately carved mother-of-pearl and ivory--craftsmanship which rivals any other field of decorative arts.</p><p>Engravers and embellishers of arms are the stars of this loving tribute to the artistry of firearms.For the gun enthusiast, nothing quite catches the eye like an exquisitely engraved and inlaid pistol or long-arm. Wilson, the author of nearly two dozen firearms-related titles, here offers a detailed chronicle of the true art of gun engraving in the United States. Wilson's history actually predates Colonial times, beginning with early English and European attempts at engraving with wheel-locks and flintlocks as far back as the 1500s. Most of the book, however, covers American arms with an emphasis on Colt single-action handguns, Winchester repeating rifles, and monstrous Sharps buffalo guns, with a few knives and swords added for ballast. The text is well detailed and readable, but the main feast here is the hundreds of glorious color photographs. Though the book is expensive, libraries with large hunting/shooting collections won't want to miss this sumptuous volume. Art collections may also wish to consider.

Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping, and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs...&#39; As the interminable case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce grinds its way through the Court of Chancery, it draws together a disparate group of people: Ada and Richard Clare, whose inheritance is gradually being devoured by legal costs; Esther Summerson, a ward of court, whose parentage is a source of deepening mystery; the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn; the determined sleuth Inspector Bucket; and even Jo, the destitute little crossing-sweeper. A savage, but often comic, indictment of a society that is rotten to the core, Bleak House is one of Dickens&#39;s most ambitious novels, with a range that extends from the drawing rooms of the aristocracy to the poorest of London slums. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p><i>Bleak House</i> is a satirical look at the Byzantine legal system in London as it consumes the minds and talents of the greedy and nearly destroys the lives of innocents--a contemporary tale indeed. Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket.

The only unusual thing about him was that Sandy had been raised by aliens on their spaceship. The Hakh&#39;hli had done everything they could to give Sandy an Earth-type boyhood. Now, finally, the Hakh&#39;hli were bringing Sandy home to Earth. And while they were at it, they intended to give humanity some extraordinary gifts. The Hakh&#39;hli seemed to have Sandy&#39;s -- and humanity&#39;s -- best interests at heart. But the people of Earth weren&#39;t so sure . . .An alien spaceship lands on Earth for a double purpose: to give the people of Earth the benefit of their advanced technology and to return to them a human rescued in infancy and raised by the kangaroo-like Hakh'hli to be as "human" as possible--under the circumstances.

Pham dreamed of becoming a writer. Born in Vietnam and raised in California, he held technical jobs at United Airlines-and always carried a letter of resignation in his briefcase. His father had been a POW of the Vietcong; his family came to America as "boat people." His sister committed suicide, prompting Andrew to quit his job. He sold all of his possessions and embarked on a year-long bicycle journey that took him through the Mexican desert, where he was treated as a bueno hermano, a "good brother"; around a thousand-mile loop from Narita to Kyoto in Japan; and, after five months and 2,357 miles, to Saigon, where he finds "nothing familiar in the bombed-out darkness." In Mexico he's treated kindly as a Vietnamito, though he shouts, "I'm American, Vietnamese American!" In Vietnam, he's taken for Japanese or Korean by his countrymen, except, of course, by his relatives, who doubt that as a Vietnamese he has the stamina to complete his journey ("Only Westerners can do it"); and in the United States he's considered anything but American. A vibrant, picaresque memoir written with narrative flair and a wonderful, eye-opening sense of adventure, <i>Catfish and Mandala </i>is an unforgettable search for cultural identity.<br></p><p>A great memoirist can burnish even an ordinary childhood into something bright--see, for instance, Annie Dillard's <i>An American Childhood</i>. So what about a really good writer with access to a dramatic and little-documented story? This is the case with <i>Catfish and Mandala</i>, Vietnamese American Andrew X. Pham's captivating first book, which delves fearlessly into questions of home, family, and identity. The son of Vietnamese parents who suffered terribly during the Vietnam War and brought their family to America when he was 10, Pham, on the cusp of his 30s, defied his parents' conservative hopes for him and his engineering career by becoming a poorly paid freelance writer. After the suicide of his sister, he set off on an even riskier path to travel some of the world on his bicycle. In the grueling, enlightening year that followed, he pedaled through Mexico, the American West Coast, Japan, and finally his far-off first land, Vietnam.<p> The story, with some of a mandala's repeated symbolic motifs, works on several levels at once. It is an exploration into the meaning of home, a descriptive travelogue, and an intimate look at the Vietnamese immigrant experience. There are beautifully illuminated flashbacks to the experience of fleeing Vietnam and to an earlier, more innocent childhood. While Pham's stern father, a survivor of Vietcong death camps, regrets that Pham has not been a respectful Vietnamese son, he also reveals that he wishes he himself had been more "American" for his kids, that he had "taken [them] camping." <i>Catfish and Mandala</i> is a book of double-edged truths, and it would make a fascinating study even in less able hands. In those of the adventurous, unsentimental Pham, it is an irresistible story. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p><i>Andrew X. Pham</i> was born in Vietnam in 1967 and moved to California with his family after the war. He lives in San Jose, California. This is his first book.<br></p><h2>How the Irish Won the American Revolution: A New Look at the Forgotten Heroes of America&#39;s War of Independence</h2><p>When the Continental Congress decided to declare independence from the British empire in 1776, ten percent of the population of their fledgling country were from Ireland. By 1790, close to 500,000 Irish citizens had immigrated to America. They were was very active in the American Revolution, both on the battlefields and off, and yet their stories are not well known. The important contributions of the Irish on military, political, and economic levels have been long overlooked and ignored by generations of historians. However, new evidence has revealed that Washington&#x2019;s Continental Army consisted of a far larger percentage of Irish soldiers than previously thought between 40 and 50 percent who fought during some of the most important battles of the American Revolution.<br><br>Romanticized versions of this historical period tend to focus on the upper class figures that had the biggest roles in America&#x2019;s struggle for liberty. But these adaptations neglect the impact of European and Irish ideals as well as citizens on the formation of the revolution. Irish contributors such as John Barry, the colonies&#x2019; foremost naval officer; Henry Knox, an artillery officer and future Secretary of War; Richard Montgomery, America&#x2019;s first war hero and martyr; and Charles Thomson, a radical organizer and Secretary to the Continental Congress were all instrumental in carrying out the vision for a free country. Without their timely and disproportionate assistance, America almost certainly would have lost the desperate fight for its existence.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

All of these skills--plus a strong sense of survival--are needed in this story about what happens when Dutch traders arrive in Nagasaki in 1690.

The sexually liberated, politically knowledgeable Stanley chose Montagu; Levine cites their 1915 marriage as a key factor in lovelorn Asquith's decision to form a wartime coalition government with members of the Tory party rather than pursue a parliamentary struggle. In the years following the wedding, Asquith is portrayed as an anti-Semite, Montagu as so assimilated he almost singlehandedly blunted the effectiveness of the 1917 Balfour Declaration pledging British support for a Jewish state in Palestine, and Stanley as an indifferent wife who had an open liaison with Lord Beaverbrook and a daughter by yet another man. Levine, senior vice-president of New York University, has written an engrossing history that intertwines political chicanery, romantic fireworks and an expose of British anti-Semitism.

Installed by her seafaring father in a big yellow house in Yorkshire under the care of two pious aunts, she spends her life in and near that spot. Once she loved a young poet who died in the Great War; later there was a German-Jewish refugee who placed his daughters in Polly's care before he died. Events occur undramatically, related with equal weight no matter what their relative significance.

Much of what the Hewitts have come to understand and embrace about their lives of deep nourishment is informed by their particular piece of land and local community in northern Vermont, but what they have gleaned is readily transferable to any place&#x2015;whether you live on 4 acres, 40 acres, or in a 400-square-foot studio apartment.</p> <p>Ben and Penny (and their two sons) maintain copious gardens, dozens of fruit and nut trees and other perennial plantings, as well as a pick-your-own blueberry patch. In addition to these cultivated food crops, they also forage for wild edibles, process their own meat, make their own butter, and ferment, dry, and can their own vegetables. Their focus is to produce nutrient-dense foods from vibrant, mineralized soils for themselves and their immediate community. They are also committed to sharing the traditional skills that support their family, helping them be self-sufficient and thrive in these uncertain times.</p> <p>Much of what the Hewitts are attempting on their homestead is to close the gaps that economic separation has created in our health, spirit, and skills. Ben uses the term &#x201c;practiculture&#x201d; to describe his family&#x2019;s work with the land&#x2015;a term that encompasses the many practical life skills and philosophies they embody to create a thriving homestead, including raw-milk production, soil remediation, wildcrafting, Weston A. Price principles, bionutrient-dense farming, permaculture, agroforestry, traditional Vermont hill farming, and more. <em>The Nourishing Homestead</em> also includes information on deep nutrition, the importance of good fats, and integrating children into the work of a homestead.</p> <p>The Hewitts&#x2019; story is reminiscent of <em>The Good Life</em>, by Helen and Scott Nearing, and is sure to inspire a new generation of homesteaders, or anyone seeking a simpler way of life and a deeper connection to the world.</p></p><p><p>Ben Hewitt lives in Cabot, Vermont with his wife, Penny, and sons Fin and Rye. Over the past 17 years, the Hewitt family has transformed an over-grazed pasture and neglected woodlot into a thriving homestead, producing an abundance of nutrient dense food in biologically active soils.</p> <p>Utilizing a combination of permaculture design, wildcrafting, and small-scale regenerative agriculture they call &#x201c;practiculture,&#x201d; the Hewitt family raises and forages better than 90% of their calories, with a focus on pastured meats, healthy fats, and fermented vegetables. They also produce all of their lumber and firewood, and practice traditional land skills such as hide tanning and basket making.</p> <p>The Hewitts consult frequently on homestead-scale production and processing of nutrient dense foods, as well as homestead planning, design, and implementation. They also run Lazy Mill Living Arts (www.lazymilllivingarts.com), which offers workshops in a wide variety of traditional land skills.</p> <p>Ben is the author of four other books, including&nbsp;<em>The Town That Food Saved&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Home Grown</em>. He blogs at&nbsp;www.benhewitt.net.</p><p><strong><em>Library Journal</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Ben and Penny Hewitt have resided on a 40-acre farm in Cabot, VT, for more than 15 years and are motivated by a desire to live their lives aligned with nature and provide most of their own food, creating from the ground up a sustainable and traditional homestead. The Hewitts chronicle the development of their sanctuary in this informative title, from the initial design of their hand-built house and revitalizing the soil for crops to foraging for wild edibles, processing their own meat, and preserving produce. The belief in nourishment in all aspects&#x2014;Ben calls it 'practiculture'&#x2014;of their lives, including dealing with modern-day&nbsp;&#x2018;stuff' and raising children (two sons), creates a running thread throughout the book.

Unlike the Nearings, the Hewitts benefit from 21st-century developments like permaculture, rotational grazing, and nutrient-dense farming, and they incorporate livestock as an essential and beloved element of their farmstead&#x2015;almost a third of the book is devoted to animal husbandry. Best of all, adorable photos of the Hewitts&#x2019; two young sons lounging on cows, curing hides, and harvesting garlic leaven the earnest prose.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>"If&nbsp;<em>Walden</em>&nbsp;were a how-to book and updated for the twenty first century,&nbsp;<em>The Nourishing Homestead</em>&nbsp;would be it.&nbsp;Whether you have land or not, are a hardcore homesteader or a suburban gardener, you&#x2019;ll find this book packed with countless how-to gems for personal and family liberty. The practical usefulness of this book is hard to overstate; the Hewitts have written a manual girded by direct experience alone, not ideology--a true rarity."<strong>--Ben Falk, author of&nbsp;<em>The Resilient Farm and Homestead</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"A wise, poetic, and eminently practical manifesto,&nbsp;<em>The Nourishing Homestead</em>&nbsp;provides all the ingredients for a nutrient-dense life.

In 1881, more by accident than design, as Churchill sees it, England was drawn into the affairs of Egypt. Once there, under Lord Cromer and with virtually sovereign power, the English strove to establish a sound government and to stimulate Egyptian prosperity. It was at this moment, however, that the Mahdi rebelled and plunged the Egyptian suzerainty of Sudan into the bloodshed and confusion. Placing the catastrophic events of the 1880s in the context of Sudanese history, Churchill shows how the ineffectually maintained suzerainty gave rise to the Mahdi, who, in his view, fathered Arab nationalism. After tracing the Mahdi massacre of General Charles Gordon in Khartoum and the emergence of the fanatical, plunderous, and slave-raiding regime known as the Dervish Empire, Churchill dramatically recounts the reconquest and pacification of Sudan by a mixed Anglo-Egyptian force under the command of Sir Herbert Kitchener. The outcome would for decades link the destiny of Great Britain to Egypt in Sudan.</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesOne of the most famous political figures of the twentieth century, Sir Winston S.

All of the essays have been revised for this anthology. Basso, a major authority in the field of linguistic anthropology, has drawn on fieldwork at the village of Cibecue, whose residents speak a dialect of Western Apache that is spoken nowhere else. He shows how intricacies of language&#x2014;place names, metaphor, uses of silence&#x2014;help a people define their very existence, so that, in the words of one Apache woman, "If we lose our language, we will lose our breath; then we will die and blow away like leaves." His essays amply demonstrate that, while Apache language and culture are changing in response to modernization, they remain intricate, vital and unique. These essays illustrate not only the complexity of a particular cultural world as it has emerged to one observer over a protracted period of intensive fieldwork, but also the natural movement from the study of grammatical categories to that of language use and on to the study of the conceptual system underlying it. Each essay addresses a significant theoretical problem; taken together they constitute a microcosm of the anthropological understanding of language.<br><br> CONTENTS<br> The Western Apache Classificatory Verb System: A Semantic Analysis<br> Semantic Aspects of Linguistic Acculturation<br> A Western Apache Writing System: The Symbols of Silas John<br> "Wise Words" of the Western Apache: Metaphor and Semantic Theory<br> "To Give Up on Words": Silence in Western Apache Culture<br> "Stalking With Stories": Names, Places, and Moral Narratives among the Western Apache<br> "Speaking with Names": Language and Landscapes among the Western Apache</p><p>In these seven essays, Keith Basso defines some of the central concerns of linguistic anthropology through the close study of Western Apache, showing how intricacies of language-place names, metaphor, uses of silence-help a people define their very existence.Keith Basso is University Regents Professor of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico</p><h2>Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India</h2><p>From the author of <i>The Last Mughal</i> (&#x201c;A compulsively readable masterpiece&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Review of Books</i>), an exquisite, mesmerizing book that illuminates the remarkable ways in which traditional forms of religious life in India have been transformed in the vortex of the region&#x2019;s rapid change&#x2014;a book that distills the author&#x2019;s twenty-five years of travel in India, taking us deep into ways of life that we might otherwise never have known exist.<br><br>A Buddhist monk takes up arms to resist the Chinese invasion of Tibet&#x2014;and spends the rest of his life atoning for the violence by hand printing the finest prayer flags in India . . .

It is dawn. Below lies the ancient pilgrimage town of Sravanabelagola, where the crumbling walls of monasteries, temples and <i>dharamsalas</i> cluster around a grid of dusty, red earth roads. The roads converge on a great rectangular tank. The tank is dotted with the spreading leaves and still-closed buds of floating lotus flowers. Already, despite the early hour, the first pilgrims are gathering.<br><br>For more than 2,000 years, this Karnatakan town has been sacred to the Jains. It was here, in the third century bc, that the first Emperor of India, Chandragupta Maurya, embraced the Jain religion and died through a self-imposed fast to the death, the emperor&#x2019;s chosen atonement for the killings for which he had been responsible in his life of conquest. Twelve hundred years later, in ad 981, a Jain general commissioned the largest monolithic statue in India, sixty feet high, on the top of the larger of the two hills, Vindhyagiri.<br><br>This was an image of another royal Jain hero, Prince Bahubali. The prince had fought a duel with his brother Bharata for control of his father&#x2019;s kingdom. But in the very hour of his victory, Bahubali realised the folly of greed and the transience of worldly glory. He renounced his kingdom and embraced instead the path of the ascetic. Retreating to the jungle, he stood in meditation for a year, so that the vines of the forest curled around his legs and tied him to the spot. In this state he conquered what he believed to be the real enemies&#x2014;his passions, ambitions, pride and desires&#x2014;and so became, according to the Jains, the first human being to achieve <i>moksha</i>, or spiritual liberation.<br><br>The sun has only just risen above the palm trees, and an early morning haze still cloaks the ground. Yet already the line of pilgrims&#x2014;from a distance, tiny ant-like creatures against the dawn-glistening fused-mercury of the rock face&#x2014;are climbing the steps that lead up to the monumental hilltop figure of the stone prince. For the past thousand years this massive broad-shouldered statue, enclosed in its lattice of stone vines, has been the focus of pilgrimage in this Vatican of the Digambara, or Sky Clad Jains.<br><br>Digambara monks are probably the most severe of all India&#x2019;s ascetics. They show their total renunciation of the world by travelling through it completely naked, as light as the air, as they conceive it, and as clear as the Indian sky. Sure enough, among the many ordinary lay people in lungis and saris slowly mounting the rock-cut steps are several completely naked men&#x2014;Digambara monks on their way to do homage to Bahubali. There are also a number of white-clad Digambara nuns, or <i>matajis</i>, and it was in a temple just short of the summit that I first laid eyes on Prasannamati Mataji.<br><br>I had seen the tiny, slender, barefoot figure of the nun in her white sari bounding up the steps above me as I began my ascent. She climbed quickly, with a pot of water made from a coconut shell in one hand, and a peacock fan in the other. As she climbed, she gently wiped each step with the fan in order to make sure she didn&#x2019;t stand on, hurt or kill a single living creature on her ascent of the hill: one of the set rules of pilgrimage for a Jain <i>muni</i>, or ascetic.<br><br>It was only when I got to the Vadegall Basadi, the temple which lies just below the summit, that I caught up with her&#x2014;and saw that despite her bald head Mataji was in fact a surprisingly young and striking woman. She had large, wide-apart eyes, olive skin and an air of self-contained confidence that expressed itself in a vigour and ease in the way she held her body. But there was also something sad and wistful about her expression as she went about her devotions; and this, combined with her unexpected youth and beauty, left one wanting to know more.<br><br>Mataji was busy with her prayers when I first entered the temple. After the glimmering half-light outside, the interior was almost completely black, and it took several minutes for my eyes fully to adjust to the gloom. At the cardinal points within the temple, at first almost invisible, were three smooth, black marble images of the Jain <i>Tirthankaras</i>, or Liberators. Each was sculpted sitting Buddha-like in the <i>virasana samadhi</i>, with shaved head and elongated earlobes. The hands of each <i>Tirthankara </i>was cupped, and they sat cross-legged in a lotus position, impassive and focused inwards, locked in the deepest introspection and meditation. <i>Tirthankara</i> means literally &#x201c;ford-maker,&#x201d; and the Jains believe these heroic ascetic figures have shown the way to Nirvana, making a spiritual ford through the rivers of suffering, and across the wild oceans of existence and rebirth, so as to create a crossing place between <i>samsara </i>and liberation.<br><br>To each of these figures in turn, Mataji bowed. She then took some water from the attendant priest and poured it over the hands of the statues. This water she collected in a pot, and then used it to anoint the top of her own head. According to Jain belief, it is good and meritorious for pilgrims to express their devotion to the <i>Tirthankaras</i>, but they can expect no earthly rewards for such prayers: as perfected beings, the ford-makers have liberated themselves from the world of men, and so are not present in the statues in the way that, say, Hindus believe their deities are incarnate in temple images. The pilgrim can venerate, praise, adore and learn from the example of the <i>Tirthankaras</i>, and they can use them as a focus for their meditations. But as the ford-makers are removed from the world they are unable to answer prayers; the relationship between the devotee and the object of his devotion is entirely one way. At its purest, Jainism is almost an atheistic religion, and the much venerated images of the <i>Tirthankaras</i> in temples represent not so much a divine presence as a profound divine absence.<br><br>I was intrigued by Mataji&#x2019;s intense dedication to the images, but as she was deep in her prayers, it was clear that now was not the moment to interrupt her, still less to try to talk to her. From the temple, she headed up the hill to wash the feet of Bahubali. There she silently mouthed her morning prayers at the feet of the statue, her rosary circling in her hand. Then she made five rounds of the <i>parikrama </i>pilgrim circuit around the sanctuary, and as quickly as she had leapt up the steps, she headed down them again, peacock fan flicking and sweeping each step before her.<br><br>It was only the following day that I applied for, and was given, a formal audience&#x2014;or as the monks called it, <i>darshan</i>&#x2014;with Mataji at the monastery guest house; and it was only the day after that, as we continued our conversations, that I began to learn what had brought about her air of unmistakable melancholy.<br><br>&#x201c;We believe that all attachments bring suffering,&#x201d; said Prasannamati Mataji, after we had been talking for some time. &#x201c;This is why we are supposed to give them up. It is one of the main principles of Jainism&#x2014;we call it <i>aparigraha</i>. This was why I left my family, and why I gave away my wealth.&#x201d;<br><br>We were talking in the annex of a monastery prayer hall, and Mataji was sitting cross-legged on a bamboo mat, raised slightly above me on a low dais. The top of her white sari was now modestly covering her plucked head. &#x201c;For many years, I fasted, or ate at most only once a day,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Like other nuns, I often experienced hunger and thirst. I tried to show compassion to all living creatures, and to avoid all forms of violence, passion or delusion. I wandered the roads of India barefoot.&#x201d; As she said this, the nun ran a hand up the hard and callused sole of her unshod foot. &#x201c;Every day I suffered the pain of thorns and blisters. All this was part of my effort to shed my last attachments in this illusory world.<br><br>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I still had one attachment&#x2014;though of course I didn&#x2019;t think of it in that way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;My friend Prayogamati,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;For twenty years we were inseparable companions, sharing everything. For our safety, we Jain nuns are meant to travel together, in groups or in pairs. It never occurred to me that I was breaking any of our rules. But because of my close friendship with her, I formed not just an attachment, but a strong attachment&#x2014;and that left an opening for suffering. But I only realised this after she died.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a pause, and I had to encourage Mataji to continue. &#x201c;In this stage of life we need company,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know, a companion with whom we can share ideas and feelings. After Prayogamati left her body, I felt this terrible loneliness. In truth, I feel it to this day. But her time was fixed. When she fell ill&#x2014;first with TB and then malaria&#x2014;her pain was so great she decided to take <i>sallekhana</i>, even though she was aged only thirty-six.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Sallekhana?</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ritual fast to the death. We Jains regard it as the culmination of our life as ascetics. It is what we all aim for, and work towards as the best route to Nirvana. Not just nuns&#x2014;even my grandmother, a lay person, took <i>sallekhana.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are saying she committed suicide?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no: <i>sallekhana</i> is not suicide,&#x201d; she said emphatically. &#x201c;It is quite different. Suicide is a great sin, the result of despair. But <i>sallekhana</i> is as a triumph over death, an expression of hope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you starve yourself to death, then surely you are committing suicide?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all. We believe that death is not the end, and that life and death...</p><h2>The Definitive Journals of Lewis and Clark, Vol 6: Down the Columbia to Fort Clatsop</h2><p>Since the time of Columbus, explorers dreamed of a water passage across the North American continent. President Thomas Jefferson shared this dream. He conceived the Corps of Discovery to travel up the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains and westward along possible river routes to the Pacific Ocean.

The object of the expedition was to cross the Antarctic overland. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their intended base, the ship was trapped, then crushed in ice. For five months Shackleton and his men, drifting on ice packs, were castaways on one of the most savage regions of the world. This utterly gripping book, based on firsthand accounts of crew members and interviews with survivors, describes how the men survived, how they lived together in camps on the ice for 17 months until they reached land, how they were attacked by sea leopards, had to kill their beloved dogs whom they could no longer feed, the diseases which they developed (an operation to amputate the foot of one member of the crew was carried out on the ice), and the extraordinary indefatigability of the men and their lasting civility towards one another in the most adverse conditions conceivable. This is a harrowing adventure and an extremely compelling book - destined to be a bestseller.</p><p>In the summer of 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton set off aboard the <i>Endurance</i> bound for the South Atlantic. The goal of his expedition was to cross the Antarctic overland, but more than a year later, and still half a continent away from the intended base, the <i>Endurance</i> was trapped in ice and eventually was crushed. For five months Shackleton and his crew survived on drifting ice packs in one of the most savage regions of the world before they were finally able to set sail again in one of the ship's lifeboats. Alfred Lansing's <i>Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage</i> is a white-knuckle account of this astounding odyssey. <p>Through the diaries of team members and interviews with survivors, Lansing reconstructs the months of terror and hardship the <i>Endurance</i> crew suffered. In October of 1915, there "were no helicopters, no Weasels, no Sno-Cats, no suitable planes. Thus their plight was naked and terrifying in its simplicity. If they were to get out--they had to get themselves out." How Shackleton did indeed get them out without the loss of a single life is at the heart of Lansing's magnificent true-life adventure tale.</p>'A superb account of the greatest survival story of our time' - Chris Bonington The story of Ernest Shackleton's epic journey to cross the Antarctic overland has now been turned into four hours of gripping television with Kenneth Branagh playing Shackleton. <p>Shackleton's mission failed, but the resulting adventure became one of the most celebrated accounts of man's survival against unbelievable odds. </p><p>In August 1914 the Endurance set sail for the South Atlantic. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their objective, the ship was trapped, then crushed in the ice. Twelve hundred miles away from land, drifting on ice packs, Shackleton and his men survived the next five months on a diet of dogs, penguins and seals. When the ship eventually sank they were forced to escape by lifeboat. Shackleton then travelled another 850 miles in an open boat across the stormiest ocean in the world to reach help. Every single man got home safely. </p><p>Miraculously, throughout this ordeal, the expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley, protected his negatives and photographs from destruction. It is these extraordinary photographs that are among those produced in this illustrated edition of Alfred Lansing's harrowing and inspiring classic.</p></p><h2>Collected Ghost Stories (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>'I was conscious of a most horrible smell of mould, and of a cold kind of face pressed against my own...'</strong><br><br>Considered by many to be the most terrifying writer in English, M. R. James was an eminent scholar who spent his entire adult life in the academic surroundings of Eton and Cambridge. His classic supernatural tales draw on the terrors of the everyday, in which documents and objects unleash terrible forces, often in closed rooms and night-time settings where imagination runs riot. Lonely country houses, remote inns, ancient churches or the manuscript collections of great libraries provide settings for unbearable menace, from creatures seeking retribution and harm.

Publishers Weekly<p><br>"James's stories succeed, I think, precisely because they hover at the margins of the unknown. His memorable images recall the night-terrors of childhood: the glimpsed figure on the lonely beach, the malevolent voice that whispers in your ear on a dark staircase.

But inside the house of just-married Simon and Esther, there was light and laughter. A long table covered with a striped cloth was pushed up close to the wall, and it was laden with earthenware platters decorated by palm fronds and piled high with eggplant and olives, with spit-roasted beef and lamb and fish, with rounds of flatbread, with grapes and oranges and figs and sweet cakes.<br><br> Beneath the table, sixteen-year-old Joseph sat cross-legged in silence, watching sandals and ankles and hems of tunics go by. No one had seen him&#x2014;he was almost totally obscured by the tablecloth&#x2014;and he enjoyed the anonymity. He was of course a man now, but he could not resist on occasion returning to the pleasures of boyhood. This was one such pleasure: to sit hidden and watch the elders as they drank ever more wine and acted ever more foolish. In the corner, he saw old Samuel weaving as he stood with his feet far apart, trying to focus on the face before him. Wine had sloshed from his wooden cup to dribble down his mantle. &#x201c;You will soon be on the floor,&#x201d; Joseph muttered, and was startled to hear a voice say, &#x201c;I am surprised he is not already.&#x201d;<br><br> Joseph turned to see a girl squatting just behind him. &#x201c;You have found the seat of honor,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;May I join you here?&#x201d;<br><br> There was something familiar about her. &#x201c;We are known to each other?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> She nodded. &#x201c;You have seen me many times. And you spoke to me when last you saw me. You came to the well when I was there last summer. I was gathering water with my mother; you were passing by with your father, Jacob.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Your memory serves you well. And I remember now, also. You are called Mary.&#x201d; She was a wonder to behold, with her black curls escaped from her braid, her cheeks flushed dusky rose, her gaze so direct and yet mysterious. She tucked her hair behind her ears, and he saw the lines of her high cheekbones beginning to assert themselves. Her lips were full and pink. He was suddenly dry-mouthed, his heart knocking about in his chest like a caged animal wild to be released.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I am Mary,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And you are called Joseph.&#x201d;<br><br> And her voice! Low and musical, laughlike. The utter completeness of her beauty was astonishing; it made for a rush of emotion in him so strong it felt like anger.<br><br> &#x201c;You have . . . grown,&#x201d; he told her, and his voice cracked, causing him to blush to the center of his soul.<br><br> She appeared not to notice but instead stared calmly into his eyes. &#x201c;And you also.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Newly thirteen. And you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Seventeen in two days.&#x201d;<br><br> They regarded each other carefully, and then he ducked down and pointed to the people before him who had joined hands and made a circle to dance. They whooped and called out to one another, stamped their feet, threw their heads back and laughed. &#x201c;They rejoice so!&#x201d; Joseph said, caught between wanting to admire them and to ridicule them. &#x201c;It is as though King Herod has died and the Messiah has come, both together!&#x201d;<br><br> She came closer and peered from beneath the cloth to see the dancers, then sat next to Joseph. &#x201c;It makes me happy, their happiness,&#x201d; she said, and there was in her<br><br> simple statement a truth that made him ashamed of his<br><br> ambivalence.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course it makes me glad as well,&#x201d; he said. What was it that she smelled of? It was a scent of air and water, of salt and bread, of the white blossoms that flowered on the olive branches. Of apricots and nuts. Of earth. He felt himself growing dizzy. He leaned back onto his elbows and looked at her. &#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d;<br><br> She cocked her head, puzzled. &#x201c;Nazareth.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> She raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br><br> He shook his head. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am from Nazareth! Unless you mean . . . ah. I was born in Sepphoris, but I came to Nazareth when I was just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said yet again.<br><br> She stared at him, then lowered her eyes. &#x201c;I believe you must know of my extraordinary circumstances.&#x201d; She looked up again. &#x201c;Is that what you mean to say?&#x201d;<br><br> He shrugged. &#x201c;Perhaps.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t know what he was saying. The girl confused and unsettled him.<br><br> She smiled, a warm, rich thing, full of its own intention&#x2014;he had never seen such a smile. But then her face grew serious. &#x201c;Behold; by a way known only unto you and God, you have come to know of my great secret, of my strange beginnings. I have never spoken of this to anyone, nor have my parents. But I will reveal all to you if you promise never to tell another. Will you promise?&#x201d;<br><br> He smiled uncertainly. She remained somber-faced and did not speak, waiting for him to agree to what she had asked. &#x201c;I promise,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> She nodded and resettled herself, sitting back on her heels and again anchoring her hair behind her ears. &#x201c;So be it. We have agreed that this will be known only to you and to my parents, now and forever, unto the end of the earth.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; His chest inflated with his importance.<br><br> She leaned in closer and spoke quietly. &#x201c;I was found beneath a date palm tree at the edge of the great Plain of Esdraelon. I was wrapped in cloth spun of gold, wearing a crown of jasmine flowers. Beside me were gifts of incense and linens, of spices and jewels, left for the one who would take me unto herself and raise me as her own.&#x201d;<br><br> He tried not to laugh.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I see that you cannot believe. You must not feel ashamed. It takes a man of rare qualities to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I believe,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I do! I believe!&#x201d;<br><br> Now she laughed. &#x201c;Then you have believed a lie. But the circumstances of my birth are yet more miraculous than what I have told you. My mother, Anne, was barren; but late in her life, an angel appeared before her and said&#x2014;&#x201d; Mary stopped and turned her head in the direction of a voice calling her name. Her high brow, her strong nose. &#x201c;I must go,&#x201d; she told him, pulling up her head covering and starting to crawl away from him.<br><br> He put his hand on her back. &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; When Mary turned to him, he found himself frustratingly wordless.<br><br> Again, they heard her name being called, more insistently this time.<br><br> &#x201c;I must go!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Until the next time!&#x201d; he managed.<br><br> She rose too quickly and knocked her head against the underside of the table, then turned back to Joseph, giggling.<br><br> He did not smile. He would kill the table, for hurting her.<br><br> He lay down on his stomach to watch her walk across the room. Her gait was slow and easy. She moved with her back straight and her head high, and her bearing suggested something beyond the normally erect posture seen in Nazarene women, who were so used to carrying heavy loads upon their heads. Mary took her mother&#x2019;s hand, then turned to look in Joseph&#x2019;s direction and smiled. His breath was tight, his belly aching. He watched as she and her parents headed out into the rain, then sat up and returned his attention to the flush-faced revelers and silently invited them to his own ceremony, now that he knew with certainty to whom he would be betrothed. It was as though it were written in the stars, and always had been. And always would be.<br><br> &#x201c;mother?&#x201d; he called. It was late into the night, and Joseph could not sleep. He had lain for at least an hour turning from one side to the other on his pallet, staring up at the ceiling, occasionally reaching out his hand to run it slowly along the mud wall, cool after the storm. Also he had touched himself, lightly and with wonder, understanding now the reason for his manhood.<br><br> &#x201c;Mother!&#x201d; he called again.<br><br> It was his father&#x2019;s frame that suddenly filled the low and narrow doorway. Joseph&#x2019;s mother had become an<br><br> increasingly sound sleeper. Also she had begun to grow a mustache.<br><br> &#x201c;What is it, my son?&#x201d; Jacob asked. &#x201c;Are you ill?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then why do you call so persistently, when your mother and I need to take our rest?&#x201d;<br><br> He did not answer, and his father moved closer. &#x201c;Joseph?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When will we see those people again?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What people?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The people who came to the wedding party tonight.&#x201d;<br><br> His father lifted his shoulders and made a sound deep in his throat. &#x201c;We all live in the same small village. We see one another often.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, but . . . the people Anne and Joachim, and their daughter, Mary. When will we see them again?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ahhhhhh,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;Have you interest in Mary?&#x201d;<br><br> Joseph said nothing.<br><br> His father clapped his hands together and his voice rose high and tight in happiness. &#x201c;I have waited long for this moment! I shall invite them to Sabbath dinner next week, that you may look again upon your Mary. And then we shall see what will happen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know already,&#x201d; Joseph said.<br><br> His father scratched at his side an...</p><h2>Rodale&#39;s Book of Practical Formulas: Easy-To-Make, Easy-To-Use, Recipes for Hundreds of Everyday Activities and Tasks</h2><p>Presents natural alternatives to toxic products featuring formulas for cleaning, gardening, home repair, car care, and beauty aids</p><p>Did you know you can polish brass with ketchup?

The Aesthetic Movement in America lasted just a few decades (1870-1900), and served mainly as a bridge between the high Victorian sensibility and the radical shift to the Arts &amp; Crafts style. The movement germinated among artists who used opulent color, decorative patterning, and lavish materials simply for the aesthetic effects they could evoke. It was commonly held that a home that expressed an artful, harmonious soul would instill high aesthetic and moral merit in its inhabitants. The Aesthetic Movement in America helped to popularize the idea that everyone should be able to enjoy beautiful, well-made homes and furnishings-not just the very wealthy. Artful homes could be composed from brilliant antique store finds, discriminating department store purchases, and gems hand-made by the ladies of the house. It was the moment when people embraced the idea that only a beautiful home could be a happy home. </p> <p>Karen Zukowski delves into the movement's establishment, evolution, and main characters, and shows how today's homes can incorporate Aesthetic principles: </p> <p>Through suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, massive use of symbols, and synaesthetic effects-that is, correspondence between words, colors and music. </p> <p>How influential designers such as Clarence Cook and Charles Eastlake popularized the idea that beautiful homes with tasteful furnishings could be available to practically everyone</p> <p>How today's designers, manufacturers, and retailers deploy the very same stylistic markers of the Aesthetic Movement: rich color, layered pattern and texture, mixtures of historical motifs</p></p><p><p>Creating the Artful Home: The Aesthetic Movement is the first in-depth look at late-nineteenth-century American home design and its cultural context. Average housewives transformed the radical premise of the Aesthetic movement-art for art's sake-into lush, nurturing homes. They believed that artful homes made people better, families happier, and society stronger. As it flowered in America, the Aesthetic movement became not so much a style as a process. The Aesthetic movement left us a legacy of Queen Anne houses and tidy suburbs, and its influence is now felt as Americans embrace the more-is-more philosophy of home furnishings.</p> <p>The Aesthetic movement grew out of the ideas and the products of English reformers, such as William Morris, and was flamboyantly promoted by Oscar Wilde in an 1882 lecture tour across America. Tastemakers rallied-Louis Comfort Tiffany became an interior designer while his father's firm, Tiffany and Company, produced Japoniste silver. Eastlake furniture invaded fashionable shops like Cottier's, and Oriental stores appeared even in small towns. Graphics transmitted the new design overtly through advertising and subtly through products like ubiquitous Staffordshire tableware. This book takes a thorough look at household furnishings, from the lavish productions of the Herter Brothers to humble Minton tiles.</p> <p>This volume will intrigue collectors, historians, and homemakers. Dozens of never-before-published illustrations, including rare color views of 1880s interiors and exteriors, shed new light on American houses. The author gives thoughtful insights into gender roles and the development of architecture as a moral imperative. Collectors will appreciate the thorough examination of historic architecture and furnishings and the glimpses of modern objects that show the same aesthetic. Most of all, the book gives modern homeowners insights into how American houses of the past have shaped our houses today-and how we might create our own artful homes in the future.</p>Karen Zukowski is an independent historian of late-nineteenth-century American visual culture, with a special interest in interiors. She holds a PhD from the City University of New York. She was the curator of Olana State Historic Site, one of the finest surviving Aesthetic Movement houses in America, built by Frederic Edwin Church, the Hudson River School painter. She is currently an adjunct faculty member in the Museum Studies department of New York University, and the Cooper Hewitt/Parsons MA program in the History of Decorative Arts and Design. She is an active member of several professional organizations for historic houses, and lives in New York City.</p><h2>Metallic Love (Silver Metal Lover)</h2><p><b>In her now-classic tale <i>The Silver Metal Lover</i>, award-winning author Tanith Lee told the spellbinding story of Jane and her forbidden love for a robot named Silver.

I liked her, too.<br>And I--am not Jane. Not in any single way. But one.<br>And that one single way is perhaps the only thing you and I also have in common.<br>Because if we liked Jane, we loved Silver.<br>Didn't we.<br>The temptation is to start this just as Jane did, with a description of my early life, and where I lived. Jane's mother was rich, and some of what Jane described might have been predictable--the travels, the house in the clouds. Even the way Jane came into existence--that was, selected, carried physically for five months, taken out very carefully, brought to full-term, and then nursed by machines--the Precipta method. But I was just born. I was a mistake. My mother made that very clear, apparently, when she dumped me ten months later on Grandfather.<br><br>I say Grandfather. He wasn't. He was the man my mother had herself lived with when she was a child. He had sort of brought her up, but then turned her out on the street when she was fifteen. He was a believer in the Apocalyte religion, and was pretty strict, and my mother was always in trouble of some sort--drink, drugs, legal and otherwise, men. When she gave me to him, she contemptuously told him, "Maybe you can do better with this one." The Apocalytes were "charitable." So they took me in. That was the first eleven, twelve years of my life, then, that gray-white wreck of a house on Babel Boulevard.<br><br>It was quite tough there. First the babies' room, which I don't remember. Then about twenty girls all ages in one dank dormitory. The roof leaked in the rain, and in summer you could hardly sleep for the scratching and shuffling of rats in the walls. Three grim, frugal meals a day in the communal hall. Lots of prayers. God was a wonderful being who wanted us to love him and sent us not only irresistible temptations we must ignore, but horrible mishaps--sickness, poverty, earthquake, and fire--to see if we would still do it. But if we did fall out of love with God, God got upset, and then he would make us burn in Hell forever. I swallowed all this along with the awful food. What else did I know? After all, the Big One was coming soon, the Day of Wrath, when the Asteroid, captured between Earth and moon about two decades before, would crash into the Earth and destroy us all, which is what had nearly happened previously. Whenever we strayed, Grandfather would take us up on the dodgy roof by night and show us the Asteroid, rising blue-green and molten over the slums. "Behold the eye of God's Destroying Angel," announced Grandfather. Hey, guys, you bet we tried to be good.<br><br>There were tremors once or twice, too, (quite a bad one when I was five) to help remind us. Quake-sites still existed all over the city, except in the richest areas, where they had been put right after the initial disturbance.<br><br>I suppose, growing up with this, I got used to it. Life was simple. Obey Grandfather, love God, wait for the Day of Wrath when we--the righteous ones--would be swept to Paradise on golden wings. Did I believe in Paradise? Perhaps. No, not really. Strange, maybe. I believed in all the bad things--Hell, punishment, an insecure and vengeful deity--but not in that.<br><br>There was a much larger earthquake when I was nine. It happened just before dawn. I remember waking--cold, there was snow on the ground--to hear the usual small tremor stuff, creakings, grunts of timber and brick, the shift of powder-dust dislodged and falling--and that rumble under the bed like a truck was revving up right outside. Oh, it's a tremor, I thought, and nearly went back to sleep. But then the rumble rose to a bellow, the mattress leapt, and part of the wonky ceiling dropped into the dorm and landed with a crash between the beds. Something even hit my legs--bounced off--I wasn't hurt. The girls started screaming then. Me, too. We pelted out of the room and tried to go downstairs, but some of the staircase had come apart. So someone said we should crawl up the swaying upper steps to the other end of the roof, the sounder reinforced area over Grandfather's room.<br><br>When we'd gotten up there--I'll never forget the roar and boom that was surging out of a city gone almost black but for the sprays of appalling lights like fireworks, which were flyer cables snapping, and power and electricity wires breaking and catching on fire. And next it was brighter because the sun was coming up, but also a couple of buildings were alight. Was it now? Was this it?<br><br>Then everything settled with a disgusting grinding crump. And Grandfather appeared up the fire escape, which was somehow still in one piece. Plaster dust in his iron hair only made him more apocalyptic. He led us at once in prayers of thankfulness to God, who had spared us even while he chastised the unholy city.<br><br>We were put on the lower floor for months, above the boys' dormitory, where there were only three or four weedy male kids, until some members of another house of the Order finally came and fixed the stairs and the roof a bit. Then we moved back to our own dorm. We couldn't sleep for a long time--too scared--but we were mostly children, and in the end we did. The aftershocks were slight, but a great deal of damage had been done in the city from the new quake.<br><br>A week after the quake anyhow, I was ten. My birthday was marked by a solemn blessing, and I had the special birthday privilege of washing the others' feet.<br><br>It was next year that I found the Book.<br>It was my week for washing dishes and I was down in the basement, doing just that. Outside it was dull and close, thundery, and through the very tops of the windows all I could see was a jagged line of brassy overcast above a broken wall. The water heater didn't work properly (not auto), and half the time I had to boil jugs on the nonauto electric stove. I was very hot and yawning so much with tiredness and boredom, I was nearly insane.<br><br>Then, crossing back to the stove for yet another jug, I trod on a slab of floor that shifted under me. I yelled, but there was no one else to hear. I thought the floor was giving way and I was going to fall down into a (Hellish?) abyss. But it wasn't that at all. When I righted myself, I saw that only a small square part of the floor had tilted, revealing a small dark slot beneath.<br><br>I--and countless others--had stumped over that floor a thousand times and never disturbed it. But one of the recent minor tremors must have loosened something, some glue or padding that had been used to close the little hatchway tight. And now it had only taken my narrow just-eleven-years-old foot, with about sixty-six pounds behind it, to tip the hatch open.<br><br>Of course I kneeled down and peered in. I didn't see what was there for a minute, because it was wrapped in a worn dark scarf. When finally I realized and pulled it out, the scarf itself tore at once in a ragged hole. I'd heard of people hiding money in old houses--obviously not I.M.U. cards, but nickels and dimes, or whole fortunes in antique gold. My heart stood still, and when I saw what was wrapped in the scarf was only a battered paper book, I felt a wrench of bitter disappointment. Maybe that was itself my first true whiff of rebellion--for I know, if it had been money, I'd never have told the Apocalytes. To them, to have wealth of any sort was just one more sinful Hell-deserving giving-in-to-temptation.<br><br>The cover of the book was plain resined black paper. Not knowing what else to do with it, I opened it. Which is what you do with a book, except I'd never had a chance to open anything but an improving religious tract. (Even the Bible was generally kept from us by Grandfather, who only occasionally read us alarming snippets.)<br><br>And the book's title seemed depressingly like those of some of the lesser religious works: <i>Jane's Story</i>. Under that, however, was this: <i>Published by Catch-Us-If-You-Can Press. Be advised, to possess this book is to risk intimidation and possible prosecution by the City Senate. Do not read this book in any public place--you have been warned!</i><br><br>I sat on my heels, gaping at the book, and in the background the jug was boiling dry on the stove.<br><br>Then I heard someone descending the stairs. I could tell from the flump of the footfall it was Big Joy, the oldest girl, who was in charge of the rest of us.<br><br>I found I'd gotten up and pushed the book in the pocket of my dishwashing overall. I kicked the hatch-thing back into place and ran for the jug. When Big Joy came in, I was lugging it over to the sink like a virtuous little Apocalyte. Joy was a bully, and perhaps, if it had been one of the others, I might have shared my discovery. I'll never be sure.<br><br>Someone else stumbled on the hatch, and hurt her ankle, a few days later. Obviously there was nothing in there by then.<br>Rather curiously I'd thought the book was ancient. (Like the fortune I'd hoped for?) But naturally it had been published by an underground press only a few years before I found it. I assume someone from outside, but still from our own beloved Order--one of the ones, probably, who came to fix the stair and roof--managed to set it in under the basement floor on Babel Boulevard. Either they were hiding it for their own safety, or they were passing on the Book, covertly, knowing that sometime it would again come to light, and then another person might read it. I think there was a lot of that with Jane and Silver's Book, as maybe you know. A whole kind of secret club, reading it, whispering about it, moving it along for others to read and whisper over. If you're reading this now, I guess you were part of that shining, shadowy chain.<br><br>I read it, too. Cover to cover.<br><br>What do I say to you, then, about reading that Book?<br><br>What would <i>you</i> say to <i>me</i>?<br><br>But maybe I presume. Maybe you didn't.<br><br>Okay. Plotline: There's this girl of sixteen (Jane), rich and naive, and under the thumb of her tyrannical, bloody, mind-fucking bitch of a mother--only Jane innocently doesn't know how terrible Mom is--but one day the girl meets a robot. Now we've had robots for ages, right. They do most of the jobs people used to--and so create a permanent underclass of unemployed subsistence plebs, like me. But anyway, we're accustomed to machines, and they are simply machines--boxes, tubes on wheels, faceplates that look as real as a badly made statue. Only this one is different. He's part of a new line designed for pleasure--of all and every sort. And he looks just like a man--a beautiful one. He's tall, strong, elegant, and handsome. A musician, a lover--and his skin is silver, his hair russet, his eyes amber. He truly does appear and feel--if you touch him, which is all you want to do--human. But he is to humanity what sunlight is to a low-wattage bulb. He is--indescribably--wonderful.<br><br>And Jane falls in love with him. And, <i>knowing</i> that no human could be <i>allowed</i> to love a <i>robot</i>--still she can't stop herself. So she leaves Dire Momma, and goes to live with Silver in the pits and craters of the slums. And he makes her life heaven on earth. And for the first time ever, she's--happy.<br><br>But then the firm that created him calls back all the robots of that special super-deluxe line. Something wrong with them, they say. But we all know, we who are reading <i>Jane's Story</i> of Silver, that all that's wrong in Silver's case, is he's too <i>right.</i><br><br>She tries her damnedest to save him. Gets betrayed--her evil little friends, Jason and Medea, her lunatic friend Egyptia. Life intervenes--earthquake, muddle. He's caught. They dismantle him. They kill him.<br><br>And she . . . <br><br>Jane tried to commit suicide. Didn't make it. But then she received a message from beyond the gate of death. Without a doubt it's him. He tells her things only she could know. Proves he is still alive after death . . . somewhere, out of the world. And proves, too, by doing the rest, that inside the robot body there had been a <i>soul.</i><br><br>So then Jane tries to go on living, living both her own life and his, knowing that one day, far, far off (for the rich can survive to be a hundred and fifty years of age) she will see him again.<br><br>That's the plot in the most crass terms, of Jane and Silver's Story.<br><br>Well. It changed my life.<br><br>I used to read it in the eye-aching half-dark of stubs of candles--in the basement at one a.m., the yard where the chickens were kept, on one of the lavatories, with people banging on the door and me calling, "I got sick!" and <i>retching </i>to show I needed to stay there. Chasing the truth of love.<br><br>Oh, Silver.<br><br>Silver.<br><br>When I finished that Book, I started again at the beginning.<br><br>I read it twelve times, that year between eleven and twelve.<br><br>Was apprehended only once.<br><br>"What are you doing <i>reading</i>, girl? You should be at prayers." "Sorry. Only this--" proffering the religious leaflet in which I had wrapped Jane's Book--and getting away with only a slap across my head.<br><br>I loved him. I loved him so. And through his strength and compassionate sweetness, I learned a lesson none of <i>them</i> had ever tried to teach me. That God might not be fire and hell and horror. That God was love. And so sometimes, here in this vicious world, love was to be found, too.<br><br>That was the lesson.<br><br>At twelve years old I had it--by <i>heart</i>.<br>*&nbsp; 2&nbsp; *<br>We went into the city quite often. An aspect of the Apocalytes' "mission" was to knock on doors or talk to people on the street and try and pin them down to a long old natter about the deity--i.e. how rotten the world was, how sinful they were, and that ours was the only means of salvation.<br><br>After the quake when I was nine/ten, we'd even made a bit of progress. A couple of scared citizens signed up for our regime of total self-denial and utter hatred of all physical enjoyments. No drink, no cigarines, no painkillers even--sex only in the effort to construct one more little Apocalyte. But strangely, not everyone was keen.</p><h2>Danubia: A Personal History of Habsburg Europe</h2><p><p><b>A charmingly personal history of Hapsburg Europe, as lively as it is informative, by the author of <i>Germania</i> </b><br><b></b><br>For centuries much of Europe and the Holy Roman Empire was in the royal hands of the very peculiar Habsburg family. An unstable mixture of wizards, obsessives, melancholics, bores, musicians and warriors, they saw off&#x2015;through luck, guile and sheer mulishness&#x2015;any number of rivals, until finally packing up in 1918. From their principal lairs along the Danube they ruled most of Central Europe and Germany and interfered everywhere&#x2015;indeed the history of Europe hardly makes sense without the House of Hapsburg.<br><i></i><br><i>Danubia, </i>Simon Winder's hilarious new book, plunges the reader into a maelstrom of alchemy, royalty, skeletons, jewels, bear-moats, unfortunate marriages and a guinea-pig village. Full of music, piracy, religion and fighting, it is the history of a strange dynasty, and the people they ruled, who spoke many different languages, lived in a vast range of landscapes, believed in rival gods and often showed a marked ingratitude towards their oddball ruler in Vienna. Readers who discovered Simon Winder's storytelling genius and infectious curiosity in<i> Germania</i> will be delighted by the eccentric and fascinating tale of the Habsburgs and their world.</p></p><p><b>Simon Winder</b> is the author of two books: the <i>Sunday</i> <i>Times</i> (London) Top Ten Bestseller <i>Germania</i> and the highly praised <i>The Man Who Saved Britain</i>. He works in publishing and lives in Wandsworth Town, London.<p>&#x201c;[Winder] never stops talking and rarely pauses for breath. Even then, however, you want to tell him: Forget about breathing and just go on talking. <i>Danubia</i> is a long book, yet this reader would not mind if it were longer still.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew Wheatcroft, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;In a rollicking book that is part travelogue and part history, Winder takes up the unwieldy topic of the Habsburgs. The sprawling family empire ruled much of Europe for more than centuries, owing to a combination of 'cunning, dimness, luck, and brilliance.' From the Middle Ages until the end of the First World War, Winder writes, 'there was hardly a twist in Europe's history to which they did not contribute.' Winder, whose best-seller <i>Germania </i>took a similar approach to German history, explores the story of the dynasty and the lasting imprint of its reign by travelling the expanse of its former empire and giving a lively account of his research. He is thorough and funny, and the book is rich with anecdotes and enthusiastic appreciation, and it includes a broad survey of the artifacts and landscapes that tell the story of the family that laid the foundation of modern Europe.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrea Denhoed, Page-Turner, The New Yorker online</i></p><p>&#x201c;Making five centuries of Habsburg history fun seems like a tall order, but Winder pulls it off. He entertains because he is entertained . . . With unrelenting wit--sometimes smirking but also self-mocking--he traces the Habsburgs' fortunes . . . What gives the text verve is Winder's ability to interweave the eccentric details of the Habsburgs themselves with an absorbing cultural history, driven by his exuberant passion for the lives and music of great composers and textured by his skillful physical descriptions of forgotten corners of the realm.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Foreign Affairs</i></p><p>&#x201c;With hearty dollops of humor in a unique blend of travel writing, historiography and speculation, Simon Winder remains clear-eyed and witty . . . Danubia is thick with scoundrels, dullards, the occasional wizard--and great art, architecture and musicians from Haydn to Mr. Winder's spiritual doppelganger, the mysterious Romanian Bela Bartok.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Carlo Wolff, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></p><p>&#x201c;As with his previous work <i>Germania</i>, Winder describes this account as a &#x2018;personal history', allowing him space for whimsy, for a great deal of Haydn, for careful analysis of paintings and the freedom to favour certain emperors because they were interesting people rather than political heavyweights. It all makes for an excellent, rich and amusing read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Roger Boyes, The Times (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Winder is a puppishly enthusiastic companion: funny, erudite, frequently irritating, always more in control of his material than he pretends to be, and never for a moment boring . . . <i>Danubia</i> is a moving book, and also a sensuous one: we feel the weight of imperial coins, hear and smell the &#x2018;medals and spurs clinking and everything awash in expensive gentleman's fragrances' as emperors and regiments meet at formal occasions. Winder says he researched it largely on foot, seeking out museums and castles, and listened to all 106 Haydn symphonies just to get in the mood . . . Miniaturist in its eye for detail, grand in its scope, it skips beats and keeps our attention all the way.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sarah Bakewell, The Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Winder's amalgam of travelogue and personal history follows on from his bestselling account of Germany, <i>Germania</i>, and is similarly infectious in its enthusiasms. In pages of cheerful, slang-dotted prose, <i>Danubia</i> dilates knowledgeably on the Habsburg dynasty as it flourished along the river from its source in Bavarian hills through Austro-Hungary and the Balkans to the Black Sea . . . <i>Danubia</i> is a hoot and well worth reading.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ian Thomson, The Independent (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Winder] is an extremely interesting fellow and a very good writer . . . the journey is so interesting, exciting and very often laugh-out-loud hilarious . . .

As historian Vernon Benjamin chronicles, the Hudson River Valley has been a place of contradictions since its first settlement by Europeans. Discovered by an Englishman who claimed it for the Dutch, the region soon became home to the most vibrant trading outpost for the New World colonies&#x2015;the Island of Manhattan&#x2015;even as the rest of the valley retained the native beauty that would inspire artists from James Fenimore Cooper to Thomas Cole. Because of its unique geography and proximity to Canada, the Hudson Valley became the major theater for the battle between empires in the French and Indian War. When the colonists united in rebellion against the British several decades later, conflict came to the region once again, with decisive military engagements from Saratoga to West Point to the occupied New York Harbor. In the aftermath, New York emerged as the capital of a new nation, and wealth from the city flowed north to the burgeoning Valley, leading to a renaissance of culture and commerce that is still evident today. Richly illustrated and scrupulously researched, Vernon Benjamin&#x2019;s magisterial new history will be the definitive text for years to come.</p><p>Vernon Benjamin has lectured on the history of the Hudson Valley at Marist College and Bard College since 2003.

He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, and like many kids with AS, Jacob has a special focus on one subject--in his case, forensic analysis. He's always showing up at crime scenes, thanks to the police scanner he keeps in his room, and telling the cops what they need to do...and he's usually right. But then his town is rocked by a terrible murder and, for a change, the police come to Jacob with questions. All of the hallmark behaviors of Asperger's--not looking someone in the eye, stimulatory tics and twitches, flat affect--can look a lot like guilt to law enforcement personnel. Suddenly, Jacob and his family, who only want to fit in, feel the spotlight shining directly on them. For his mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication of why nothing is normal because of Jacob. And over this small family the soul-searing question looms: Did Jacob commit murder?</p><p> Emotionally powerful from beginning to end, House Rules looks at what it means to be different in our society, how autism affects a family, and how our legal system works well for people who communicate a certain way--and fails those who don't.</p><p> Explore the reading group guide for <i>House Rules</i>. </p> <p><strong>A Conversation with Author Jodi Picoult</strong><br><br> </p><p><b>Q:</b> How did you first decide upon Asperger's Syndrome as the focus for this novel?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I have a cousin who's autistic. Several times, my aunt found herself in a public place trying to control one of his meltdowns--and people who didn't understand why she was restraining him contacted authorities and made allegations of abuse. As he got older, and moved into a group home, his frustrations became more intense because of his size--he'd break in windows with his fist, for example--and several times the police were called. It got me thinking that the legal system works really well, if you communicate a certain way. But if you don't, it all goes to Hell in a handbasket really quickly. A lot of the hallmark behaviors of autism--flat affect, stimming, not looking someone in the eye--could very easily be misinterpreted as signs of guilt.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> You have been known to do extensive research about the topics in your books. What was the research process like for this novel?<br><br> <b>A:</b> In addition to meeting with attorneys to get the legal information accurate, I met with six teens with Asperger's, and their parents--face to face. Even though some of the kids were very awkward in a direct setting, I needed to experience that to understand how the rest of the world would feel coming in contact with Jacob. But kids with Asperger's, who are so smart, shine when you let them answer questions on paper. So another 35 teens and their parents answered lengthy questionnaires for me about themselves, their reactions to situations, their lives, their hopes, their frustrations. It made for some incredible reading, and many of their direct experiences wound up in Jacob's life. One of these young women with Asperger's Syndrome was so detailed in her writing and so open about her experiences that she volunteered to help me further. She read the manuscript for accuracy and told me, based on Jacob's voice, what seemed consistent and what, in her opinion, Jacob would never say or do. The last bit of research I did was incredibly fun--I shadowed a CSI for a week. I got to learn blood spatter analysis, to do presumptive semen tests, to check out crime scenes, and to observe an autopsy. It was fascinating!<br><br> <b>Q:</b> When your central characters are in a real-life situation that affects so many people around the world--in this case, dealing with the effects of Asperger's Syndrome and autism on a family--is there more pressure on you as the author to "get it right"?<br><br> <b>A:</b> It doesn't really matter whether it's Asperger's or a rape victim or a cancer patient--when research subjects open up to me with such honesty I ALWAYS feel a responsibility to "get it right."<br><br> <b>Q:</b> If you could say one thing to the families who are dealing with the effects of having an autistic child, what would it be?<br><br> <b>A:</b> That you're not alone--and that, hopefully, more and more people will come to understand that a child who's "different from" is not one who is "lesser than."<br><br> <b>Q:</b> In a previous interview, you referred to your novels taking part in a long line of "moral and ethical fiction." When you first began writing, did you have the intention of using your work as a springboard for conversation about moral and ethical issues? Or did that come later on?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I think I started gravitating toward that sort of niche as I kept writing. I have always written about subjects that engage me--questions I can't answer myself. They apparently tend to be big moral and ethical issues! But I never lose sight of the fact that before I was a writer, I was a teacher. I still am. My classroom's just gotten a little bigger.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> <i>House Rules</i> is your seventeenth novel. Do you feel your writing has changed since your first novel? If so, was it an intentional change, or is it something you've noticed over time?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I think my writing has become "cleaner." By that I mean that technically I've improved--I might turn a metaphor in five words now, where years ago, it would have taken me a paragraph. I can't say it was intentional--but you know what they say about practice making perfect...!<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Why did you choose to end the book when you did, rather than going into what happens to the characters in the aftermath of the trial?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Because at heart, this is Jacob's book. And remember, to Jacob, there was never any real mystery here, was there?<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Could you talk for a moment about Emma's character and her struggles throughout the book? You've said that your characters' voices come to you, that they take on a life of their own. Did you find yourself agreeing with Emma's choices as the novel progressed?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I think Emma is a very typical, very overwhelmed mom. A lot of the moms of autistic kids I met are so consumed with being their child's advocate that there's no room for anything else--least of all themselves. It's why so many marriages end in divorce, when a child is diagnosed on the spectrum. Emma's journey in this book is one of unwinding--allowing herself to define herself as more than just Jacob's mother, because that's been completely eroded by his autism.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> If the main characters in this novel had favorite books, what do you think they would be?<br><br> <b>A:</b> What a great question! I think Jacob's would be, clearly, anything written by Dr. Henry Lee. Oliver would love <em>Presumed Innocent</em> by Turow--it's probably why he decided to go to law school. Theo would read Vonnegut. He wouldn't understand Vonnegut, but he'd think it's the kind of thing a rebel would read. Rich--I think he's a closet softy, the kind of guy who's got a dog-eared copy of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> in his nightstand. And dare I hope that Emma reads Jodi Picoult novels?<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Could you give us a glimpse into your next project?<br><br> <b>A:</b> <i>Sing You Home</i>, the 2011 book, is the story of Zoe Baxter, who has spent ten years trying to get pregnant. After multiple miscarriages and infertility issues, it looks like her dream is about to come true--she is seven months pregnant. But a terrible turn of events takes away the baby she has already fallen for; and breaks apart her marriage to Max. In the aftermath, she throws herself into her career as a music therapist--using music clinically to soothe burn victims in a hospital; to help Alzheimer's patients connect with the present; to provide solace for hospice patients. When Vanessa--a guidance counselor--asks her to work with a suicidal teen, their relationship moves from business to friendship and then, to Zoe's surprise, blossoms into love. When Zoe allows herself to start thinking of having a family, again, she remembers that there are still frozen embryos that were never used by herself and Max.<br><br> Meanwhile, Max has found peace at the bottom of a bottle--until he is redeemed by an evangelical church, whose charismatic pastor--Clive Lincoln--has vowed to fight the "homosexual agenda" that has threatened traditional family values in America. But this mission becomes personal for Max, when Zoe and her same-sex partner say they want permission to raise his unborn child.<br><br> <i>Sing You Home</i> explores what it means to be gay in today's world, and how reproductive science has outstripped the legal system. Are embryos people or property? What challenges do same-sex couples face when it comes to marriage and adoption? What happens when religion and sexual orientation--two issues that are supposed to be justice-blind--enter the courtroom? And most importantly, what constitutes a "traditional family" in today's day and age?<br><br> Also--in a very unique move--readers will get to literally hear Zoe Baxter's voice. I am collaborating with Ellen Wilber, a dear friend who is also a very talented musician, to create a CD of original songs, which will correspond to each of the chapters. This CD will be packaged with each hardcover book.

Vienna was home to such figures as Sigmund Freud, Gustav Klimt, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal; Budapest produced such luminaries as B�la Bart�k, Georg Luk�cs, and Michael and Karl Polanyi. However, as P�ter Han�k shows in these vignettes of Fin-de-Si�cle life, the intellectual and artistic vibrancy common to the two cities emerged from deeply different civic cultures.</p><p>Han�k surveys the urban development of the two cities and reviews the effects of modernization on various aspects of their cultures. He examines the process of physical change, as rapid population growth, industrialization, and the rising middle class ushered in a new age of tenements, suburbs, and town planning. He investigates how death and its rituals--once the domain of church, family, and local community--were transformed by the commercialization of burials and the growing bureaucratic control of graveyards. He explores the mentality of common soldiers and their families--mostly of peasant origin--during World War I, detecting in letters to and from the front a shift toward a revolutionary mood among Hungarians in particular. He presents snapshots of such subjects as the mentality of the nobility, operettas and musical life, and attitudes toward Germans and Jews, and also reveals the striking relationship between social marginality and cultural creativity.</p><p>In comparing the two cities, Han�k notes that Vienna, famed for its spacious parks and gardens, was often characterized as a "garden" of esoteric culture. Budapest, however, was a dense city surrounded by factories, whose cultural leaders referred to the offices and caf�s where they met as "workshops." These differences were reflected, he argues, in the contrast between Vienna's aesthetic and individualistic culture and Budapest's more moralistic and socially engaged approach. Like Carl Schorske's famous <i>Fin-de-Si�cle Vienna</i>, Han�k's book paints a remarkable portrait of turn-of-the-century life in Central Europe. Its particular focus on mass culture and everyday life offers important new insights into cultural currents that shaped the course of the twentieth century.</p><p>Originally published in 1998.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p>Cultural historians have long been intrigued with how such cultural treasures as impressionism, psychoanalysis, and the New School of Music could flourish in the depleted soils of fin-de-si�cle Vienna--and, not very far behind, Budapest--at a time when the empire was exhausted and eroding. "Was this culture inspired by the 'slight rapture of death,'" asks cultural historian P�ter Han�k, "or was the whole structure void of a foundation and its glitter nothing more than a mirage?" The period prior to the First World War was indeed a golden age, albeit wobbly.<p> The formal tone and well-organized presentation of these essays conceals a sprightly diversity of themes. What thread can possibly link the fin-de-si�cle perception of death, popular letters of social grievance, and the worldwide success of the theatrical genre common to both cities--operetta? It is the author's concept of cultural history that provides the thread. Han�k's focus is not trained on cultural masterpieces, but on the "real world" of urban mass culture and the cultural products of peasants.</p><p> The theme of urbanization, dealing with all major areas of cultural history, opens the study. Chapter 2 looks at the development of prejudice in this Central European cauldron, analyzing anti-German and anti-Semitic images.

His victory in the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, the landmark Supreme Court case outlawing school segregation, would have made him a historic figure even if he had not gone on to become the first African-American appointed to the Supreme Court. As a young lawyer, Marshall dealt with criminal cases in which blacks were routinely sent to their deaths with barely a trial, and he was once nearly lynched while defending a client. <br>Remembered as a gruff, aloof figure, Marshall in fact had great charisma and a large appetite for life. Away from the courtroom, he was a glamorous figure in Harlem circles, known as a man-about-town who <br>socialized with prizefighter Joe Louis, singer Cab Calloway, and other black luminaries. He lived in every decade of the century and knew every president from Franklin Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, becoming a respected member of Washington's power elite, known for his savvy and quick wit.<br>But beneath Marshall's charm was a hard-nosed drive to change America that led to surprising clashes with Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, and Malcolm X. Most intriguing of all was Marshall's secret and controversial relationship with FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, revealed here for the first time. <br>Based on eight years of research and interviews with over 150 sources, Thurgood Marshall is the sweeping and inspirational story of an enduring figure in American life, a descendant of slaves who became a true hero for all people. As Juan Williams shows, in page after vivid page, Thurgood Marshall fulfilled the promise of democracy and changed our history.</p><p><i>Washington Post</i> correspondent and TV commentator Juan Williams has produced an illuminating look at a true giant of 20th-century American politics. Williams retells the story of Thurgood Marshall's successful desegregation of public schools in the U.S. with his victory in the case of <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i>, followed by his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1967 for a 24-year term. But he also recounts how W.E.B. Du Bois, then the head of the NAACP, gave a cold shoulder to the younger Marshall (who eventually helped oust Du Bois from the organization), and describes the tug of war between Marshall and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, as well as the mind games Lyndon Johnson played on Marshall before nominating him for the Supreme Court. Readers also learn about Marshall's relationship with his replacement, Clarence Thomas, which was surprisingly civil given their contrary views on affirmative action. Williams has captured many examples of Thurgood Marshall's heroism and humanity in this comprehensive yet readable biography of a complex, combative, and courageous civil rights figure. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>Times Books editor Jon Karp: A great deal has been written about Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, but as Juan Williams proves in this illuminating biography, the true architect of America's civil rights movement was Thurgood Marshall. It was Marshall who engineered the legal strategy that integrated America's schools, neighborhoods, businesses, and voting booths, and it was his advocacy of affirmative action that gave black Americans entry to places from which they had previously been denied. All of this occurred well before Marshall's ascension to the Supreme Court, on which he served for 25 years, playing a crucial role in a number of the most important legal decisions of our time.<p><br>In other words, Thurgood Marshall is a major American figure who lived at the center of race relations in America for over fifty years. Until now, Marshall has never been the subject of a thoroughly researched biography for general readers, and now, we have the ideal biographer: Juan Williams, a nationally known commentator, Washington Post reporter, Emmy-award winning documentary writer, and best-selling author of EYES ON THE PRIZE. This book is Juan's magnum opus. He's been working on it for the past eight years, interviewed over 150 sources, and conducted over 20 hours of exclusive interviews with Marshall.</p><p> <br>This book is the definitive word on Marshall's life. Juan Williams takes us behind the scenes during all of the important movements in Marshall's career: His early criminal cases, in which he fought to save the lives of innocent black men on death row and developed a life-long opposition to the death penalty; his pioneering desegregation and voting rights cases in Texas; the incredible story of the time he was almost lynched after successfully arguing a case in Mississippi; plus his legendary work on Brown versus The Board of Education; his battle with Bobby Kennedy to secure an appointment as a federal court judge; his negotiations with J. Edgar Hoover, who was an enemy at first and later an important ally, and the inside story of how Marshall helped Hoover uproot communists from the NAACP; and his years on the Supreme Court, where he frustrated conservatives by holding onto his seat and fighting for the disenfranchised longer than anyone ever expected.</p><p><br>While I was reading this book, I realized that there is nobility to Marshall's life. His is a classic inspirational American story, up from nowhere, propelled by will and wit and all the way to the highest levels of power in the United States. This is a sweeping study of an iconic figure in American life, an ordinary man who became extraordinary and changed our history.<br></p></p><h2>X-Men Forever 4: Devil in a White Dress (X-Men, 4)</h2><p>When Rogue and Nightcrawler investigate a distress call in New Orleans, they come face to face with the mutant villain Mystique.</p><p></p><h2>The Baby Sister</h2><p>Tommy has an older brother named Buddy and lots and lots of cousins. So when his mother tells him that a new brother or sister is on the way, Tommy asks her for a baby sister with a red ribbon in her hair. <br><br>But this is more than the story of Tommy and the family getting ready for the baby. At its heart is the relationship between Tommy and his Italian grandmother, Nana Fall- River, not quite understanding each other at a time when Tommy is excited about the baby yet missing his mother in the hospital.

By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration.</p><p>Tomie dePaola has published almost 200 children's books in fifteen different countries. He remains one of the most popular creators of books for children, receiving more than 100,000 fan letters each year.</p><p>Tomie lives in an interesting house in New Hampshire with his four dogs.

In tightly framed paintings, the boy helps ready the nursery; draws and cuts paper decorations (his signature birds, hearts, and flowers); and eagerly awaits Aunt Nell's arrival. However, when his mother goes to the hospital, it is his forceful and dour Italian Nana who happens to be available for baby-sitting. Worse, because chicken pox is going around, Tommy can't even visit his mother after his sister is born. But all ends well?he and his Nana patch up their quarrels, and he gets to hold Maureen when all the relatives have gathered. This title goes along with The Art Lesson (1994), Tom (1993), and Nana Upstairs &amp; Nana Downstairs (1973, all Putnam), all tales based on dePaola's memories. As a "waiting for the baby to arrive" story, though, this one seems as sedate and old-fashioned as its late-1930s setting.?Susan Hepler, Alexandria City Public Schools, VA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Of Women and Horses: Essays by Various Horse Women</h2><p>An illustrated survey of great horsewomen introduces women from all walks of life as they explore their love of horses.</p><p>It seems that almost all little girls in North America love horses and many women have a palpable affection. -- <i>ForeWord Magazine</i></p><h2>The Hope of Spring: Part 3 (The Discovery - A Lancaster County Saga)</h2><p><p><b>A</b><i><b> New&nbsp;York Times</b></i><b> Bestseller!<br> Book 3 of&nbsp;an exclusive 6-consecutive-month release Amish serial novel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>In <i>The Hope of Spring</i>, part three of New York Times Bestselling author, Wanda E.

Bird's compliance with her doctor's orders took her to the wildest regions of the American West, Malaysia, Kurdistan, Persia, the Moroccan desert, and China, among other places. One of nine popular accounts of her adventures around the world, <i>Unbeaten Tracks in Japan </i>traces the intrepid Victorian explorer's 1878 excursion into the back country of the Far East.<br>Japan had just opened its doors to the West within the past decade, and Bird traversed regions unknown to many of the island nation's inhabitants. Traveling more than 1,400 miles by pack horse, rickshaw, and foot, she followed winding mountain trails and crossed countless rivers to meet villagers in their remote communities and peasant farmers in their fields. In poignant, vivid letters to her sister and friends, Bird describes the vicissitudes of her journey--the discomforts and difficulties as well as the pleasures and excitement of discovery. 40 of the author's own sketches and photographs illustrate her captivating stories.</p><p>* Set in slightly larger type for easier reading. <p>* With a map showing Isabella fs route. </p><p>* Including a new foreword: Reading between the Lines.</p>PREFACE (BY THE AUTHOR; ABRIDGED) <p>Having been recommended to leave home, in April 1878, in order to recruit my health by means which had proved serviceable before, I decided to visit Japan, attracted less by the reputed excellence of its climate than by the certainty that it possessed, in an especial degree, those sources of novel and sustained interest which conduce so essentially to the enjoyment and restoration of a solitary health-seeker. The climate disappointed me, but, though I ` found the country a study rather than a rapture, its interest exceeded my largest expectations. </p><p>This is not a gBook on Japan, h but a narrative of travels in Japan, and an attempt to contribute something to the sum of knowledge of the present condition of the country, and it was not till I had travelled for some months in the interior of the main island and in Yezo that I decided that my materials were novel enough to render the contribution worth making. From Nikko northwards my route ` was altogether off the beaten track, and had never been traversed in its entirety by any European. I lived among the Japanese, and saw their mode of living, in regions unaffected by European contact. As a lady travelling alone, and the first European lady who had been seen in several districts through which my route lay, my experiences differed more or less widely from those of preceding travellers; and I am able to offer a fuller account of the aborigines of Yezo, obtained by actual acquaintance with them, than has hitherto been given. These are my chief reasons for offering this volume to the public. </p><p>.... </p><p>Isabella L.

Although Kraus casts a skeptical eye at the genre that's come to be known as &#x201c;social practice,&#x201d; her book is less a critique than a proposition as to how art might be read through desire and circumstance, delirium, gossip, coincidence, and revenge.

The Charwoman&#39;s Shadow is a beautiful tale of a sorcerer&#39;s apprentice who discovers his master&#39;s nefarious usage of stolen shadows, and vows to save the charwoman from her slavery.</p><p>Lord Dunsany was Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, the eighteenth baron of an ancient line. He hunted lions in Africa, taught English in Athens, fought in the Boer and Kaiserian wars, and was wounded in the service of his country. As senior peer of Ireland, he saw three sovereigns crowned at Westminster; part of the renaissance of Irish drama, he hobnobbed with Yeats and Synge and Lady Gregory during the great days of Dublin&#39;s Abbey Theatre. He was peer, sportsman, soldier, playwright, globe-trotter, and once chess champion of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. He wrote more than sixty books before his death in 1957 and influenced some of the greatest writers of our time.<b>The Lord of the Tower Finds a Career for His Son</b><br><br>Picture a summer evening sombre and sweet over Spain, the glittering sheen of leaves fading to soberer colours, the sky in the west all soft, and mysterious as low music, and in the east like a frown. Picture the Golden Age past its wonderful zenith, and westering now towards its setting.<br><br>In such a time of day and time of year, and in such a time of history, a young man was travelling on foot on a Spanish road, from a village wellnigh unknown, towards the gloom and grandeur of mountains. And as he travelled a wind rising up with the fall of day flapped his cloak hugely about him.<br><br>The strength of the wind grew, until little strange cries were in it; the slope steepened, the daylight waned; and the man and his cloak and the evening so merged into one darkness that even in imagination I can but dimly see him now.<br><br>Let us therefore turn to such questions as who he was, and how he came to be faring at such an hour towards a region so rocky and lonely as that which loomed before him, while the latest stragglers amongst other men were nearing their houses amongst the sheltered fields.<br><br>His name was Ramon Alonzo Matthew-Mark-Luke-John of the Tower and Rocky Forest. And his father had lately called to him as he played at ball with his sister, beating it back and forth to each other over a deep yew hedge; and the ball had a row of feathers fixed all round it to make it fly gently and fairly; and the yew hedge ended at a white balustrade, and beyond that lay the wild rocks and the frown of the forest: his father called to him and he entered the house out of the mellow evening, praying his sister to wait; but he talked with his father till all the light was gone, and they played at ball no more.<br><br>And in such a manner as this spoke the Lord of the Tower and Rocky Forest to his son when they were seated before the logs in the room where the boar-spears hung. "Whether to hunt the boar or the stag be sweeter I know not; methinks the boar, but only the blessed Saints know which is truly the sweeter: and yet there are other considerations besides these, and the world were happier were it not so, yet it is ever thus." And the boy nodded his head, for he knew what it was of which his father would speak, that it was of lucre, which hath much to do with worldly affairs: the good fathers had warned him of it. And indeed of this very thing his father told.<br><br>"For however vile or dross-like," he said, "gold be in itself, and I do not ask you to doubt the ill repute you have learned of it in the school on the high hill, yet is it necessary in curious ways to many things that are good, as certain foulnesses nourish the roots of the vine. For Emanuel and Mark are of such a kind that they will have their regular payment year in year out for such work as they do with the horses, nor is Peter any better in the garden, and it is indeed the same in the dairy. And then there was the teaching that you received from the good fathers on their high hill, much of this dross went also there though the work itself was a blessed one. And now it is necessary to put yet more of this gold in a box, and to have it ready against some day when a dowry will be needed for your sister, for she is already past fifteen. And, the rocky structure of our soil being unsuited to husbandry, gold is not easily wrung from it, and there is little of a worldly nature to be won from the forest; and to <br>me it seems that as sin increases on Earth the need for gold grows greater.<br><br>"For myself, if the getting of gold be an art, as some have said, I am past the time for learning a new art; and, if it be a sin, my sins are over. Yet you my son may haply gather this great necessity for us, or this evil, whatever it be; and, if it be a sin, what is one more sin to youth? Not much, I fear."<br><br>The youth crossed himself.<br><br>"And follow not the way of the sword," continued his father, in no whit diverted from his discourse, "for the lawyers ever defeat it with their pens, as hath been said of old; but follow the Art, and you shall deal in a matter at whose mention lawyers pale."<br><br>"The Black Art!" exclaimed Ramon Alonzo.<br><br>"There is but one art," said his father; "and it shall all the more advantage you to follow it in that there hath been of late but little magic in Spain, and even in this forest there are not, but on rarest evenings, such mysteries nor such menace as I myself can remember; and no dragon hath been seen since my grandfather's days."<br><br>"The Black Art!" said Ramon Alonzo. "But how shall I tell of this to Father Joseph?"<br><br>And his father rubbed his chin awhile before he spoke again.<br><br>"'Twere hard indeed," he said, "to tell so good a man. Yet are we in sore need of gold, and God forbid in His mercy that one of us should ever follow a trade."<br><br>"Amen," said his son.<br><br>And the fervour with which the boy had said Amen heartened his father to hope he would do his bidding, and cheered him on the way with his discourse, which he continued as follows.<br><br>"There is dwelling in the mountains, a day's walk beyond Aragona (whose spires we see), a magician known to my father. For once my father hunting a stag in his youth went far into the mountains, as goodly a stag as ever rejoiced a hunter, though once I killed one as good but never better. I killed mine in the year of the great snowfall, the year before you were born; it had come down from the mountains. But my father hunted his up from the valley where it had been feeding all night at the edges of gardens; it went home to the mountains, and in dense woods on the slope my father killed it at evening. And then the most curious man he had ever known came down the rocks, walking gently, wearing a black silk cloak, to where he was skinning the stag with tired hounds sitting round him, and asked my father if he studied magic. And my father said that hunting the stag and the boar were the only studies he knew. And well indeed he studied them, and he taught me, but not all he knew for no man could learn so much. And<br> then he told the magician something of how to hunt boars; and the magician was pleased, for men shunned him much, and seldom spoke from their hearts of the things they loved, before his portentous cloak and his strange wise eye. And my father warmed to the tales as he told of the thing he had studied; and the stars came twinkling out above the magician, and the gloom was enormous in the ominous wood, and still my father told of the ways of boars, for there was never fear in my father. And the magician asked my father if there was any favour he would have of him, and my father said, 'Yes,' for he had ever wondered at the art of writing, and he asked the magician if he would write for him. And this the magician did, withdrawing a cork from a horn that hung from his girdle and that was filled with ink, and taking a goose-quill and writing there in the wood upon a little scroll that he took from a satchel. And they parted in the wood, and my father remembered that day all his years, as much for what he had see<br>n the magician do as for the splendid horns he had won that day. And when the writing came to be read it was seen that it was a letter of friendship or welcome to my father or to whomever he should send with that scroll to the house in the wood.<br><br>"Now my father cared only to hunt the boar and the stag and had no need of magic, and I have had nothing to do with parchments nor writings. But I can find the scroll at this moment among the tusks of boars that my father laid by, and you shall have the scroll and go to the wood and say to that magician, 'I am the grandson of him that taught you of the taking of boars nigh eighty years agone.'"<br><br>"But will he yet live?" asked Ramon.<br><br>"He were no magician else," replied his father.<br><br>And the boy sat silent then, regretting the thoughtlessness that his hasty words had revealed.<br><br>"With the mystery of writing, which you will doubtless study there, I have myself some acquaintance, having sufficiently studied the matter, some while since, to be able to practise it should the occasion ever arise: but of all mysteries that he hath the skill to teach you the one to study most diligently is that one which concerns the making of gold. Yes, yes," he said, silencing with a wave or two of his hand some hasty youthful objection that he saw on the boy's lips, "I wot well the sin that is inherent in gold, yet methinks there is some primal curse upon it, put there by Satan before it was laid in earth, which may not cling to the gold that philosophers make."<br><br>And youth and haste again urged another question. "But can the philosophers make gold?" blurted out Ramon Alonzo.<br><br>"Ill-informed lad," said his father, "have you heard of no philosophers during the last ten centuries seeking for gold with their stone?"<br><br>"Yes," answered Ramon Alonzo, "but I heard of none that found it."<br><br>And his father shook his head with tolerant smiles and answered nothing at once, not hastening to reprove the lad's ill-founded opinion, for the wisdom of age expects these light conclusions from youth. And then he instructed his son in simple words, telling him that the value of gold lies not in any especial power in the metal, but purely in its rarity; and explaining so that a child could have understood, that had these most learned of men who gave their lives to alchemy acquainted the vulgar with the fruits of their study, as soon as their art had taught them the way of transmuting base metal, they would have undone in one garrulous moment the advantage that they had earned by nights of toil, working in lonely towers while all the world had rest. And more simple arguments he added, sufficient to correct the hasty error of youth, but too obvious and trite to offer to the attention of my reader. Having then explained that the philosopher's stone must have been often found and put to the use for which it wa<br>s intended, he recommended the study of it once more to his son. And the young man weighed the advantages of gold with all that he had learned in its disfavour, and there and then decided to follow that study. Gladly then the Lord of the Tower and Rocky Forest went to this rummage-room where strange things lay and none interfered with the spider. And in that dim place where one scarce could have hoped to find anything, amongst heaps of old fishing nets that had become solid with dust, where worn-out boar-spears lay on the floor, and rusted bandilleros that had once pricked famous bulls, blunt knives and broken tent-pegs, and things too old for one to be able to name them at all, unless one washed them and brought them out in the light, groping amongst all these the Lord of the Tower found a pale heap of boars' tusks, and the scroll amongst them, as he had told his son: then he left the place to the spider. And returning with the scroll to his son he brought also a coffer out of another room, a small stout bo<br>x of oak and massive silver, well guarded by a great lock, all lined within with satin. And he took a great key and carefully unlocked it, and showed it to Ramon Alonzo as he gave him the scroll of the magician; he held the coffer open with the light blue satin showing and said never a word; the young man knew it for the coffer of his sister's dowry and saw that it was empty. And by the time his father had closed the box again, and carefully locked it and placed the key in safety, the boy's young thoughts had roamed away to beyond Aragona to the man with the black silk cloak and his house in the wood, where base metals would have to suffer wonderful changes before good thick pieces of dross should chink deep on that satin lining. And where young thoughts have roamed there soon follow lads or maidens.<br><br>And then they talked of the way beyond Aragona, and the path that led to the wood. And the father leaned in his chair in comfort at ease, for it wearied him to speak of things that are hard to understand, and especially the getting of money; and he had thought of this matter for days before he had spoken of it, and it had never seemed sure to him that the money would come at all, but now all seemed clear and he rested. And leaning back in his chair he told the way to his son, which was easy as far as the wood, and after that he could ask the way of such men as he met; and if he met none he was likely near to the house, for men avoided it much. Awhile they talked of things of little moment, small matters pleasant to both, till the father remembered that more than this was seemly, and reminded his son of all such things as he himself knew that concerned the decorum and gravity of the study of magic. Indeed he knew little of this ancient study, but had once seen a conjuror produce a rabbit alive from under an em<br>pty sombrero, years ago outside a village in which he had sought to purchase a cow, and it was this that he meant when he spoke of the slight acquaintance he had himself had with magic; for the rest he spoke of the hoar traditions of magic, which were as antique then as now, for then as now they went back past the first gates of history, and ran far on the wide plains of legend and into the dimness of time.<br><br>"To such traditions," he said, "a grave decorum were fitting."<br><br>And the young man nodded his head, his face full of a fitting decorum. And the father remembered his own youth and wondered.<br><br>They parted then, the Lord of the Tower and Rocky Forest going to find his lady, the young man still in his chair before the fire, pondering his journey and his future calling. These thoughts were too swift to follow: pursuing instead the slow steps of his father we find him come to a room in which, already, discernible shadows were cast by a want of gold. With its ancient sentinel chairs that seemed posted there to check lounging, and its treasures of tapestries hung to hide ruined panels or wherever the draughts blew most from untended rat-holes, that threatened room would scarce convey to our minds, could we see it across the centuries, any hint of impending need. And yet those shadows were there, moving softly as in slow dances with the solemn folds of the tapestry, or rising to welcome draughts in their secret manner, or lurking by the huge carved feet of the chairs; and always knowing with shadow-knowledge and whispering with shadow-talk, and hinting and prophesying and fearing, that a need was nearing <br>the Tower to trouble its years. And here the Lord of the Tower found his lady, whose hair was whitening above a face unperturbed by the passing of time or anything that time brings; if great passions had shaken her mind or wandering imaginations often troubled it, they had passed across that plump and placid face with no more traces than the storms and the ships leave on the yellow sand of a sunny cove.<br><br>And he said to her: "I have spoken with Ramon Alonzo and have arranged everything with him. He is to leave us soon to work with a learned man that lives beyond Aragona, and will win for us the gold that we require and, afterwards, some more for himself."<br><br>More than this he did not say upon that matter, for it was not his way, nor was it then the custom in Spain to speak of business to ladies.<br><br>And the lady rejoiced at this, for she had long tried to make her husband see that need that was sending its shadows to creep through the Tower, telling every nook of its coming; but the boars had to be hunted, and the hounds had to be fed, and a hundred things demanded his attention, so that she feared he might never have leisure to give his mind to this matter. But now it was all settled.<br><br>"Will Ramon Alonzo start soon?" she said.<br><br>"Not for some days," said he. "There is no haste."<br><br>But Ramon Alonzo's swifter thoughts had outpac...</p><h2>Peril at End House</h2><p>On holiday on the Cornish Riviera, Hercule Poirot is alarmed to hear pretty Nick Buckley describe her recent &#34;accidental brushes with death.&#34; First, on a treacherous Cornish hillside, the brakes on her car failed.

All its pieces neatly in place, Siege is 10 percent setup and 90 percent slam-bang action, escalating from one massive spectacle to the next as America&#x2019;s top law enforcer, the nefarious Norman Osborn, launches an attack against the earth-bound Asgard, leading to the death of established characters (one in the goriest money shot in modern mainstream comics), the return of the not-quite-dead-after-all Captain America, and a whole new status quo for Marvel&#x2019;s foreseeable future.

Clark was prescient in making this series: the upheavals of the century, the Cold War among others, convinced him of the power of barbarism and the fragility of culture. He would burnish his image with two memoirs that artfully omitted the more complicated details of his life. Now, drawing on a vast, previously unseen archive, James Stourton reveals the formidable intellect and the private man behind the figure who effortlessly dominated the art world for more than half a century: his privileged upbringing, his interest in art history beginning at Oxford, his remarkable early successes. At 27 he was keeper of Western Art at the Ashmolean in Oxford and at 29, the youngest director of The National Gallery. During the war he arranged for its entire collection to be hidden in slate mines in Wales and organized packed concerts of classical music at the Gallery to keep up the spirits of Londoners during the bombing. WWII helped shape his belief that art should be brought to the widest audience, a social and moral position that would inform the rest of his career. Television became a means for this message when he was appointed the first chairman of the Independent Television Authority. Stourton reveals the tortuous state of his marriage during and after the war, his wife's alcoholism, and the aspects of his own nature that he worked to keep hidden. A superb work of biography, <i>Kenneth Clark</i> is a revelation of its remarkable subject.</p><p><b>JAMES STOURTON</b>, the former chairman of Sotheby's U.K., is the author of many books, including <i>Great Houses of London</i> and <i>Great Collectors of Our Time</i>. A lecturer on history, he is also a senior fellow of the Institute of Historical Research at the University of London.1<br><br> &#x2018;K&#x2019;<br><br> <i>Everything about Lord Clark is unexpected.</i><br> &#x2014;Anthony Powell, reviewing <i>Another Part of the Wood</i>[1]<br><br> At 12 noon on Sunday, 25 March 1934, King George V and Queen Mary climbed the steps of the National Gallery in London. It was the first time a reigning monarch had visited the gallery. The ostensible reason for the visit was to see the gallery&#x2019;s collection of paintings, but the real purpose was to meet the new thirty-year-old director, Kenneth Clark. The trustees had been told not to disturb their weekend&#x2014;a gentle instruction that their presence was not required&#x2014;the King wished to see the director. Clark had only been at the gallery for three months, and his appointment had been greeted with universal approval&#x2014;except at Windsor Castle. The King and Queen had been advised two years earlier by Owen Morshead, the Royal Librarian, that Clark would be the perfect candidate for the anticipated vacancy of Surveyor of the King&#x2019;s Pictures. But Clark neither wanted the job nor felt that he could possibly combine it with his heavy duties as director of the National Gallery. The sixty-nine-year-old King Emperor, in an extraordinary move, decided that he would directly intervene and go down to Trafalgar Square to invite the young man to work for him. He had resolved that Clark was the man he wanted, and where his courtiers had failed, he would persuade him personally. The visit was a success, and the two men&#x2014;as different as can be&#x2014;found much to enjoy together. Clark later described how just after proclaiming that Turner was mad, the King &#x2018;stopped his routine progress, faced me and said&#x2019;:<br><br> &#x2018;Why won&#x2019;t you come and work for me?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Because I wouldn&#x2019;t have time to do the job properly.&#x2019;<br><br> The King snorted with benevolent rage: &#x2018;What is there to do?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Well, sir, the pictures need looking after.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with them.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;And people write letters asking for information about them.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t answer them. <i>I want you to take the job.</i>&#x2019;[2]<br><br>There is no other recorded occasion of George V making such an effort&#x2014;for instance, he never visited Downing Street&#x2014;let alone for a thirty-year-old aesthete whose interests were as far as can be imagined from those of a gruff, pheasant-shooting, philistine sailor King. What was it about Kenneth Clark that made him so ardent? Clark had already had a similar effect on a series of distinguished elders, who all seem to have believed that they had discovered him: Monty Rendall, his headmaster at Winchester; Charles Bell, the keeper at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford; Maurice Bowra, the Warden of Wadham College; Bernard Berenson, the most famous connoisseur in the world; and Sir Philip Sassoon, the chairman of the National Gallery. He was a <i>Wunderkind </i>from a brilliant generation of Oxford undergraduates; everybody recognised from the beginning that he would achieve great things (so often a recipe for lassitude in later life). Intelligence, charm and charisma played an important part in his story, but he was not alone in possessing these. What set him apart was his focus and complete absorption in art at a time when&#x2014;artists aside&#x2014;this was a singular quality. And he brought to this absorption an unusually synthetic power of analysis, expressed in a supple prose style that was able to fuse thought and feeling.<br><br> Early in life Clark discovered a sensibility to works of beauty: &#x2018;Ever since I can remember, that is to say from about the age of seven, the combination of certain words, or sounds or forms has given me a peculiar pleasure, unlike anything else in my experience.&#x2019;[3] He called it &#x2018;a freak aptitude&#x2019;, and told a friend, &#x2018;What is certain is that without it I would have been no more than an obscure and timid playboy.&#x2019;[4] This love of art in all its forms sustained him, and in one of the characteristically teasing yet self-revealing passages of his autobiography he remarked: &#x2018;A strong, catholic approach to works of art is like a comfortable Swiss Bank ... I never doubted the infallibility of my judgements ... This almost insane self-confidence lasted until a few years ago, and the odd thing is how many people have accepted my judgements. My whole life has been a harmless confidence trick.&#x2019;[5] The confidence of youth was followed by the doubt of age.<br><br>Self-doubt is the last quality that anybody meeting Clark for the first time would have suspected. Most people were terrified of him and feared being snubbed, an attitude that baffled Clark himself, who was always expected to be one thing but was invariably something else. A folklore grew up around him&#x2014;&#x2018;impossibly, implausibly, supernaturally debonair&#x2019;; &#x2018;delicately poised between diffidence and disdain&#x2019;; &#x2018;a tranquil ruthlessness&#x2019;; &#x2018;he measured people and turned on an appropriate amount of charm&#x2019;&#x2014;were all opinions offered about Clark. Most descriptions refer back to his solitary and protected childhood. His introversion suggested to many that he possessed no &#x2018;radar,&#x2019; or much perception of other people&#x2019;s feelings; he could appear self-absorbed, and often cut people without even realising it. Yet those who worked for him&#x2014;cooks and secretaries adored him&#x2014;found him easy, and even cosy. There was a private Clark and a public Clark, one funny and warm, the other formal.<br><br> As Anthony Powell suggested, everything about Clark was surprising&#x2014;he might have added contradictory and paradoxical: the writer who loved action, the scholar who became a populariser, the socialist who lived in a castle, the committee man who despised the establishment, the indefatigable self-deprecator whom many found arrogant, the shy man who loved monsters, the &#x2018;ruthless&#x2019; man who hated confrontation, the brilliantly successful man who considered himself as a failure, the mandarin who had a passion for lemonade and ice cream. The impenetrably smooth performer had a highly emotional side, weeping in front of works of art and subject to spiritual and religious experiences. Graham Sutherland, who knew him as well as anybody, and lived in his house during the war, said: &#x2018;of course K is a divided man ... &amp; of all my friends the most complex.&#x2019; Behind all this was a mania for independence&#x2014;never wishing to be caught or identified with any group except artists. As one confidante put it, &#x2018;He was nervous of contamination.&#x2019;[6]<br><br>There are many Kenneth Clarks to describe: the museum director, the courtier, the darling of society, the Leonardo expert, the man of action, the wartime publicist, the would-be contemplative scholar, the lecturer and journalist, the administrator and the professor, the television mogul and performer, the public intellectual, the non-academic art historian, the collector, the patron, the committee man, the conservationist, the family man and the lover&#x2014;the sum of the man is equal to the parts. Describing Clark&#x2019;s apparently detached progress through life, his younger son Colin thought that parents, schooling, wife, child and art all just flowed by like interesting scenery, and his father was scarcely aware that &#x2018;there were other human beings on the planet until he was about twenty-eight years old.&#x2019;[7] Worldly or unworldly, Clark expected to go onto boards and for women to fall in love with him. It did not seem odd to him that he was offered the chairmanship of the Independent Television board without ever having owned a television.<br><br> An appetite for public service, born out of the ethos of Winchester, informed Clark&#x2019;s life; a belief that the elite justified their position through <i>pro bono </i>public works. What was unique about him was his position, through which the creative and academic worlds met those of power and influence. As early as 1959 the <i>Sunday Times </i>thought that &#x2018;It will be difficult to write the definitive history of England in the twentieth century without some reference, somewhere, to Sir Kenneth McKenzie Clark.&#x2019;[8] His role in public life, broadcasting apart, is less obvious to us today; the evidence lies in the minutes of meetings preserved in archives such as Bournemouth (the Independent Broadcasting Authority) and Kew (the Ministry of Information). There are, however, the astonishing outcomes: his hand helped build and guide arts institutions that we all take for granted today: the Arts Council, the Royal Opera House, Independent Television, the National Theatre and countless others. Everybody agreed that his writ ran everywhere: &#x2018;K Clark doesn&#x2019;t think much of it&#x2019; was a knockout blow in debate.[9] His success on committees was based on an exceptionally careful reading of the papers, an acute analysis of the options, and a well-thought-out response. He would rarely be the first to speak, and waited to be asked his opinion, which was usually the one that counted. Everybody wanted to know what Clark thought. This was rarely predictable, and in writing this biography I have found that it was impossible to be sure what Clark would think on any subject. Anita Brookner wrote of the &#x2018;unshakeable fairness of outlook [which] may have been his most extraordinary achievement.&#x2019;[10] Clark, however, rarely looked back with satisfaction, and even had a sense of disappointment with his contribution to most of the institutions and boards he joined&#x2014;except for Covent Garden and the Scottish National Gallery.<br><br>What is certain is that Clark never wasted a minute more than he wanted to with people, subjects or institutions. He was extraordinarily disciplined with his time. Everything was timetabled&#x2014;even friendship and love affairs. He was a master of disengagement. His only relaxation was to write, and what a master of prose he was. If his books are still read today, it is as much as anything because of the pleasure of reading about art described in such beautiful language. Books, lectures, essays and letters poured from his pen in those snatched moments when he was not engaged in public life. The constant question I asked myself while writing this book was, how on earth did he manage to do it all?<br><br> Clark always portrayed himself as something of a loner; he honed his lecturing skills as a child, soliloquising on country walks. But he needed an audience; he was a natural teacher who could make any subject interesting. When he was not lecturing to the public, his audience was invariably female&#x2014;Clark was always most at ease with women. His greatest pleasure in life was to share his interests with a woman. The first of these was his wife Jane. What an extraordinary figure she was: moody, mercurial, expansive, generous, clever, rash, destructive, fascinating, pathetic and magnificent. No single description could ever remotely describe Jane, who Clark needed as ivy needs oak. Her unusual powers of sympathy were exercised on everyone from Margot Fonteyn to the station porters at Sandling, and were matched at home by a shrew-like anger of astonishing force. She is the key to understanding Clark&#x2014;she was to support him and persecute him, and this cycle was the pattern of their life together. Clark and women are inseparable&#x2014;they fascinated him, and he made the second half of his life unusually complicated by a series of <i>amiti�s amoureuses</i>. But Jane was the greatest love affair of his life, however strange this may appear as the story unfolds.<br><br> Clark&#x2019;s sharpest critics were drawn from his own profession. As the <i>Burlington Magazine </i>pointed out: &#x2018;It has become almost a habit, among a very small minority, to sneer at Clark&#x2019;s lifestyle.&#x2019;[11] The fact that he lived in a castle made him an irresistible target, and so did his inability to fit into the world of professional art history. With notable exceptions such as Ernst Gombrich and John Pope-Hennessy, his professional peers increasingly viewed him from the 1960s onwards as a non-academic television presenter and literary figure. He did himself no favours by once comparing their scholarly minutiae to knitting. But to the world beyond the Courtauld Institute of Art, whether highbrow or middlebrow, Clark came to represent the popular idea of an art historian. He became an emblem of art and culture to the public. Clark&#x2019;s own hero in this endeavour was the great nineteenth-century writer and thinker John Ruskin. His debt to Ruskin can never be sufficiently emphasised, and it informed many of his interests: the Gothic Revival, J.M.W. Turner, socialism, and the belief that art criticism can be a branch of literature. But above all, Ruskin taught Clark that art and beauty are everyone&#x2019;s birthright&#x2014;and he took that message into the twentieth century. This is the central point of Kenneth Clark&#x2019;s achievement.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 10 October 1974<br> 2. Clark, <i>Another Part of the Wood</i>, p.237<br> 3.

He took in a deep breath, flooding his already-�infested lungs with more toxic dust. He didn&#x2019;t even notice or care anymore. Right then, the mid-�morning break was all he was thinking of, given that his working day had started at five.</p><p>As the last echoes of the whistle died out around him and with the army of pickaxes now at rest, Maxim heard the distant sound of the Miass River, out by the mouth of the open mine.

He missed the tranquility of the place.</p><p>He missed the open sky and the clean air even more.</p><p>A voice rang out from farther down the tunnel. &#x201c;Hey, Mamo, get your ass over here.

Maxim had laid eyes on the man&#x2019;s daughter only once, and though she was indeed strikingly beautiful, he had no doubt that she could certainly do a lot better than any of the pathetic losers around him toiling deep in the bowels of the earth for a less-�than-�meager wage.</p><p>Maxim fished out a small flask&#x2014;?�a punishable offense&#x2014;?�and took a long swig, then wiped his mouth with a grimy sleeve. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s play, then,&#x201d; he told Vasily. He might as well try to win some money from the leering idiot if he could.</p><p>Stanislav, the most pathetic of the foursome, went first, followed by Pyotr, then Maxim. Then Vasily&#x2019;s turn came around. He slammed his fist down onto a just-�turned Queen of Hearts, rattling the half-�broken wooden table around which the four men sat, then leaned back with a smug smile on his face.</p><p>Maxim didn&#x2019;t flinch. His mind was already drifting away. He felt another odd tingling in his head, like a little tickle really, deep in his brain. For some reason, he thought of how much he hated Ochko. Ev�eryone pretended it was about skill when really luck was all you needed. He much preferred Durak, a game that seemed to be about luck, but was really about skill. He had never once been the last to hold cards in twenty-�seven years of playing that game. It was probably why that leech Vasily refused to play the game with him.</p><p>Vasily&#x2019;s croaky voice broke through his curdled thoughts. &#x201c;Come on, Mamo, deal yourself a card before we all turn to stone.&#x201d;</p><p>Maxim looked down and realized he had turned over his first two cards without even looking at them.</p><p>Stanislav turned a Seven of Clubs, unsurprisingly cutting him out of the game after three cards. Pyotr turned a Two of Spades, giving himself nineteen. He looked nervously at Vasily, whose expression didn&#x2019;t change. The bastard was leading with eighteen. That, and he was a very bad loser. Vasily gestured at Maxim to hurry up and take his turn, presum�ably so he could turn a Three and win the small pile of coins sitting in the middle of the table.</p><p>Maxim really didn&#x2019;t want to let him win. Not that day. Not there, not then. And as he was about to turn his card, he felt a piercing sensation worm its way through the back of his skull. It didn&#x2019;t last for more than a breath. He shook his head, shut his eyes, then opened them again. Whatever it was, it had gone.</p><p>He peeked at his card, then looked up at Vasily. The wiry creep was leering at him and right then, Maxim knew that the man was cheating. He didn&#x2019;t know why, but he was dead sure of it.</p><p>Not only cheating, but looking at him like&#x2014;?�like he hated him. More than hated. Loathed. Despised.</p><p>Like he wanted to kill him.</p><p>And right then, Maxim realized that he loathed Vasily even more. His veins throbbing angrily against his skull, he managed to turn over his card. He watched as Vasily dropped his eyes to take it in. It was a Five of Diamonds. Maxim was also out. Vasily smirked at him and turned his own card. A Four of Hearts. Too many. He had won.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s us, <i>moi lyubimye</i>,&#x201d; Vasily said, all smug and reaching out to gather his winnings. &#x201c;Four hearts, beating as one.&#x201d;</p><p>Maxim&#x2019;s hand shot out to block Vasily, but just as he did, Stanislav turned away from the table and convulsed before throwing up, spewing the contents of his belly onto the cheat&#x2019;s boots.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Fuu!</i> Stanislav, you son of a whore&#x2014;&#x201d; Vasily lurched back from the retching man, then a pained look spread across his face and he fell off the wooden crate on which he had been sitting and hit the ground, clutching his head, knocking over the table and sending the cards flying off.</p><p>Pyotr shot to his feet too, flaring with indignation. &#x201c;Four? What four? I didn&#x2019;t see a four. You filthy cheat.&#x201d;</p><p>Maxim swung his gaze back at Stanislav, whose eyes were bloodshot, as if the force of his retching had blown all the blood vessels in his face, and Maxim knew, knew for sure, that Stanislav had also been cheating. They all had, the swine. They were going to fleece him&#x2014;?�then they were going to hurt him.</p><p>As if to confirm it, Vasily started to laugh. Not just a laugh, a de�monic, deep-�rooted laugh that gushed with contempt and mockery and&#x2014;?�Maxim was sure of it&#x2014;?�hatred.</p><p>Maxim stared at him, rooted to the mine&#x2019;s soil, feeling the sweat seep out of him, unsure of what to do&#x2014;</p><p>He saw Vasily take a step in his direction&#x2014;?�he really didn&#x2019;t look at all well&#x2014;?�then the cheat&#x2019;s eyes went wild and the man stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Pyotr had just embedded Maxim&#x2019;s hack into the side of Vasily&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Maxim lurched back as Vasily hit the ground at his feet, a fountain of blood gushing out of the man&#x2019;s skull. Then he was aware that the pain in the back of his head was back, sharper than before. An intense fear washed over him. He would be next. He was sure of it.</p><p>They were going to kill him unless he killed them first.</p><p>He&#x2019;d never been as sure of anything in his entire life.</p><p>Angry yells erupted from other recesses of the mine as he launched himself at Pyotr, blocking his arm while grabbing the hack and fighting the murderous cheat for it. In the dim light of the lone grimy lantern, he glimpsed Stanislav, back on his feet, going for his pickax too. Everything turned into a blur of claws and swings and shouts and punches until Maxim felt something warm in his hands, something he was absolutely compelled to squeeze until his hands met each other in the middle, and when clarity returned to his eyes, he saw poor Pyotr&#x2019;s eyeless, bloodied face turn a livid purple as he snapped the man&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>All around him, the air was suddenly full of screaming and the sound of steel cleaving through flesh and bone.</p><p>Maxim smiled and sucked in a big lungful of air. He had never heard anything so beautiful&#x2014;?�then something flashed in the corner of his vision.</p><p>He leaned backward as the ax came swinging toward his neck and felt the displaced air blow across his face. He jabbed a fist into his attacker&#x2019;s ribs, then another. Something crunched. He stepped behind the groan�ing man, swung an arm around his throat&#x2014;?�it was Popov, the shift man�ager, who had never even raised his voice the whole time that Maxim had worked there&#x2014;?�and began to choke him.</p><p>Popov dropped to the ground like a sack of beetroot.</p><p>Maxim grabbed the ax from the dead man&#x2019;s hand and immediately buried it in the face of Stanislav, who already had the hack he was hold�ing halfway through an arc toward Maxim&#x2019;s chest. Maxim tried to duck out of its path, but the hack still connected and gouged a large chunk out of his side.</p><p>Stanislav toppled backward and fell to the ground, the ax embedded in his face.</p><p>Maxim dropped to his knees, then keeled over, grabbing his torn flesh with both hands, trying to push the two sides of the wound back together.</p><p>He lay there, writhing on the ground, pain shooting through him, his hands bathed in his own blood, and glanced down the mineshaft. He could barely make out the dimly lit silhouettes of other <i>mudaks</i> up and down the tunnels, hacking away at one another furiously.</p><p>He looked down to the wound in his side. His blood was rippling through his fingers and cascading onto the thick grime of the mine floor. He kept staring at it as the death cries echoed around him and the minutes slipped by, his mind numb, his thoughts adrift in a maelstrom of �confusion&#x2014;?�then a powerful explosion ripped through the air behind him.</p><p>The walls shook, and dust and rock shards rained down on him.</p><p>Three other explosions followed, knocking the lanterns off their mounts and plunging the already-�dark tunnels of the mine into total darkness.</p><p>Everything went deathly silent for a brief moment&#x2014;?�then came a cool breeze and an urgent, rushing sound.</p><p>A rush that turned into a roar.</p><p>Maxim stared into the darkness. He never saw the solid wall of water that plowed into him with the force of an anvil and whisked him away. But in those seconds of consciousness, in those last moments before the water overpowered his lungs and the force of the torrent slammed him against the tunnel wall, Maxim Nikolaev&#x2019;s final thoughts were of his boyhood and of how peaceful it would be to return to the river of his youth.</p><p>Standing by the detonator at the mouth of the tunnel, the man of<br>science listened until all silence returned to the mountain. He was shak�ing visibly, though not from the cold. His companion, on the other hand, was unnaturally calm and serene. Which made the scientist shake even more.</p><p>They had made the long journey together, from the distant isolation of the Siberian monastery to this equally forsaken place. A journey that had started many years ago with the promise of great things, but that had since veered into savage, criminal territory. The man of science couldn&#x2019;t quite put his finger on how they&#x2019;d reached this point of no return, how it had all degenerated into mass murder. And as he stared at his companion, he feared there would be more to come.</p><p>&#x201c;What have we done?&#x201d; he muttered, fearful even as the words snuck past his lips.</p><p>His companion turned to face him. For a man of such power and influence, a man who had become an intimate friend and confidant of the tsar and tsarina, he was unusually dressed. An old, greasy jacket, tattered around the cuffs. Baggy trousers that hung low at the back, like the �<i>serouals</i> worn by the Turks. A farmer&#x2019;s oiled boots. Then there was the wild, tangled beard, and the greasy hair, parted down the middle like that of a tavern waiter. The scientist knew it was all artifice, of course, all part of a calculated look. A craftily honed image for a grand master plan, one in which the man of science had become an enabler and an accom�plice. A costume designed to convey the humbleness and humility of a true man of God. An outfit so basic it also couldn&#x2019;t possibly detract from its wearer&#x2019;s hypnotic, gray-�blue gaze.</p><p>The gaze of a demon.</p><p>&#x201c;What have we done?&#x201d; his companion replied in his odd, simple, almost primordial manner of speech. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you what we&#x2019;ve done, my friend. You and me . . . ?we&#x2019;ve just ensured the salvation of our people.&#x201d;</p><p>As always happened in the other&#x2019;s company, the man of science felt a numbing weakness overcome him. All he could do was stand there and nod. But as he began to digest what they had just done, a stifling dark�ness descended upon him and he wondered about what horrors lay ahead, horrors he would have never imagined possible back in that se�cluded monastery, where he&#x2019;d first met the mysterious peasant. Where the man had brought him back from the edge, shown him the wonder of his gift, and talked to him about his wanderings among the hidden cloisters deep in the forests and the beliefs he had learned there. Where the mystic with the piercing eyes had first told him about the advent of &#x201c;true tsar,&#x201d; a fair ruler, a redeemer of the people born of the common folk. A savior of Holy Rus.</p><p>For the briefest moment, the man of science wondered if he&#x2019;d ever be able to extricate himself from his mentor&#x2019;s hold and avoid the mad�ness that surely lay ahead. But as quickly as the thought had surfaced, it was gone, snuffed out before it could even begin to take shape.</p><p>He&#x2019;d never seen anyone refuse anything of Grigory Efimovich Rasputin.</p><p>And he knew, with crippling certainty, that his will was far from strong enough for him to be the first.</p></p><h2>Bittersweet: A Novel</h2><p><b>Suspenseful and cinematic, <i>Bittersweet</i> exposes the gothic underbelly of&nbsp;an idyllic world of privilege and an outsider&#x2019;s hunger to belong.</b><br><br>On scholarship at a prestigious East Coast college, ordinary Mabel Dagmar is surprised to befriend her roommate,&nbsp;the&nbsp;beautiful, wild, blue-blooded Genevra Winslow.&nbsp;Ev invites Mabel to spend the summer at Bittersweet, her cottage on the Vermont estate where her family has been holding court for more than a century.&nbsp;Mabel falls in love with midnight skinny-dipping, the wet dog smell that lingers near the yachts,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;moneyed laughter that carries across the still lake while fireworks burst overhead.

That&#x2019;s hyperbolic, of course; by February, student housing had required us to share a hot shoe box of a room for nearly six months, so she must have gathered I was a physical reality (if only because I coughed every time she smoked her Kools atop the bunk bed), but until the day Ev asked me to accompany her to Winloch, I was accustomed to her regarding me as she would a hideously upholstered armchair--something in her way, to be utilized when absolutely necessary, but certainly not what she&#x2019;d have chosen herself.<br><br>It was colder that winter than I knew cold could be, even though the girl from Minnesota down the hall declared it &#x201c;nothing.&#x201d; Out in Oregon, snow had been a gift, a two-day dusting earned by enduring months of gray, dripping sky. But the wind whipping up the Hudson from the city was so vehement that even my bone marrow froze. Every morning, I hunkered under my duvet, unsure of how I&#x2019;d make it to my 9:00 a.m. Latin class. The clouds spilled endless white and Ev slept in.<br><br>She slept in with the exception of the first subzero day of the semester. That morning, she squinted at me pulling on the flimsy rubber galoshes my mother had nabbed at Value Village and, without saying a word, clambered down from her bunk, opened our closet, and plopped her brand-new pair of fur-lined L.L.Bean duck boots at my feet. &#x201c;Take them,&#x201d; she commanded, swaying in her silk nightgown above me. What to make of this unusually generous offer? I touched the leather--it was as buttery as it looked. <br><br>&#x201c;I mean it.&#x201d; She climbed back into bed. &#x201c;If you think I&#x2019;m going out in that, in those, you&#x2019;re deranged.&#x201d;<br><br>Inspired by her act of generosity, by the belief that boots must be broken in (and spurred on by the daily terror of a stockpiling peasant--sure, at any moment, I&#x2019;d be found undeserving and sent packing), I forced my frigid body out across the residential quad. Through freezing rain, hail, and snow I persevered, my tubby legs and sheer weight landing me square in the middle of every available snowdrift. I squinted up at Ev&#x2019;s distracted, willowy silhouette smoking from our window, and thanked the gods she didn&#x2019;t look down.<br><br>Ev wore a camel-hair coat, drank absinthe at underground clubs in Manhattan, and danced naked atop Main Gate because someone dared her. She had come of age in boarding school and rehab. Her lipsticked friends breezed through our stifling dorm room with the promise of something better; my version of socializing was curling up with a copy of Jane Eyre after a study break hosted by the house fellows. Whole weeks went by when I didn&#x2019;t see her once. On the few occasions inclement weather hijacked her plans, she instructed me in the ways of the world: (1) drink only hard alcohol at parties because it won&#x2019;t make you fat (although she pursed her lips whenever she said the word in front of me, she didn&#x2019;t shy from saying it), and (2) close your eyes if you ever have to put a penis in your mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t expect your roommate to be your best friend,&#x201d; my mother had offered in the bold voice she reserved for me alone, just before I flew east. Back in August, watching the TSA guy riffle through my granny underpants while my mother waved a frantic good-bye, I shelved her comment in the category of Insulting. I knew all too well that my parents wouldn&#x2019;t mind if I failed college and had to return to clean other people&#x2019;s clothes for the rest of my life; it was a fate they--or at least my father--believed I&#x2019;d sealed for myself only six years before. But by early February, I understood what my mother had really meant; scholarship girls aren&#x2019;t meant to slumber beside the scions of America because doing so whets insatiable appetites.<br><br>The end of the year was in sight, and I felt sure Ev and I had secured our roles: she tolerated me, while I pretended to disdain everything she stood for. So it came as a shock, that first week of February, to receive a creamy, ivory envelope in my campus mailbox, my name penned in India ink across its matte expanse. Inside, I found an invitation to the college president&#x2019;s reception in honor of Ev&#x2019;s eighteenth birthday, to be held at the campus art museum at the end of the month. Apparently, Genevra Katherine Winslow was donating a Degas.<br><br>Any witness to me thrusting that envelope into my parka pocket in the boisterous mail room might have guessed that humble old Mabel Dagmar was embarrassed by the showy decadence, but it was just the opposite--I wanted to keep the exclusive, honeyed sensation of the invitation to myself, lest I discover it was a mistake, or that every single mailbox held one. The gently nubbled paper stock kept my hand warm all day. When I returned to the room, I made sure to leave the envelope prominently on my desk, where Ev liked to keep her ashtray, just below the only picture she had posted in our room, of a good sixty people--young and old, all nearly as good-looking and naturally blond as Ev, all dressed entirely in white--in front of a grand summer cottage. The Winslows&#x2019; white clothing was informal, but it wasn&#x2019;t the kind of casual my family sported (Disneyland T-shirts, potbellies, cans of Heineken). Ev&#x2019;s family was lean, tan, and smiling. Collared shirts, crisp cotton dresses, eyelet socks on the French-braided little girls. I was grateful she had put the picture over my desk; I had ample time to study and admire it.<br><br>It was three days before she noticed the envelope. She was smoking atop her bunk--the room filling with acrid haze as I puffed on my inhaler, huddled over a calculus set just below her--when she let out a groan of recognition, hopping down from her bed and plucking up the invitation. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not coming to this, are you?&#x201d; she asked, waving it around. She sounded horrified at the possibility, her rosebud lips turned down in a distant cousin of ugly--for truly, even in disdain and dorm-room dishevelment, Ev was a sight to behold.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I might,&#x201d; I answered meekly, not letting on that I&#x2019;d been simultaneously ecstatic and fretful over what I would ever wear to such an event, not to mention how I would do anything attractive with my limp hair.<br><br>Her long fingers flung the envelope back onto my desk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be ghastly. Mum and Daddy are angry I&#x2019;m not donating to the Met, so they won&#x2019;t let me invite any of my friends, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said, trying not to sound wounded.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it like that,&#x201d; she snapped, before dropping back into my desk chair and tipping her porcelain face toward the ceiling, frowning at the crack in the plaster.<br><br>&#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t you the one who invited me?&#x201d; I dared to ask.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She giggled, as though my mistake was an adorable transgression. &#x201c;Mum always asks the roommates. It&#x2019;s supposed to make it feel so much more . . . democratic.&#x201d; She saw the look on my face, then added, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even want to be there; there&#x2019;s no reason you should.&#x201d; She reached for her Mason Pearson hairbrush and pulled it over her scalp. The boar bristles made a full, thick sound as she groomed herself, golden hair glistening.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; I offered, the disappointment in my voice betraying me. I turned back to my math. It was better not to go--I would have embarrassed myself. But by then, Ev was looking at me, and continuing to stare--her eyes boring into my face--until I could bear her gaze no more. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked, testing her with irritation (but not too much; I could hardly blame her for not wanting me at such an elegant affair).<br><br>&#x201c;You know about art, right?&#x201d; she asked, the sudden sweetness in her voice drawing me out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of majoring in art history?&#x201d;<br><br>I was surprised--I had no idea Ev had any notion of my interests. And although, in truth, I&#x2019;d given up the thought of becoming an art history major--too many hours taking notes in dark rooms, and I wasn&#x2019;t much for memorization, and I was falling in love with the likes of Shakespeare and Milton--I saw clearly that an interest in art was my ticket in.<br><br>&#x201c;I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Ev beamed, her smile a break between thunderheads. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make you a dress,&#x201d; she said, clapping. &#x201c;You look pretty in blue.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;d noticed.<br>Chapter Two<br><br>The Party<br><br>Three weeks later, I found myself standing in the main, glassy hall of the campus art museum, a silk dress the color of the sea deftly draped and seamed so I appeared twenty pounds lighter. At my elbow stood Ev, in a column of champagne shantung. She looked like a princess, and, as for a princess, the rules did not apply; we held full wineglasses with no regard for the law, and no one, not the trustees or professors or senior art history majors who paraded by, each taking the time to win her smile, batted an eye as we sipped the alcohol. A single violinist teased out a mournful melody in the far corner of the room. The president--a doyenne of the first degree, her hair a helmet of gray, her smile practiced in the art of raising institutional monies--hovered close at hand. Ev introduced me to spare herself the older woman&#x2019;s attention, but I was flattered by the president&#x2019;s interest in my studies (&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we can get you into that upper-level Milton seminar&#x201d;), though eager to extract myself from her company in the interest of more time with Ev.<br><br>Ev whispered each guest&#x2019;s name into the whorl of my ear--how she kept track of them, even now I do not know, except that she had been bred for it--and I realized that somehow, inexplicably, I had ended up the guest of honor&#x2019;s guest of honor. Ev may have beguiled each attendee, but it was with me that she shared her most private observations (&#x201c;Assistant Professor Oakley--he&#x2019;s slept with everyone,&#x201d; &#x201c;Amanda Wyn--major eating disorder&#x201d;). Taking it all in, I couldn&#x2019;t imagine why she wouldn&#x2019;t want this: the Degas (a ballerina bent over toe shoes at the edge of a stage), the fawning adults, the celebration of birth and tradition. As much as she insisted she longed for the evening to be over, so did I drink it in, knowing all too well that tomorrow I&#x2019;d be back in her winter boots, slogging through the sleet, praying my financial aid check would come so I could buy myself a pair of mittens.<br><br>The doors to the main hall opened and the president rushed to greet the newest, final guests, parting the crowd. My diminutive stature has never given me advantage, and I strained to see who had arrived--a movie star? an influential artist?--only someone important could have stirred up such a reaction in that academic group.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; I whispered, straining on tiptoe.<br><br>Ev downed her second gin and tonic. &#x201c;My parents.&#x201d;<br><br>Birch and Tilde Winslow were the most glamorous people I&#x2019;d ever seen: polished, buffed, and obviously made of different stuff than I.<br><br>Tilde was young--much younger than my mother. She had Ev&#x2019;s swan-like neck, topped off by a sharper, less exquisite face, although, make no mistake, Tilde Winslow was a beauty. She was skinny, too skinny, and though I recognized in her the signs of years of calorie counting, I&#x2019;ll admit that I admired what the deprivation had done for her--accentuating her biceps, defining the lines of her jaw. Her cheekbones cut like razors across her face. She wore a dress of emerald dupioni silk, done at the waist with a sapphire brooch the size of a child&#x2019;s hand. Her white-blond hair was swept into a chignon.<br><br>Birch was older--Tilde&#x2019;s senior by a good twenty years--and he had the unmovable paunch of a man in his seventies. But the rest of him was lean. His face did not seem grandfatherly at all; it was handsome and youthful, his crystal-blue eyes set like jewels inside the dark, long eyelashes that Ev had inherited from his line. As he and Tilde made their slow, determined way to us, he shook hands like a politician, offering cracks and quips that jollified the crowd. Beside him, Tilde was his polar opposite. She hardly shook a hand or forced a smile, and, when they were finally to us, she looked me over as though I were a dray horse brought in for plowing.<br><br>&#x201c;Genevra,&#x201d; she acknowledged, once satisfied I had nothing to offer.<br><br>&#x201c;Mum.&#x201d; I caught the tightness in Ev&#x2019;s voice, which melted as soon as her father placed his arm around her shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, freckles,&#x201d; he whispered into her perfect ear, tapping her on the nose. Ev blushed. &#x201c;And who,&#x201d; he asked, holding out his hand to me, &#x201c;is this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is Mabel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The roommate!&#x201d; he exclaimed. &#x201c;Miss Dagmar, the pleasure is all mine.&#x201d; He swallowed that awful g at the center of my name and ended with a flourish by rolling the r just so. For once, my name sounded delicate. He kissed my hand.<br><br>Tilde offered a thin smile. &#x201c;Perhaps you can tell us, Mabel, where our daughter was over Christmas break.&#x201d; Her voice was reedy and thin, with a brief trace of an accent, indistinguishable as pedigreed or foreign.<br><br>Ev&#x2019;s face registered momentary panic.<br><br>&#x201c;She was with me,&#x201d; I answered.<br><br>&#x201c;With you?&#x201d; Tilde asked, seeming to fill with genuine amusement. &#x201c;And what, pray tell, was she doing with you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were visiting my aunt in Baltimore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Baltimore!

Through them we are able to uncover new information concerning the genetic and environmental factors affecting who we are. Studies using identical and fraternal twins hold the keys to understanding our intellectual abilities, personality traits, social attitudes, and behavior. In Entwined Lives, Dr. Nancy Segal brings together cutting-edge information with illustrative case histories of twins and their families. In addition to the fascinating stories of identical twins reared apart and reunited as adults, Dr. Segal provides insights into the unusual language patterns of twins, how twin studies affect legal decisions, the role of fertility treatments in twin and &#34;twinlike&#34; conceptions, and more. This groundbreaking book explores the ways in which twins enhance our knowledge of human behavioral and physical development, while shedding new light on the nature/nurture debate and on the burgeoning field of evolutionary psychology.</p><p>Nancy L. Segal is professor of Developmental Psychology and director of the Twin Studies Center at California State University, Fullerton.The study of twins is a fundamental tool of genetic epidemiology and thus is important to all medical and behavioral sciences. Even in this era of study of the human genome, the definition of phenotypic boundaries in many fields still requires refinement, and genetic and environmental influences require further exploration. Despite their importance, I have heard the results of twin studies described as "opaque" by medical colleagues. They need look no further than Entwined Lives, by Nancy Segal, for clarification. The book covers the various facets of twin research, particularly in the study of behavior, in an accessible and sensible manner. It is ably illustrated with case descriptions and anecdotes of encounters with twins during the author's own work and describes aspects of life as a twin that are not usually included in textbooks, such as grief over the loss of a twin, the special relationship between twins, and legal issues involving twins. Although it focuses on behavior rather than on clinical disorders, the book will be of interest to clinicians because the principles of twin research it explains are widely applicable to an understanding of the human condition.<p> Segal discusses the biologic basis of twinning along with unusual types of "twins," such as unrelated siblings of the same age who are reared together through adoption, and complicated sibling relationships, such as those that can result from modern fertility treatments involving sperm or egg donation or surrogate motherhood. For example, there are twins who had different intrauterine environments because they were carried by different surrogate mothers and, in rare cases, fraternal twins with different fathers. This book deals imaginatively with the ways in which such sibling relationships challenge our notion of twinning and offer new angles for the study of genetic and environmental influences on behavior. Identical twins reared apart offer a rare opportunity to examine similarities between persons who are genetically identical but do not share a common environment; such work is eloquently described and illustrated with fascinating cases. The importance of differences between the members of separated pairs is also highlighted, since these differences tell us as much about environmental influences on behavior as they do about genetic influences. </p><p> There are interesting chapters on what twin studies can tell us about athleticism, intelligence, personality, and mental disorders, but because the emphasis here is on behavior (as the title of the book suggests), a detailed review of studies of mental disorders in twins is outside its scope. For anyone interested in twin research, this book will provide a wealth of information illustrated with real-life examples and written in an understandable, readable style. Its wide-ranging and up-to-date content makes it a valuable review of all aspects of twin research. </p><p> <i>Reviewed by Jane Scourfield, M.R.C.Psych.</i> <br>Copyright � 2000 Massachusetts Medical Society.

In this brilliant assemblage of his writings on music, the first such collection in nearly twenty years, Baraka blends autobiography, history, musical analysis, and political commentary to recall the sounds, people, times, and places he's encountered. As in his earlier classics, <i>Blues People </i>and <i>Black Music, </i>Baraka offers essays on the famous&#x2014;Max Roach, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane&#x2014;and on those whose names are known mainly by jazz aficionados&#x2014;Alan Shorter, Jon Jang, and Malachi Thompson. Baraka's literary style, with its deep roots in poetry, makes palpable his love and respect for his jazz musician friends. His energy and enthusiasm show us again how much Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and the others he lovingly considers mattered. He brings home to us how music itself matters, and how musicians carry and extend that knowledge from generation to generation, providing us, their listeners, with a sense of meaning and belonging.</p><p>"As a commentator on American music, and African American music in particular, Baraka occupies a unique niche. His intelligence, critical sense, passion, strong political stances, involvement with musicians and in the musical world, as well as in his community, give his work a quality unlike any other. As a reviewer and as someone inside the movement, he writes powerfully about music as few others can or do."&#x2014;Steven L. Isoardi, author of <i>Central Avenue Sounds: Jazz in Los Angeles</i><br><br>"Every jazz musician who has endured beyond changing fashions and warring cultures has had a signature sound. Amiri Baraka&#x2014;from the very beginning of his challenging, fiery presence on the jazz scene&#x2014;has brought probing light, between his off-putting thunderclaps, on what is indeed America's classical music. I sometimes disagree insistently with Amiri, and it's mutual; but when he gets past his parochial pyrotechnics, as in choruses in this book, he brings you into the life force of this music."&#x2014;Nat Hentoff, author of <i>The Jazz Life </i><b>Amiri Baraka </b>(formerly LeRoi Jones) is a writer and critic, the poet laureate of New Jersey, and Professor Emeritus of the State University of New York, Stony Brook.

Turning the gaze of the ethnographic camera back onto itself, bringing the perspective of a third eye to bear on the invention of the primitive other, Rony reveals the collaboration of anthropology and popular culture in Western constructions of race, gender, nation, and empire. Her work demonstrates the significance of these constructions&#x2014;and, more generally, of ethnographic cinema&#x2014;for understanding issues of identity.<br>In films as seemingly dissimilar as <i>Nanook of the North</i>, <i>King Kong</i>, and research footage of West Africans from an 1895 Paris ethnographic exposition, Rony exposes a shared fascination with&#x2014;and anxiety over&#x2014;race. She shows how photographic &#x201c;realism&#x201d; contributed to popular and scientific notions of evolution, race, and civilization, and how, in turn, anthropology understood and critiqued its own use of photographic technology. Looking beyond negative Western images of the Other, Rony considers performance strategies that disrupt these images&#x2014;for example, the use of open resistance, recontextualization, and parody in the films of Katherine Dunham and Zora Neale Hurston, or the performances of Josephine Baker. She also draws on the work of contemporary artists such as Lorna Simpson and Victor Masayesva Jr., and writers such as Frantz Fanon and James Baldwin, who unveil the language of racialization in ethnographic cinema.<br>Elegantly written and richly illustrated, innovative in theory and original in method, <i>The Third Eye</i> is a remarkable interdisciplinary contribution to critical thought in film studies, anthropology, cultural studies, art history, postcolonial studies, and women&#x2019;s studies.</p><p>&#34;&#34;The Third Eye&#34; is an extraordinary contribution to both film history and the theorization of the ethnographic gaze. Informed by Rony&#39;s close involvement with contemporary art practice and documentary film production, this fascinating book breaks with familiar genres of academic writing to provide an exciting new take on practices of ethnographic looking, the cultural history of the body, and the racial and sexual politics of visual culture in colonial science.&#34;--Lisa Cartwright, University of Rochester<p>Fatimah Tobing Rony is Assistant Professor of Film Studies at the University of California, Irvine.<br></p></p><h2>The Pennsylvania Germans: A Celebration of Their Arts, 1683-1850: An Exhibition Organized by The Philadelphia Museum of Art &amp; The Henry Francis Dupont Winterthur Museum</h2><p>The seminal idea for this exhibition grew out of a desire to reestablish for a national audience the vitality inherent in the original arts of the Pennsylvania Germans and to explore in-depth the particular contributions that they made to American arts and crafts.

With persistent observation, gentle intuition, and a keen desire to help people with the problems of their lives, she solves mysteries great and small for friends and strangers alike.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, July 2001:</b> Working in a mystery tradition that will cause genre aficionados to think of such classic sleuths as Melville Davisson Post's Uncle Abner or Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee, Alexander McCall Smith creates an African detective, Precious Ramotswe, who's their full-fledged heir. <p> It's the detective as folk hero, solving crimes through an innate, self-possessed wisdom that, combined with an understanding of human nature, invariably penetrates into the heart of a puzzle. If Miss Marple were fat and jolly and lived in Botswana--and decided to go against any conventional notion of what an unmarried woman should do, spending the money she got from selling her late father's cattle to set up a Ladies' Detective Agency--then you have an idea of how Precious sets herself up as her country's first female detective. Once the clients start showing up on her doorstep, Precious enjoys a pleasingly successful series of cases. </p> <p> But the edge of the Kalahari is not St. Mary Mead, and the sign Precious orders, painted in brilliant colors, is anything but discreet. Pointing in the direction of the small building she had purchased to house her new business, it reads "THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES. UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT." </p> <p> The solutions she comes up with, whether in the case of the clinic doctor with two quite different personalities (depending on the day of the week), or the man who had joined a Christian sect and seemingly vanished, or the kidnapped boy whose bones may or may not be those in a witch doctor's magic kit, are all sensible, logical, and satisfying. Smith's gently ironic tone is full of good humor towards his lively, intelligent heroine and towards her fellow Africans, who live their lives with dignity and with cautious acceptance of the confusions to which the world submits them. Precious Ramotswe is a remarkable creation, and <i>The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</i> well deserves the praise it received from London's <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>. I look forward with great eagerness to the upcoming books featuring the memorable Miss Ramotswe, <i>Tears of the Giraffe</i> and <i>Morality for Beautiful Girls</i>, soon to be available in the U.S. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>This first novel in Alexander McCall Smith?s widely acclaimed The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series tells the story of the delightfully cunning and enormously engaging Precious Ramotswe, who is drawn to her profession to ?help people with problems in their lives.?
